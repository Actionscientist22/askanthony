1
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.650
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna repeat a lot of what you guys just heard. But Rodney had a great question during office hours.

2
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.860
Anthony Taylor: and he said, should we bring it up during office or during class, I said, Sure, go for it. So go ahead, Rodney, ask a question.

3
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:36.939
Masarirambi, Rodney: So as we've been doing this course? We. And we talked about this earlier. One of the questions I've had is, where are we gonna end up at the end of this course, because everything seems to change with every week, and as I see jobs stuff like that, I'm like, Yup, we've only heard Boom Bloss that boom plus that.

4
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.239
Masarirambi, Rodney: where are we going to be?

5
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:50.279
Anthony Taylor: So it's a great question. And and it's I'm gonna shorten my answer from earlier, because we're in class time. all right. But the answer is that.

6
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.589
Anthony Taylor: And and and you know what what I'm doing. So

7
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.609
Anthony Taylor: with my data, science students, I always said.

8
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.950
Anthony Taylor: you're learning all of these different tools.

9
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And I don't mean tools like Python versus

10
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:17.660
Anthony Taylor: Vba. I mean different ways to do things. Different skill sets that are out there on the market today and and think of it like Batman's utility belt.

11
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.760
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Or if you prefer a construction workers, tool belt whatever.

12
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:36.349
Anthony Taylor: Okay? I like Batman's utility. anyway. right? And each of these skills are fitting into one of those slots in that belt. each of those skills you can use to get a job.

13
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:49.939
Anthony Taylor: So when we started with just the straight python data analysis stuff. any of that. That's a job. That's that's a real position. a data analyst with python skill set

14
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.370
Anthony Taylor: 100%.

15
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:59.680
Anthony Taylor: Okay? As we've transitioned into the machine learning models and stuff, you guys are are

16
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:07.620
Anthony Taylor: getting pretty deep into the data science space data, scientists, positions are a little harder to get

17
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.630
Anthony Taylor: as an entry level. But

18
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:18.630
Anthony Taylor: with your combine that with your data analyst skills, you become a lot more tempting to an employer.

19
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.740
Anthony Taylor: Because now you have data analyst skills. And you have enough data science that you can

20
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.860
Anthony Taylor: take the company in that direction.

21
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.150
Anthony Taylor: okay, or or be part of that journey which makes you more market.

22
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.690
Anthony Taylor: As we go into.

23
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.419
Anthony Taylor: you know, some of the more advanced, closer to AI skill sets.

24
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:49.919
Anthony Taylor: That's when you're going to start seeing. Okay. Now, we're starting to understand how to extend our AI models.

25
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.740
Anthony Taylor: And that's where the program was gonna take is going to take you. The good news is

26
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.520
Anthony Taylor: is that I see

27
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.420
Anthony Taylor: that there are other areas that we could take you guys down in the AI path

28
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:19.459
Anthony Taylor: and give you some other slots for your tool belt. Okay? Which is why we did that extra review the other day. It was short. but I don't know if you guys realize just how powerful that was.

29
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:30.100
Anthony Taylor: what we did. And the next one's gonna add to that. And I'm gonna build on that until we get to the end. And you guys are going to be able to create rather elaborate

30
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.970
Anthony Taylor: applications that you probably would not have been taught.

31
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.149
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And it's not that

32
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:44.390
Anthony Taylor: the program didn't include them for any good reason. There's a good reason why they didn't include, because they don't want to cost you money.

33
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.750
Anthony Taylor: and this the open AI stuff and that stuff.

34
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.410
Anthony Taylor: It can cost you money. And I'm telling you, if you don't want to do your app. That's why it's extra.

35
00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.579
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if you want to do. It might cost you a couple of bucks maps.

36
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.870
Anthony Taylor: but you know, as long as you do what I say, you'll be fine. It won't cost you much anymore.

37
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.280
Anthony Taylor: I still haven't broke, you know, 2 bucks yet ever

38
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.190
Anthony Taylor: on my open AI stuff.

39
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.050
Anthony Taylor: So anyway, so to answer your question, Rodney, you're gonna have a lot of doors.

40
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:28.250
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to be honest with all of you. When I say this next day your skill set is going to be far and above most people that you meet in the trying to get these same jobs.

41
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.680
Anthony Taylor: But somehow or another, you gotta get to that technical interface

42
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.090
Anthony Taylor: alright, and that I can't help you. I mean, I give you thanks. But

43
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.809
Anthony Taylor: that and that's the

44
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.780
Anthony Taylor: you know the big thing that that is.

45
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:50.609
Anthony Taylor: the ones that get to that technical interview with this skill set

46
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.900
Anthony Taylor: are going to get rewarded. Most likely.

47
00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:02.089
Anthony Taylor: All right. It's but that's why I always talk about. Look back at what you've done before. Try to tie that into

48
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:08.430
Anthony Taylor: that, or you'll find jobs that tie what you did before with your new data skills and then

49
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.530
Anthony Taylor: move forward. Okay.

50
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:13.570
okay.

51
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.540
Anthony Taylor: James, thank you for agreeing with me.

52
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.610
Anthony Taylor: So awesome.

53
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:32.869
Anthony Taylor: Any thoughts questions it can. Yes, and chat. TV's very, very good at that. But you gotta be good at asking it the right questions.

54
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:40.120
Anthony Taylor:  to make sure that you, you get what you need because it can't. Yes, everything. And

55
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:49.910
Anthony Taylor: I'm telling you guys, one of the reasons why I'm so good at this advice is cause I've been the interviewer for hundreds of positions.

56
00:05:50.720 --> 00:06:00.219
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And I intentionally make it so that. you know, sites like nerd interview, which gives you questions that companies ask.

57
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.119
Anthony Taylor: Right? I make sure I don't have acids.

58
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.089
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So

59
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.390
Anthony Taylor: chat Gvtts will be the same thing. I'm going to look up what Chat Gvt's gonna gonna

60
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.539
Anthony Taylor: tell me to ask you. And I'm not gonna ask this question

61
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:25.729
Anthony Taylor: alright, because it doesn't. I don't learn anything just like won't learn anything, you know, like we said from day one with Chat. Gp. Spectacular tool, love it, use it myself every day.

62
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.840
Anthony Taylor: But

63
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.709
Anthony Taylor: if I'm going to learn something, I want it to explain to me what it just said.

64
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.350
Anthony Taylor: and you have to do the same.

65
00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.270
Anthony Taylor: Okay, Hi.

66
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.170
Anthony Taylor: questions, thoughts. Anything going? Once.

67
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.190
Anthony Taylor: going twice.

68
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.769
Anthony Taylor: Okay, let's get to class.

69
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.579
Anthony Taylor: Thank you for appreciating that.

70
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.750
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

71
00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:03.729
Anthony Taylor: we are recording. We are ready. So today we start a new

72
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.850
Anthony Taylor: form of modeling.

73
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.639
Anthony Taylor: We actually started supervised last week.

74
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:26.989
Anthony Taylor: right? Because many of our linear regression models and our regression models. They had labeled data. So we were training with labeled data. So therefore, we were doing supervisor.

75
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:34.960
Anthony Taylor: The most common use of supervised is actually classification. So let's talk about

76
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.990
Anthony Taylor: today. And

77
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:56.869
Anthony Taylor: we're going to. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to understand explain the principles of a linear classification model, a lot of review. We're gonna talk about a logistic regression model that works as a binary classifier. This is a little misleading. It has regression in the name.

78
00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.619
Anthony Taylor: But it's not really regression, I mean not.

79
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.499
Anthony Taylor: It's not used as regression to be clear.

80
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.570
Anthony Taylor: We're going to talk about an Sbm model

81
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.609
Anthony Taylor: very, very cool allows us to do multi classifiers

82
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.120
Anthony Taylor: as well as binding.

83
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:19.140
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna implement logistic regression, Svm and test their performance. So we're gonna score.

84
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.260
Anthony Taylor: What's the default score of psychit? Learn?

85
00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.390
Derek Rikke: What is it? R. 2.

86
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:34.600
Anthony Taylor: Thank you, Derrick. Derek saves the day so often.

87
00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:41.620
Anthony Taylor: and we're gonna compare and contrast. Look parent contrast different data scaling. So we're gonna talk more about data scaling.

88
00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:45.379
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna be honest with you. This is a lot of review in this one.

89
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.659
Anthony Taylor: But that's okay. In the data scaling part, we've talked about standard scalar like near to death.

90
00:08:50.870 --> 00:09:03.790
Anthony Taylor: Okay, well, we're gonna get a little. It's like a that's another way to explain. Okay. nothing wrong with that. Alright. So classification. So

91
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.749
Anthony Taylor: classification is straight up. It's us trying to

92
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.720
Anthony Taylor: predict a label or a title or something.

93
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:26.030
Anthony Taylor: Okay. It's, you know, the official predict discrete value, variable. A discrete value variable has one middle. Its values cannot be divided. So good, bad

94
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:28.480
Anthony Taylor: cat doll

95
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.360
Anthony Taylor: pass fail

96
00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:42.130
Anthony Taylor: now, you could say, Well, isn't past fail divitable? No, we're not looking for the numbers. I want to know if it's pass fail. This class is a binary classification.

97
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.719
Anthony Taylor: You will pass or you will fail.

98
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.579
Anthony Taylor: You will not get a 70%

99
00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:52.850
Anthony Taylor: pass or you will fail. That's it. Okay.

100
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.270
Anthony Taylor: so

101
00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:56.670
Anthony Taylor: do you own a car?

102
00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.519
Anthony Taylor: Yes, no, there is no navy.

103
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.159
Anthony Taylor: You can't maybe own a car.

104
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.370
Anthony Taylor: I mean, unless you want to. Tesla.

105
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.860
Anthony Taylor: then maybe

106
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:10.980
Anthony Taylor: okay.

107
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:14.060
Anthony Taylor: Alright?

108
00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:20.760
Anthony Taylor:  but yeah, so you're either doing your joke. There's no middle ground. Okay?

109
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:27.499
Anthony Taylor: we use it usually to do it to categorize things and categorize things can be very broad.

110
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.210
Anthony Taylor: Alright. But

111
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:33.290
Anthony Taylor: when we say categorize, we can say past faith, true, false

112
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:34.780
Anthony Taylor: car truck.

113
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay, yes, no.

114
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.770
Anthony Taylor: It's still the category.

115
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:49.110
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So qualified loan applicant versus an unqualified loan applicant.

116
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:54.820
Anthony Taylor: All of these are categories, even this one and 0,

117
00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:59.290
Anthony Taylor: the one and 0 have no mathematical value

118
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.439
Anthony Taylor: in this example.

119
00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:07.469
Anthony Taylor: It is a label kind of like. actually. See! Who's been paying attention?

120
00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.610
Anthony Taylor: What's another number?

121
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.640
Anthony Taylor: That is also a label? Yes, Meredith.

122
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:15.800
Meredith McCanse (she/her): age

123
00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.630
Anthony Taylor: age.

124
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:29.140
Anthony Taylor: It is a hundred percent. while it can be a continuous variable because everyone's age goes up. It is considered a label. There's no mathematical value to age.

125
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.509
Anthony Taylor: Alright, it's a classification.

126
00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.939
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So the 2 models we're gonna learn today are logistic regression

127
00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:41.890
Anthony Taylor: and support vector machines.

128
00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:47.409
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna get into some other ones over the coming days K. Nearest neighbor.

129
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:56.510
Anthony Taylor: Alright, I know that every time I see that I think K. Means it's not K we're gonna do decision trees.

130
00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:01.250
Anthony Taylor: And you're gonna love this. We're gonna do Random Forest.

131
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:06.460
Anthony Taylor: So I'm going to give you all a hint right now. what's a forest made up of

132
00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:10.410
Anthony Taylor: a bunch of

133
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:15.110
Masarirambi, Rodney: trees.

134
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:16.940
Anthony Taylor: See how that works?

135
00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:22.810
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we're gonna get to that. That'll make it easier member. And I love Randy Forest so much fun.

136
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:26.320
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So let's look at more, some more. Oh, wait. I actually think this is

137
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:35.610
Anthony Taylor: okay. is this it? It's kind of an interesting thing, the way they're doing this.

138
00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.070
Anthony Taylor: they actually have, like an instructor do. That's

139
00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.709
Anthony Taylor: with the slides.

140
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:56.660
Anthony Taylor: I'm just gonna like, talk about the site. It's kind of different. But anyway, so classification models bottom line is, they give us a probability that a particular label is, let's just go with A or B,

141
00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:01.349
Anthony Taylor: all right, binary, A or B one or 0.

142
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:05.460
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so they give us a probability

143
00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:09.580
Anthony Taylor: of of that. It is either A or it is B,

144
00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:11.190
Anthony Taylor: and that's it.

145
00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:23.670
Anthony Taylor: Now that probability will be like if the number and and we can actually set this cut off. But let's just assume by default. The cut off is going to be 50%. So point 5 0.

146
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.540
Anthony Taylor: So if it's point 4 8,

147
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.310
Anthony Taylor: it's the lower one, A,

148
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:35.399
Anthony Taylor: if it's point 5 1, it's B not a lot of confidence is

149
00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:40.329
Anthony Taylor: okay. If it was point 9 8 and B, you'd be like, that's B,

150
00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.930
Anthony Taylor: it is point 0 one. That's definitely a

151
00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:53.349
Anthony Taylor: but the way logistic regression works is, it gives us a probability. We set the threshold.

152
00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:58.259
Anthony Taylor: So through data analytics, you're going to say, Okay, well.

153
00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:08.920
Anthony Taylor: you know, from 50 to 60% here point 5 to point 7. Those are sometimes a. in fact, they're a more often than their B,

154
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:17.019
Anthony Taylor: so you can actually raise that threshold to say, Okay, everything below point 70 s. And A,

155
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.300
Anthony Taylor: and above is a P.

156
00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:26.269
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So these are ways that we tune the models. Remember when I told you about models.

157
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.080
Anthony Taylor: it's all about truth.

158
00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:29.960
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

159
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:36.669
Anthony Taylor: Imagine what builds supervisory model for a bank. It can determine whether to approve or disapprove.

160
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:47.909
Clayton Graves: Is there an option? Is there an optimal threshold, or a way to determine an option? 100%? Yes, there's a way to determine it by default? It will almost always start at 50.

161
00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:50.220
Anthony Taylor: So point 5,

162
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:51.490
okay.

163
00:14:51.810 --> 00:15:03.950
Anthony Taylor:  so we have data about the 2 groups of startups, healthy and unhealthy firms. Okay, now, here's the problem with this date. You guys think this data is going to be hard, classify?

164
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:10.490
Anthony Taylor: Absolutely not. Right? It is about as clear as you get.

165
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:15.650
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so don't be surprised if we're very successful

166
00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.720
Anthony Taylor: at classifying this data.

167
00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.000
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So

168
00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:31.830
Anthony Taylor: classification models have allowed finances and become more proactive. Supervised learning and algorithms can predict outcomes with a high degree of accuracy which allows for more effective

169
00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:36.690
Anthony Taylor: an efficient mitigation. So there are. yeah.

170
00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.650
Anthony Taylor: interestingly enough.

171
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.520
Anthony Taylor: I want you to think about

172
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:58.070
Anthony Taylor: this curve. This is a logistic regression curve that we're going to use to predict. Okay, if you are above this line. you're this. If you're below this line. You're this pretty much. That's the basis.

173
00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:02.070
Anthony Taylor: Go back to this date. So

174
00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.630
Anthony Taylor: of these, 1, 2, 3, 4 images

175
00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:13.389
Anthony Taylor: which one do you think logistic regression would be best at finding a prediction.

176
00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:26.309
Anthony Taylor: This first one here. Right? Absolute. Okay? Why? Because it's got a linear. It's got a nice, easy, linear pattern.

177
00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.500
Anthony Taylor: So this is going to do very well.

178
00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.769
Anthony Taylor: This guy. Better wait.

179
00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:38.500
Anthony Taylor: District Regression couldn't do it. If you begged it to this one it might come out. Okay, but probably not great.

180
00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:44.290
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this one logistic regression can't do at all. But you know, why.

181
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:49.879
Anthony Taylor: Think I've alluded to it. But I'm not sure. So let's see if just anybody knows and guess

182
00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.210
Anthony Taylor: scurry.

183
00:16:53.930 --> 00:17:02.749
Anthony Taylor: is it because there's 3 groups of data? Not 2. Yes, it is. Logistic. Regression is a binary model

184
00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.000
Anthony Taylor: can only give 0 or what?

185
00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:11.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it can't give 3 variables. So even if it could fit this.

186
00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:16.269
Anthony Taylor: they would only fit 2. Okay, so good? Answer.

187
00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:18.760
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

188
00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:35.090
Anthony Taylor: so this is an interesting one. II get it. It's kind of a weird statement, though, but binary models. With multiclass. So, in other words, you can technically do a binary model with multiclasses.

189
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:43.650
Anthony Taylor: And the way it does it. it it basically. So this is how it would work. I have

190
00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.989
Anthony Taylor: cat dog fish fur.

191
00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:53.239
Anthony Taylor: Okay. what I can do with a binary model is, say. it's birth

192
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:58.830
Anthony Taylor: that's binary.

193
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:02.759
Anthony Taylor: Is it a bird? Yeah or no.

194
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:12.580
Anthony Taylor: but by saying it's a bird in a multi-classification scenario, I've basically stated it's not a cat dog fish.

195
00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:26.159
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So that's why they put these in this little array like this. you're basically only predicting this side of this statement versus this site.

196
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:32.900
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Well, normally, this is what you're gonna see with binary classification.

197
00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:37.650
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna say, it's a bird, not a cat bird, not a dog. It's a bird, not a fish.

198
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:42.139
Anthony Taylor: What's the difference? How you prep your data?

199
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.670
Anthony Taylor: That's it. This is way cleaner.

200
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:57.750
Anthony Taylor: Usually we will avoid this or use different modes. There's no reason, I mean. so I I'm gonna say, this, this isn't in the the

201
00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:04.659
Anthony Taylor: this stuff. Okay, logistic regression is kind of the center of the universe for machine learning.

202
00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.550
Anthony Taylor: Ultimately.

203
00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:10.749
Anthony Taylor: most models. At some point

204
00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:19.599
Anthony Taylor: we'll do a logistic regression. Even the really big ones like tensorflow. You know, deep learning models, stuff like that

205
00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:24.929
Anthony Taylor: are doing logistic regression. They're just doing it, you know, a million times

206
00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:27.129
Anthony Taylor: per piece of data.

207
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:33.970
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's all probabilities. And logistic regression is the fastest.

208
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:38.050
Anthony Taylor: most performant way to get that probability.

209
00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:50.960
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So you'll see it get used. I mean, like, under the covers. If you guys were to dig in underneath, you would see logistic regression is used a lot. Will you use stick regression a lot.

210
00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:55.499
Anthony Taylor: If it's binary, try it because it's the fastest.

211
00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.280
Anthony Taylor: right? If it's not binary.

212
00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:03.180
Anthony Taylor: Well, you can't use it any. so move on to the next best.

213
00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:04.970
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

214
00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:09.290
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now we have an example.

215
00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:16.810
Anthony Taylor: So we're just gonna import pandas.

216
00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:20.599
Anthony Taylor: Nothing new there. I'm going to bring in some data.

217
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:27.420
Anthony Taylor: We'll plot it out. See what it looks like. Now, it's very nice of them. They gave us data that is so cleanly cut.

218
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:32.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so this is gonna this is gonna model really hot.

219
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:42.209
Anthony Taylor: because there's like almost no chance. Our model won't be the class buttons. This is not typical data.

220
00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:46.020
Anthony Taylor:  so there's the top of it.

221
00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:55.210
Anthony Taylor: We have our category. So we know what the categories are. 0 or what? Let's do. Our value counts

222
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.729
Anthony Taylor: a lot more zeros than we have ones. Yeah, I can see that.

223
00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:01.620
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

224
00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:05.829
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna split train test split. Just like we did

225
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.049
Anthony Taylor: all last week. Okay,

226
00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.739
Anthony Taylor: we're going to

227
00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:17.489
Anthony Taylor: create a copy of the data frame and then drop our label

228
00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:22.799
Anthony Taylor: so that we just have our features in X, just like we've done before.

229
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.730
Anthony Taylor: And we're going to take our label and put it into Y,

230
00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.260
Anthony Taylor: everybody clear with that.

231
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:32.949
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Then we'll do train test, split

232
00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.779
Anthony Taylor: nothing new here. Everything is exactly the same as what we did last week.

233
00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:46.599
Anthony Taylor: This is what our trained data looks like, hey? What they want you to see here to 993 rows

234
00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.400
Anthony Taylor: versus.

235
00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.579
We didn't show it there, but we could see here

236
00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:56.260
Anthony Taylor: we have actually what? Well, about 13 of

237
00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.130
Anthony Taylor: and 20.

238
00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:06.580
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so it took 993 rows. Put those in the training data set alright. Now, we can do logistic regression.

239
00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:11.419
Anthony Taylor:  just like everything before

240
00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:13.729
Anthony Taylor: we're going to import the model

241
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:22.430
Anthony Taylor: instantiate the model. Nothing new. We're going to fit the model to our training data.

242
00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:32.589
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to score our model. So we're going to score it on extrem, and we're going to score it on extest test contest.

243
00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:42.040
Anthony Taylor: Now, I've told you guys numerous times. You can over fit them all.

244
00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:49.379
Anthony Taylor: Okay, is this over fit? Does this fit? How I describe to you an overfit mode?

245
00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:55.270
Meredith McCanse (she/her): No.

246
00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:58.569
Anthony Taylor: thank you, Meredith. I see a lot of people nodding.

247
00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:13.799
Anthony Taylor: because if it were over fit, it would perform well in training, but not in testing. But this performed well in both. Right? So this is probably okay. But when you look at the original data. It's like I said, got.

248
00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:18.570
Anthony Taylor: how could it screw this up right? There's like, literally no overlap.

249
00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:23.839
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you could ask a kid to bring a crayon, and they could they could predict this model.

250
00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:29.380
Anthony Taylor: Alright, I mean, there's nothing to it. But yeah. So just one more reminder.

251
00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:31.710
Anthony Taylor: If your training score is high

252
00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:37.060
Anthony Taylor: and your testing score is low. You have probably over fit your mom

253
00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.960
Anthony Taylor: alright. You'll get to see more of that later.

254
00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:43.050
Anthony Taylor: I promise. Okay, if anyone's unclear.

255
00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:51.810
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So now that we've scored, we can go ahead and do our prediction. And this is again, just like we did in our regression.

256
00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.449
Anthony Taylor: We're going to predict it.

257
00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.690
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna basically create a data frame

258
00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:07.820
Anthony Taylor: with our prediction in our actual. So this is what we we know. It's going to be perfect. And then we're just going to take it and append it to

259
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:13.640
Anthony Taylor: well, what are they doing here? This is their testing. There's the we're predicting on X test.

260
00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:20.049
Anthony Taylor: saving both of them. So it's like the same thing we just did up above. but with a cool little print.

261
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:33.090
Anthony Taylor: Oh, I see, we created a data frame of that. So now you can see that. And now we can do an accuracy score that's new on the models test data set.

262
00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:41.160
Anthony Taylor: We already knew it was one. All accuracy scores doing is going set. Yep, Seth sings that

263
00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:42.160
Anthony Taylor: Yup.

264
00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:47.729
Anthony Taylor: It's basically telling us what percentage of the records.

265
00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:54.940
Anthony Taylor: the prediction that matches the actual. That's the accuracy score. Okay?

266
00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:56.910
Anthony Taylor: I have a question.

267
00:24:57.050 --> 00:25:00.110
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yes. Can an accuracy score?

268
00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:03.609
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Could that can you use that just for any 2

269
00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:08.719
Meredith McCanse (she/her): numeric data just compares them? Or

270
00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.630
Anthony Taylor: does it have to be used in the text?

271
00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:15.710
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Right? Yeah.

272
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:24.550
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. I mean the the idea the accuracy score is is to provide a metric on your machine learning. Well, but I mean.

273
00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:31.580
Anthony Taylor: I don't see any reason why you couldn't take any 2 columns and say, Give me an accuracy.

274
00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:34.759
Anthony Taylor: It's probably overkill that I think you could do.

275
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:41.770
Anthony Taylor: Why not? Yeah. there's no reason why it could. Hi so

276
00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:44.830
Anthony Taylor: first acted.

277
00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:51.770
Anthony Taylor: You gotta prep some data, split it model, fit it to logistic regression. Predict the testing labels, calculate the metrics

278
00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:57.089
Anthony Taylor: and then they give you like more defined instructions.

279
00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:01.710
Anthony Taylor: Let's take a look at what they give you. Here. They give you the data

280
00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:06.089
Anthony Taylor: yeah. And then they want you to do all this fun stuff.

281
00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:10.760
Anthony Taylor: So for this, I'm gonna give. Yeah, the 15.

282
00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.540
Anthony Taylor: Oh, wait.

283
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.990
Anthony Taylor: Oh, wait! No, no! Hold on.

284
00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:27.649
Anthony Taylor: Okay, actually, this is the activity I was talking about.

285
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:29.890
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

286
00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:37.309
Anthony Taylor: I'm actually going to go to slideshow for this bam and never go to slideshow.

287
00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:42.849
Anthony Taylor: So this is activity. This isn't everyone, do. We're all going to do this together.

288
00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:46.310
Anthony Taylor: Okay, pay attention.

289
00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:52.200
Anthony Taylor: Filtering spam messages out of email in boxes.

290
00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:57.230
Anthony Taylor: Alright, have we defined one multi classes? Yet? We have have we

291
00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:00.240
Anthony Taylor: multi-class? Just means you're you're you're

292
00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:02.850
Anthony Taylor: trying to solve for more than 2.

293
00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.190
Anthony Taylor: So cat, dog, bird, multi-class.

294
00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:10.160
Anthony Taylor: Okay, orange, banana, peach, multi-class

295
00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:12.620
Anthony Taylor: got it bye.

296
00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:17.469
Anthony Taylor: So with filtering spam messages out of an email inbox, be binary

297
00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.230
Anthony Taylor: or multi-class.

298
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:27.890
Anthony Taylor: Who wants to risk it and take a guess. Oh, Matt, this is binary.

299
00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.549
Anthony Taylor: Matt Clayton. Both say binaries. Everybody agree.

300
00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:37.780
Anthony Taylor: Nobody wants to disagree. Okay? Why is it binary? What are the 2 binaries?

301
00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:40.400
Dipinto, Matt: Spam? Not spam?

302
00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:43.370
Anthony Taylor: Yes, no, that is exactly right, spam

303
00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.899
Anthony Taylor: or not spam binary model

304
00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:52.570
Masarirambi, Rodney: predicting whether an image is a category just going back a map.

305
00:27:54.560 --> 00:28:10.740
Masarirambi, Rodney: So this is just in this context of here, because if you're gonna be using like AI to read those messages to see if it's gonna be spam and stuff right? And now we'll tell my multi class, right? Or we still still just binary, because

306
00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:17.800
Anthony Taylor: keeping in mind, it's and and what we would use for this is called natural language processing, which you guys are gonna learn after project 2

307
00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:24.469
Anthony Taylor: but basically, it's going to look for patterns that usually indicate spam

308
00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:29.369
Anthony Taylor: and and then drop it there. But it is. It's just yep, or Nope.

309
00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:36.010
Anthony Taylor: Yes, it's spam or no, it's not alright. Image is a category.

310
00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:44.209
Anthony Taylor: This is tricky. Somebody else want to answer. Natalie. What do you think

311
00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:54.239
Mason, Natalie: I was just typing that they need to update that spam filter because mine's not working very well.

312
00:28:54.360 --> 00:29:00.940
Mason, Natalie: But what is predicting with it? I mean, there's a cat or a dog

313
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:07.749
Mason, Natalie: it's gonna be binary. But it could be multi class if we're talking about different separating different breeds.

314
00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:19.130
Anthony Taylor: see? And that's the tricky part, right? If we went into, you know, like different variations of cat or dog, I agree. But it's pretty much, says Cat.

315
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:24.089
Anthony Taylor: No, not Siamese cat or Maltese.

316
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:26.230
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

317
00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.129
Anthony Taylor: Oh, that's weird.

318
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:30.350
Anthony Taylor: There we go. binary.

319
00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:34.559
Anthony Taylor: Okay, predicting whether an image is a cat, dog, bird, or fish.

320
00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.100
Clayton Graves: Who wants this one

321
00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:40.250
Raugewitz, Tania: multi-class.

322
00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.370
Anthony Taylor: Everybody agree with multiclass.

323
00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.379
Anthony Taylor: Alright, I would say.

324
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:51.530
Anthony Taylor: oh, multi classes, correct nice work.

325
00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.969
Anthony Taylor: classifying custom, views on social media

326
00:29:56.030 --> 00:30:00.290
Anthony Taylor: as positive or negative. Who wants that

327
00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:04.900
Raugewitz, Tania: bye, Eric.

328
00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:07.180
Masarirambi, Rodney: bye, Mary.

329
00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:11.769
Anthony Taylor: so and the 2 binaries would be is positive or

330
00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:12.950
Anthony Taylor: is negative.

331
00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:21.869
Anthony Taylor: That's so nice. This is like the first interactive slide show. I think we've ever had. It's pretty exciting.

332
00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:28.639
Clayton Graves: So that means those God apple surveys are multi-flash.

333
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:37.950
Anthony Taylor: The surveys surveys are looking at key performance indicators, and trust me. There is no intelligence behind.

334
00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:41.310
Anthony Taylor:  yeah.

335
00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:47.309
Anthony Taylor: they just they. They love to put those out there, and I go take a look at them every week, and

336
00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:55.180
Anthony Taylor: they're exciting. They're exciting. The one I hate is that the homework comments falls on my

337
00:30:55.530 --> 00:31:02.949
Anthony Taylor: Kpis really bugs me. But identifying individual letters from handwritten text.

338
00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:05.120
Anthony Taylor: That's an interesting one.

339
00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:08.580
Clayton Graves: What do you guys think that's multi-class?

340
00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:19.829
Dipinto, Matt: Anybody disagree and might take binary? It's either a letter or not letter. So if you have a gap between letters. That's your false section, and then it moves to the next one.

341
00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:24.099
Anthony Taylor: just guessing, not really arguing with them. Logic.

342
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:27.530
Clayton Graves: that's valid. Yeah. But I still say multiplies

343
00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:31.290
Anthony Taylor: way to stick to your guns, clay. What do you think, Meredith?

344
00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:42.120
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Could it be set up where it's something like it goes through every letter, and is like, is this an a yes or no? Is this an A, and then is this a B, yes or no, like I don't know that seems

345
00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:44.910
Meredith McCanse (she/her): it a little ridiculous. But

346
00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:48.430
Raugewitz, Tania: if it were set up that way it would be binary. Echo binary.

347
00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:53.030
Dipinto, Matt: Yeah. The actual Ocr is definitely multi-class.

348
00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:57.049
Dipinto, Matt: but they do some magic in the front end to break the letters apart.

349
00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:02.409
Anthony Taylor: Well, and that's accurate.

350
00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:08.679
Anthony Taylor: So I got some good news for you guys. We'll learn how to do this, not today. In a couple of weeks.

351
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:14.910
Anthony Taylor: We actually do this this particular thing. It is very much multi class.

352
00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:22.530
Anthony Taylor: The reason being is, if it's identifying a letter it has to be able to identify. Let's just stick with letters.

353
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:28.819
Anthony Taylor: 26 different letters. but technically 52, because it's uppercase and lower case.

354
00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:35.249
Anthony Taylor: So that makes it multi-class. II I'm not gonna say that what you stated is wrong.

355
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:41.560
Anthony Taylor: You could say, well, if we're just saying it's a letter. then that's fine. But

356
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:46.579
Anthony Taylor: in this case it says, identify. Well, doesn't you know

357
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:50.779
Anthony Taylor: what it means is is it's an odd. not it's a letter.

358
00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:56.249
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, so that's a good answer. I like that. I like to discuss them.

359
00:32:56.570 --> 00:33:00.950
Masarirambi, Rodney: But with that, but with that, wouldn't it lean more to.

360
00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:02.160
Masarirambi, Rodney: because

361
00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.899
Masarirambi, Rodney: uppercase and lowercase aren't really 2 different

362
00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:11.640
Masarirambi, Rodney: like types of letters. It's doing just being a letter.

363
00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:27.499
Anthony Taylor: Not only are they different, you know, Ascii codes, they're different. And the way they're written. So I will tell you when we guys, when we get to this, it's literally going to take every bit

364
00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.260
Anthony Taylor: in this image.

365
00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:35.889
Anthony Taylor: Calculate the math on that bit, and then try to identify whether it's a letter or not.

366
00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:51.589
Clayton Graves: And what letter it is actually read anything. It's simply taking the picture apart. You have to think about it like this, Rodney. If you type a capital M and word, and a lowercase and M and word, there are 2 different characters.

367
00:33:52.800 --> 00:34:10.949
Masarirambi, Rodney: Yeah, right? Right? Right? Right? Yeah. The the bit where it was like, oh, the, that is the computers perspective. I mean the best examples would be like.

368
00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:16.429
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. Q. Right. Capital. Q. And a lowercase. Q. Don't look anything along

369
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:21.909
Anthony Taylor: right so. And a. Also.

370
00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:26.030
Anthony Taylor: you know, like anything like an A or B, yeah, there's a few

371
00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:27.569
Raugewitz, Tania: DE,

372
00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:28.810
Anthony Taylor: that's a tough one.

373
00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:33.990
Anthony Taylor: I got that. Okay, let's go category ecommerce products

374
00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:37.389
Anthony Taylor: as furniture, kitchen or outdoor items.

375
00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:43.450
Anthony Taylor: This one feels too easy after the letter went.

376
00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:48.900
Anthony Taylor: Anybody want it, Cindy? I haven't heard from you.

377
00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:55.459
Sihong Zhou: She always looks so surprised when I called. I think it is multi class.

378
00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:58.879
Anthony Taylor: It is multi class. Thank you for answering.

379
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:07.440
Anthony Taylor: predicting whether a customer will churn or not.

380
00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.540
Anthony Taylor: Hmm.

381
00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:13.329
Anthony Taylor: wait, Christine, you're my marketing person

382
00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:17.060
Kanouff, Christine: binary

383
00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:27.240
Anthony Taylor: absolutely, and it kind of gives it to you because it has that or right middle of only 2 things right? They don't know, or like that. That or the

384
00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:32.359
Anthony Taylor: but yes, absolutely binary. It's gonna leave, or it's not

385
00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:34.830
Anthony Taylor: okay

386
00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:41.340
Anthony Taylor: predicting whether a credit card transactions are fraud or not.

387
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.320
Anthony Taylor: This is the last one.

388
00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:44.720
michael mcpherson: Hi, there!

389
00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:52.110
Anthony Taylor: By Mary, thank you. Mike Binary is correct. It's either fraud or ain't oops.

390
00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:58.450
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Alright. So any questions about any of those anybody got another skill? They want to ask about

391
00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:59.910
Anthony Taylor: anything like that.

392
00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:09.239
Anthony Taylor:  yeah, I mean, I go where their questions are silly. Okay?

393
00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.620
Anthony Taylor: So

394
00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:14.669
Anthony Taylor: we actually already did this demo. So we are on.

395
00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:19.590
Anthony Taylor: Oh, actually, though, I still like the slide show. So you guys saw

396
00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:22.389
Anthony Taylor: that we had those 2 blobs of data.

397
00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:29.509
Anthony Taylor: And I applied a logistic regression model. So in the background, the logistic regression model is

398
00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:38.270
Anthony Taylor: basically creating a line like this between the data points. And at some point.

399
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:45.879
Anthony Taylor: it's going to say. And again, in this case, at point 5, if the.is anywhere up here.

400
00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:48.590
Anthony Taylor: it's good.

401
00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:52.650
Anthony Taylor: If it's down here. it's bad.

402
00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:58.969
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so that is the goal. Get it? Before or above that.

403
00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:03.790
Anthony Taylor: Alright. And that means anything on this whole thing. So query.

404
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:05.500
Anthony Taylor: okay.

405
00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:13.210
Anthony Taylor: so. And here you can see if the data was perfectly along the line exactly where that comes into play.

406
00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:19.019
Anthony Taylor: And that's how logistic regression works. It's literally that simple

407
00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:26.219
Anthony Taylor: it's we're using the sigmoid function, which is what makes this cool line believe. That's what they call that line? Right? Jeff

408
00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:27.519
Anthony Taylor: sigmoid line.

409
00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:34.860
Clayton Graves: How does logistic regression handle? Let's say something was at 50%.

410
00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:48.520
Anthony Taylor: How how would it at 50? So look what it says, less than 50 greater than 50? Right. If it's at 50, it's just going to give it. It's just gonna pick one. And usually I think we can. I think that's a tuning variable.

411
00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:56.999
Anthony Taylor: But I believe to be honest with you. I'm like 99% sure that it's greater than or equal to 50 is considered positive.

412
00:37:57.570 --> 00:38:01.880
Anthony Taylor: I like I think this is just a typo on this slide. But yeah.

413
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:05.190
Anthony Taylor: but that's a good question. I like the question. You're thinking

414
00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:09.629
Anthony Taylor: alright. So probability good credit one over one plus e minus.

415
00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:15.739
Anthony Taylor: So behind the scenes, it converts continuous data to a percentage probability

416
00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:22.250
Anthony Taylor: of being good credit or good. Borrow. Okay.

417
00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:26.129
Anthony Taylor:  And and that's what we're talking about.

418
00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:29.290
Anthony Taylor: This probability from 0 to what

419
00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:35.160
Anthony Taylor: (607) 080-9000.

420
00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:40.910
Anthony Taylor: Okay? If you looked at now, I will tell you the model that we're going to the the

421
00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:44.120
Anthony Taylor: the code I'm going to show you is going to tell you 0 or what.

422
00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:48.430
Anthony Taylor: But there is a way to get what probabilities it determine.

423
00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:56.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay, there is a property of your model that will tell you what the actual probability was.

424
00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:00.310
Anthony Taylor: Alright kind of interesting.

425
00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:04.209
Anthony Taylor: And again, this line is tunable.

426
00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:15.360
Anthony Taylor: which just means I can change this line to a different cutoff up or down. which, when you think about it, makes perfect sense.

427
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:17.690
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

428
00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:22.609
Anthony Taylor: a sigmoid function. That's how we translate.

429
00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:27.070
Anthony Taylor: So again, free process, this is our train test split deal with

430
00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:29.089
Anthony Taylor: missing values, with

431
00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:38.100
Anthony Taylor: how one hot and coding training. That's our fit validate. This is basically our score predict. That's what we did at the bottom. We made the data.

432
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:41.380
Anthony Taylor: Okay. now, we're attracted.

433
00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.790
Anthony Taylor: Sorry about that Whoopsie.

434
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:46.330
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

435
00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:52.370
Anthony Taylor: so yeah, so this is activity you're gonna do. And you have.

436
00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.709
Anthony Taylor: I'm almost there, I promise.

437
00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:04.749
Anthony Taylor: holy Moly. That was a long lecture. Huh?

438
00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:06.780
Anthony Taylor: There it is 15 min.

439
00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.379
Anthony Taylor: So let's get the room.

440
00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:14.820
Anthony Taylor: How to go was that fairly easy?

441
00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:17.090
Clayton Graves: Put it on. We try to keep it that way.

442
00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:18.649
Anthony Taylor: What, Clayton.

443
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.510
Clayton Graves: Bertie, darn good!

444
00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:26.530
Anthony Taylor: I love that. Did you guys notice where the data set came from?

445
00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:35.380
Anthony Taylor: Uci. where I used to teach data science?

446
00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:41.519
Anthony Taylor: I might be teaching data science there again after this class, I'm not sure

447
00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:43.580
Anthony Taylor: we'll see.

448
00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:46.839
Clayton Graves: Have we burned you out on AI?

449
00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:52.130
Anthony Taylor: Not you guys. You guys have been pretty freakin terrific. But

450
00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:55.210
Anthony Taylor: I think I would rather teach data science.

451
00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:56.670
Anthony Taylor: and we'll see.

452
00:40:57.090 --> 00:41:05.349
Anthony Taylor:  let's do it. So we import pandas. You guys got that for free this one, too.

453
00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:15.420
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're gonna do a value count on results for you. And look at that. That's super nicely even split. What a nice clean dataset. They get

454
00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:19.419
Anthony Taylor: alright. We're gonna create our label data and

455
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:21.800
Anthony Taylor: our at our feature data.

456
00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:33.659
Anthony Taylor: Do our train test split? Do a logistic regression model note, they did add some other stuff in here. logistic regression. To to sum this up.

457
00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:50.229
Anthony Taylor: when you train a logistic regression model, sometimes you have to put a Max. Because if you don't, it'll like go crazy. It'll just keep going forever and ever. Basically think of. You know, you guys remember what the the decimal equivalent of one third is

458
00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:56.290
Anthony Taylor: right. It's like that, 33, 3, 3, or whatever

459
00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:02.649
Anthony Taylor: till infinity, right point 3 3 or point 3. For like right?

460
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:11.220
Anthony Taylor: So basically, it kind of gets stuck in that kind of situation. So if you, if you don't put this sometimes you'll get an error.

461
00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:15.290
Anthony Taylor: or it'll whatever. So you can do that if that ever happens.

462
00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:20.050
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So we we created our model.

463
00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:25.310
Anthony Taylor: We trained our model and we scored our model. That

464
00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:26.980
Anthony Taylor: is a beautiful skull.

465
00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:30.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay, very, very good school.

466
00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:32.879
Anthony Taylor: We can look at our labels

467
00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:40.830
Anthony Taylor: on our accuracy score. And it was also very. It was

468
00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:43.420
Anthony Taylor: exactly the same. Look at that.

469
00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:54.520
Anthony Taylor: So how was this model produce? Fast malware looks extremely good. Approximately 96% of the apps in the test theory were accurately categorized by the model.

470
00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:56.790
Anthony Taylor: That's it. Okay?

471
00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:59.690
Anthony Taylor: Which means 4% of them

472
00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:12.099
Anthony Taylor: were inaccurately determined. It's funny. If you look at the data, it's like it's all 0. There's nothing there but there's 87 columns here, and you don't see a lot of them

473
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:15.820
Anthony Taylor: right here. By the way, do you guys know how to fix that.

474
00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:28.790
Anthony Taylor: No, I knew it was one of those it's trunk K equals.

475
00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:30.449
Anthony Taylor: I might have to look it up.

476
00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:35.379
Anthony Taylor: False is not so false, is right.

477
00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:38.999
Anthony Taylor: Come on. It's one of these, I promise.

478
00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:44.390
Anthony Taylor: I'm not turning on copilot. but I will open up Chat. Gp.

479
00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:57.320
Anthony Taylor: I don't like who Pilate. It's messy.

480
00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:00.430
Anthony Taylor: but it's a lot quicker.

481
00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.560
Anthony Taylor: Oh, my God!

482
00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:12.370
Anthony Taylor: Head truncate parameter. Yeah.

483
00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:15.970
Anthony Taylor: Oh.

484
00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:22.230
Anthony Taylor: there we go.

485
00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:25.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

486
00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:29.669
Anthony Taylor: so that's a spark thing, not a canvas thing.

487
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:38.370
Anthony Taylor: You guys will. I don't think you guys learn spark in this class. Maybe that'll be an extra review. You guys want to learn spark.

488
00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:41.729
Anthony Taylor: Does anybody know what spark is.

489
00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:44.830
Anthony Taylor: It's my favorite toy.

490
00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:48.059
michael mcpherson: What lights the fuel?

491
00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:57.490
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So now you can see you can see all 87 columns. That's all I was trying to do. There was show you a way to see all.

492
00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:01.350
Anthony Taylor: Okay, there's a lot of, and they're almost all 0 work.

493
00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:12.089
Anthony Taylor: Okay, where are we? Can I ask a real quick question, is there you were just talking about?

494
00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:14.050
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Sorry. Hold on 1 s.

495
00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:16.069
Anthony Taylor: Bless you!

496
00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:31.020
Meredith McCanse (she/her):  you were just talking about it. 96% correct. So there's 4% that are not correct. Is there any sort of function that will deliver to you the results that are were considered

497
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:32.630
Meredith McCanse (she/her): not correct.

498
00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:44.379
Anthony Taylor: Well, yeah, you could certainly like where you did. We do it here? Testing predictions. like, in the example we do here.

499
00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:50.640
Anthony Taylor: where we created the data frame with the actual versus the predicted, you would just

500
00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:53.119
Anthony Taylor: say, Show me the ones that weren't.

501
00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:59.030
Anthony Taylor: That's it. So you would just filter where this is not equal to this.

502
00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:02.590
Anthony Taylor: And then, is there a specific method?

503
00:46:02.830 --> 00:46:06.450
Anthony Taylor: Maybe probably somewhere? I don't know.

504
00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:09.950
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Cool, thank you. But that's a good question. I like question.

505
00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:15.900
Anthony Taylor: I like good questions. Well, it can't possibly be break already.

506
00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:35.029
Masarirambi, Rodney: The 2 things I'm gonna take from this class is that the break comes at surprising times, and that all data that we will deal with in the real world is gonna be nice and clean, and it's just gonna give us yes or no answers, and we'll be fantastic.

507
00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.169
Anthony Taylor: Exactly. That is the point

508
00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.630
Clayton Graves: perfectly put.

509
00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:46.140
Anthony Taylor: But that's why you have projects and challenges, because those are perfectly clean and nice.

510
00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:54.730
Anthony Taylor: We have to show you how to do it. If everything was complicated, then you guys would complain that, hey? It's too fast and it's too complicated.

511
00:46:55.430 --> 00:47:02.150
Masarirambi, Rodney: We're gonna we're gonna we're gonna regardless. We're gonna complain about.

512
00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:13.810
Anthony Taylor: I tell you what, II think it's a little early for break. So I'm gonna do the next lecture, and then. before the activity will do break, how's that? So? Okay.

513
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:16.510
Anthony Taylor: so we're going to talk about.

514
00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:20.370
Anthony Taylor: And I love this. This is not something you need. It depends for

515
00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:24.270
Anthony Taylor: data leakage

516
00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:30.459
Anthony Taylor: and pre-process. II can always count on Natalie to smile at my bad jokes.

517
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:34.740
Anthony Taylor: I appreciate that, Natalie. You're going to do well on a cruise ship.

518
00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:37.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So

519
00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:46.220
Anthony Taylor: good. Data League pre-processing revisited. So you remember how we did

520
00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:49.469
Anthony Taylor: the other day when we did standard scale.

521
00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:58.380
Anthony Taylor: Okay, all of our data looks something like this. We run it through scale data. Notice, these ranges are like between a thousand, 1,500,

522
00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:04.929
Anthony Taylor: 2,200. 4,500. But then we run standard scalar. And it's basically all between negative 2 and 2.

523
00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:08.929
Anthony Taylor: Okay, same values. We've just changed

524
00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:13.930
Anthony Taylor: how they look and how the model sees it. The the idea behind that

525
00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:17.890
Anthony Taylor: is so that no value. Oh, yeah, Matt.

526
00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:24.630
Dipinto, Matt: just a question on the scalars and the action they take makes perfect sense is in this image well, but

527
00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:32.059
Dipinto, Matt: it scales to what feels like an arbitrary value like, why is it 2? And why is it?

528
00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:33.269
Dipinto, Matt: Is it?

529
00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:40.139
Anthony Taylor: Yeah? Well, I mean, like the range. It's like.

530
00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:42.370
Anthony Taylor: yeah, okay, the range is consistent.

531
00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:44.860
Anthony Taylor: The the

532
00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:52.559
Anthony Taylor: yeah, I mean, the range is always consistent with them, and as long as have it remains consistent, you're usually gonna be fine

533
00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:55.530
Anthony Taylor: right now, am I going to say it's always negative one to one

534
00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:59.209
Anthony Taylor: most of the models that I it's a negative one to what?

535
00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:09.389
Anthony Taylor: But there's other ones. There's like a min Max Scalar right? And what min. Max Galer does, and this is another variation is, it takes the lowest number

536
00:49:09.810 --> 00:49:15.639
Anthony Taylor: and the biggest number. and then it scales all the values in between those numbers

537
00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:27.780
Anthony Taylor: to match the other other and it's between like 0 and one. So it says, the lowest number is, we're gonna make that 0. So the lowest number in this case is like a thousand.

538
00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:32.950
Clayton Graves: Right? Where is the scale? Data? Hmm.

539
00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:42.489
Clayton Graves: it looks weird. It looks like there's there's dots that are just off of the the upper range. There.

540
00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:44.709
Clayton Graves: you see that?

541
00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:49.909
Dipinto, Matt: Yeah. Well, yeah, it looks like it's like a high. It's just because the chart is kind of

542
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:53.369
Anthony Taylor: yeah, it's just that they should have added like another

543
00:49:53.970 --> 00:50:03.249
Anthony Taylor: point one, so that you could see the whole dot. But it's fine same thing on this one. This is a bad, badly designed chart, which you guys know how to do better.

544
00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:06.610
Anthony Taylor: But anyway, long story short.

545
00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:12.980
Anthony Taylor: as long as you apply. So the the bottom line is as long as you apply the same method

546
00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:19.790
Anthony Taylor: on. And and what you're about to find on the test, the train and incoming data.

547
00:50:20.590 --> 00:50:22.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you'll be fine.

548
00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:34.419
Anthony Taylor: I mean, whether it says 2 to negative 2 or 10 to negative 10. As long as it's consistent you'll be fine and and like I said, Min, Max Taylor, I actually like Max Taylor

549
00:50:34.450 --> 00:50:36.170
Anthony Taylor: way easier to understand

550
00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:46.570
Anthony Taylor: cause like I said, all it does takes the lowest value assigns it to 0. The highest value assigns it to one, and then everything in between gets placed on that

551
00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:48.100
Anthony Taylor: between 0 and one.

552
00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:54.629
Anthony Taylor: So it's a really easy one to understand. This one's a little more complicated because it's around the meeting.

553
00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:56.849
Anthony Taylor: But it's still pretty good.

554
00:50:57.550 --> 00:50:58.400
Dipinto, Matt: Okay?

555
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.160
Anthony Taylor: Good question.

556
00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:12.700
Anthony Taylor:  yeah. I like this quote, I'm gonna read this right out a lesson plan. I like the way they stated this. So as you have learned developing and L models, we take great care to reduce the risk of bites.

557
00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:17.229
Anthony Taylor: This is not bias like ethics. We're gonna get to that later

558
00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:28.940
Anthony Taylor: as much as possible in models where there is a broad range of values between feature columns. The model will place greater importance on columns with larger values.

559
00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:34.430
Anthony Taylor: So you've all heard me say that before. and I like the way they put it. They stated it here.

560
00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:44.459
Anthony Taylor: In effect, this compromises the model's understanding of how features and classes are related, and the result is a model that can make poor and

561
00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:48.789
Anthony Taylor: biased predictions for a data set beyond the training data.

562
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:52.630
Anthony Taylor: This case bias means it's going to be bias towards the larger value.

563
00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:55.580
Anthony Taylor: And if those larger values.

564
00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:59.779
Anthony Taylor: whatever they represent, that's what the model is going to be biased towards.

565
00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:04.069
Clayton Graves: So that's like a Saturday Sunday thing where

566
00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:06.770
Clayton Graves: Saturday was 6, Sunday was 0.

567
00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:09.689
Clayton Graves: So the model plays, okay.

568
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:14.620
Anthony Taylor: so Saturday, would we could cause the model to be biased on Saturdays

569
00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:16.670
Anthony Taylor: versus Sundays.

570
00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:17.850
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

571
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:24.789
Anthony Taylor:  yeah. So so that's why we do it. And I like to repeat that, because

572
00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:30.490
Anthony Taylor: it's it's an important thing to understand why you need to do it. And why, also.

573
00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:34.039
Anthony Taylor: while, like that data set, we were looking at a second ago.

574
00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:38.820
Anthony Taylor: this crazy one, or what? Where? Where was it?

575
00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:46.259
Anthony Taylor: This guy with all the ones and zeroes. That's not it is.

576
00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:49.649
Anthony Taylor: Oh, I minimized it. That explains it.

577
00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:52.089
Anthony Taylor: Okay, with all the ones and zeros.

578
00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:57.819
Anthony Taylor: It doesn't make a lot of sense to scale this. It's all zeros and ones. But could you?

579
00:52:58.310 --> 00:52:59.180
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

580
00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:11.440
Anthony Taylor: Because it wouldn't hurt anything. I mean, it adds a little compute that you probably didn't need. but it wouldn't hurt anything to do. It is the point. Okay.

581
00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:13.659
Anthony Taylor: I close up.

582
00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:21.489
Anthony Taylor: I'm getting mixed up. So I didn't wanna get mixed up. Okay, alright.

583
00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:30.050
Anthony Taylor:  and then normalization. This is the one that takes us like in this case. Oh, no, this is the minx. Look at that. I literally just talked about this.

584
00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:33.390
Anthony Taylor: So here's the min, max one. Everything's between 0 and one

585
00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:38.020
Anthony Taylor: highest score gets assigned to one lowest score to 0, and it fits everything in between.

586
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:45.200
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, so that's another one.  the the paradigm is simple.

587
00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:46.599
Anthony Taylor: You will

588
00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:51.420
Anthony Taylor: fit now up until now, what did we use to to scale our data.

589
00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:58.669
Anthony Taylor: we use standard scalar. But then, what was the method in the standard scalar set? Does anybody remember

590
00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:05.160
Anthony Taylor: it started with fit ended where

591
00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:07.770
Anthony Taylor: transform.

592
00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:12.490
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so it fit underscore transform.

593
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:20.659
Anthony Taylor: So what it did is in a single method. It trained the scalar, which let's use Min Max as an example

594
00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:24.570
Anthony Taylor: when it trained it, it said, the the lowest number is 0,

595
00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:32.209
Anthony Taylor: the highest number is one. Come up with the math to make every one of these numbers between 0 and one.

596
00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:38.400
Anthony Taylor: So it came up with an algorithm. It trained an algorithm

597
00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:49.829
Anthony Taylor: to do this math for us. So that was the fit. the transform? Was it applying that math to all of the original dots

598
00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:55.870
Anthony Taylor: data points to put them in this position? Okay, with that being said.

599
00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:02.530
Anthony Taylor: there is this concept of data leakage.

600
00:55:05.250 --> 00:55:08.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay. data leakage.

601
00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:14.819
Anthony Taylor: it's basically having data

602
00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:22.200
Anthony Taylor: in your having a data point in your data that actually gives away the answer.

603
00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:29.159
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so here's an example you're testing for low readiness.

604
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:38.350
Anthony Taylor: Right? Is this company a good loan risk for a bad risk? Okay? However, in your data, you have loan status column.

605
00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:41.780
Anthony Taylor: Now, that's a problem.

606
00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:49.860
Anthony Taylor: because you're basically saying, Is it the good risk or bad risk? But you have a status status is going to be. They're either good or they're bad

607
00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:52.590
Anthony Taylor: or default, or

608
00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:57.680
Anthony Taylor: you know, whatever it's that it's on the load for that row of data

609
00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:03.729
Anthony Taylor: so effectively, you've given it a key field to answer the question with.

610
00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:19.439
Anthony Taylor: alright, that field becomes everything. But the reason we call this leakage is. if data was coming in, would it have a loan status.

611
00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:27.609
Anthony Taylor: So you've trained your model, you've deployed it to prod. There's no loan status in your production data coming in.

612
00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:34.329
Anthony Taylor: So now, the field that your model basically trained itself on no longer exists.

613
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:36.920
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

614
00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:49.449
Anthony Taylor: so number one, that's something you watch for. But another way to do this is to use the standard, or is to make sure that when you do your standardization

615
00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:53.680
Anthony Taylor: you grain your standard scalar.

616
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:57.840
Anthony Taylor: then fit it to your training data.

617
00:56:58.310 --> 00:57:02.429
Anthony Taylor: Sorry, then transform it, your your training data.

618
00:57:02.770 --> 00:57:12.099
Anthony Taylor: So you fit it. you transform it. And then you take the same transformation and apply it to your testing data.

619
00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:14.330
Anthony Taylor: Now

620
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:21.310
Anthony Taylor: to finalize all of that. Once we go to production and new data comes in.

621
00:57:22.170 --> 00:57:29.140
Anthony Taylor: you're also going to apply the same transformation to that incoming data.

622
00:57:30.090 --> 00:57:31.920
Anthony Taylor: So by doing this.

623
00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:38.960
Anthony Taylor: you it doesn't eliminate the problem with having the extra column, but it'll standard scale it down to 0.

624
00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:44.119
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Which would make it no longer part of the discussion

625
00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:50.110
Anthony Taylor: ideally. You just want to make sure you don't have columns in there that can answer the question.

626
00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:53.150
Anthony Taylor: And what's another way?

627
00:57:53.590 --> 00:58:03.670
Anthony Taylor: And we've done this already. I will tell you. We're going to come up with a better way later. But what's another way to find out if we have a single column or

628
00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:07.479
Anthony Taylor: couple columns that are carrying all of the weight of them all.

629
00:58:12.970 --> 00:58:14.000
Dipinto, Matt: Pca.

630
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:15.630
Anthony Taylor: There you go.

631
00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:19.419
Anthony Taylor: We studied that already. Pca. It tells us.

632
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:23.760
Anthony Taylor: You know what columns, how much weight they're carrying in our model.

633
00:58:23.810 --> 00:58:28.319
Anthony Taylor: So if you do it, and like one column has 90% of the weight of your model.

634
00:58:28.550 --> 00:58:37.510
Anthony Taylor: Well, you got a problem. You need to go. Look at that. Call me personally. That's how I would stop breathing. Okay. truthfully

635
00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:40.860
Anthony Taylor: in in in my history.

636
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:47.730
Anthony Taylor: I have run across this. I've never let a column get into my model that had that much weight.

637
00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:50.749
Anthony Taylor: so I can't say I've done it this way.

638
00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:54.270
Anthony Taylor: I mean, I do the analysis before I put the data in.

639
00:58:54.750 --> 00:59:07.429
Anthony Taylor: So what would you do? So it's a pre process. Sorry. What would you do? Would you just drop the column? Well, you want to know why, so like the loan status one was obvious, right? I mean loan status that that's like a dead give.

640
00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:13.640
Anthony Taylor: Their loan is in good standing good status. Then they're obviously good risk, because they already got a loan.

641
00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:28.520
Anthony Taylor: Okay? If they've already defaulted. They're clearly a bad risk cause they've already defaulted. So the you know what you would do is you would go look at that and see. Okay, well, if this is the whole thing, do I even need a model

642
00:59:28.810 --> 00:59:33.569
Anthony Taylor: number one? Right? If you can get the answer from a single column, you don't need a machine learning problem.

643
00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:36.589
Anthony Taylor: There's no pattern to find.

644
00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:45.659
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So you would. Basically, you would either figure out why it's so important. Maybe add it to the label, or maybe drop it complete.

645
00:59:46.170 --> 00:59:55.190
Anthony Taylor: Because again. we're trying to generalize, we want to see the pattern across all of the being. But in my loan status example.

646
00:59:55.210 --> 01:00:01.480
Anthony Taylor: You would really drop that because you would realize that. Wait. We're not going to get loan status on incoming data

647
01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:05.730
Anthony Taylor: because they don't have a loan yet. We're trying to decide if they're going to get a loan.

648
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:12.660
Anthony Taylor: If they have a loan status value, then we would have to assume they got one. So therefore there are good risks.

649
01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:18.119
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's not my favorite example. But that is what data leakage is.

650
01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:20.950
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

651
01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:22.850
Anthony Taylor: So

652
01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:30.170
Anthony Taylor: and that's pretty much it. So wait, let me go see, do I have an activity? I do have an example. So let's show the example.

653
01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:33.800
Anthony Taylor: This one's exciting.

654
01:00:34.310 --> 01:00:39.360
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So what do we got here crowdfunding data. I'm excited about crowdfunding data.

655
01:00:42.350 --> 01:00:50.220
Anthony Taylor: So we got goal pledge backers, backers, count, country staff, big spotlight category days, active outcome.

656
01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:54.029
Anthony Taylor: This is what we're going to be going after our outcome.

657
01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:55.920
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

658
01:00:57.130 --> 01:01:05.700
Anthony Taylor: so we're gonna grab everything except outcome. Put it in our X everything. Our our only outcome put it in our Y,

659
01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:10.500
Anthony Taylor:  so, looking at this data, does this need to be scaled

660
01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:13.600
Anthony Taylor: desperately?

661
01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:21.820
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, absolutely right. I mean, look at these numbers. So we're definitely going to do that. Now, note.

662
01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:24.970
Anthony Taylor: we're not scaling yet. We're training and testing.

663
01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.670
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now.

664
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:38.639
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to. Now, this is different than what we did before. So kind of pay attention. Here. I'm creating a variable. I'm basically instantiating and training

665
01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:40.070
Anthony Taylor: my scalar.

666
01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:44.729
Anthony Taylor: And this is me training it

667
01:01:44.770 --> 01:01:50.589
Anthony Taylor: and putting it in this variable. Okay, kind of like a regular model.

668
01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:57.270
Anthony Taylor: Now, I'm going to transform this data I just trained on

669
01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:00.819
Anthony Taylor: and I am done. It is now trained.

670
01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.160
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this.

671
01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:07.240
Anthony Taylor: this new scalar I'm going to use

672
01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:12.300
Anthony Taylor: on test data I'm going to use on incoming data everything

673
01:02:13.690 --> 01:02:22.360
Anthony Taylor: I've trained it. It is done. I'm going to use it everywhere. This is where that machine learning pipeline I showed you the other day becomes super helpful.

674
01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:26.900
Anthony Taylor: because what you do, new data comes in. You pass it through the pipeline.

675
01:02:26.930 --> 01:02:27.959
Anthony Taylor: out it goes.

676
01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:37.750
Anthony Taylor: okay. So now we've trained our scalar. Yeah, no, please do. Is that why you didn't?

677
01:02:37.770 --> 01:02:40.180
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Is that why you split it first.

678
01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:43.640
Anthony Taylor: you didn't right? Because we only wanted to use the training data.

679
01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:45.460
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay?

680
01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:55.799
Anthony Taylor: Right? And and the the good news about that is so remember what we said. Why didn't you train test split? Do I remember the the definition? Why do you train test split

681
01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:00.200
Meredith McCanse (she/her): so that you can

682
01:03:02.110 --> 01:03:05.800
Meredith McCanse (she/her):  test with different data than what you train with.

683
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:13.889
Anthony Taylor: you could test with unseen data. So if we scale the data while the testing data is in it.

684
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.329
Anthony Taylor: haven't we already

685
01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:21.279
Anthony Taylor: given it the answer for the scaling? We did. We're not testing our scalar anymore.

686
01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:25.879
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so now, by doing this, we've

687
01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:30.879
Anthony Taylor: trained it on our training data. And now we're going to apply it.

688
01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:32.529
Anthony Taylor: Do our testing date

689
01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:40.560
Meredith McCanse (she/her): to do the same thing where you get like a score, an accuracy score of the scalar.

690
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:44.680
Anthony Taylor: The good news is, is there isn't a score on the scale.

691
01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:55.179
Anthony Taylor: but it can affect your final score on your mom. Alright, now, I've never seen them break this way. This is just good practice.

692
01:03:55.350 --> 01:03:59.039
Anthony Taylor: And and again, the important thing to remember

693
01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:04.319
Anthony Taylor: is that we're we're not building these models to just do big bachelors.

694
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:10.600
Anthony Taylor: Okay? More times than not. Models get put into an Api.

695
01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:12.660
Anthony Taylor: and

696
01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:16.720
Anthony Taylor: people call the models with like one row of data.

697
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:20.939
Anthony Taylor: Right? Here's a row of data predict this value for

698
01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:27.220
Anthony Taylor: okay. So when that row of data comes into our Api that we create.

699
01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:33.729
Anthony Taylor: we're gotta scale it. We've got to prep it any. If we do one hot encoding, you got to do that

700
01:04:34.450 --> 01:04:39.490
Anthony Taylor: right? You gotta do everything you did to this data to that incoming row of data.

701
01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:40.999
Anthony Taylor: When you're done.

702
01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:48.040
Anthony Taylor: then you can pass it into the model and get a prediction. But if you don't do everything exactly the same.

703
01:04:48.210 --> 01:04:49.550
Anthony Taylor: the predictions about

704
01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:58.820
Anthony Taylor: which is why we train our scalar this way. So that now incoming data, we can apply the exact same

705
01:04:58.890 --> 01:05:02.970
Anthony Taylor: scaling algorithm that we trained on our training data.

706
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:05.340
Anthony Taylor: and we know we'll get the same result.

707
01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:08.070
Anthony Taylor: Alright, that's the point.

708
01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:14.450
Anthony Taylor: I feel like I really explained the hell out of that. Has everybody got that. Everybody clear on that. Mostly.

709
01:05:15.030 --> 01:05:19.979
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I get so we can, just for giggles.

710
01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:28.430
Anthony Taylor: Take a look and see the minimax of our scaled models. Okay. should they be exactly the same?

711
01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:36.589
Anthony Taylor: Only if our training and test data just happened to have the same than in Max, Paddy.

712
01:05:37.310 --> 01:05:42.839
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But as long as they're close, we can feel pretty confident that we did a good job.

713
01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:53.130
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And these are very close. Okay? And here we're gonna do the same thing with Min and Max. Remember, Min and Max is only 0 to one

714
01:05:53.810 --> 01:05:57.230
Anthony Taylor: again, we can apply it to our test data.

715
01:05:57.340 --> 01:06:01.569
Anthony Taylor: and we can look at. Oh, well, look at that. Holy. Okay.

716
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:04.329
Anthony Taylor: Now, there's an interesting thing that just happened.

717
01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:08.869
Anthony Taylor: How can that happen if I just told you it's only 0 to one.

718
01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:14.560
Derek Rikke: the training data 0 to one.

719
01:06:16.170 --> 01:06:20.379
Anthony Taylor: Exactly. So the the algorithm that was created

720
01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:24.529
Anthony Taylor: in our training data, the Max value

721
01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:28.900
Anthony Taylor: was, let's say it was 500. Okay.

722
01:06:29.730 --> 01:06:34.079
Anthony Taylor: in the testing data, there was something bigger than 500.

723
01:06:36.030 --> 01:06:40.410
Anthony Taylor: So when it applied the exact same scalar algorithm.

724
01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:43.490
Anthony Taylor: it actually made a number bigger than one.

725
01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:47.799
Anthony Taylor: Is that a problem? No, because it's not ever going to be significantly big?

726
01:06:49.050 --> 01:06:54.670
Anthony Taylor: Alright. But if you didn't like this, what would you do? How would you resolve this?

727
01:06:55.310 --> 01:06:56.790
Anthony Taylor: There is a way to resolve

728
01:06:59.230 --> 01:07:01.019
Derek Rikke: trying to explore. You guys think

729
01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:04.260
Anthony Taylor: Barrett Bingo Barrett.

730
01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:12.010
Anthony Taylor: you just rerun train test split right now, could it happen again? Yeah. what would you do then run it again?

731
01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:18.280
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you would. Basically. Because, remember, train test split is a random raw of the data.

732
01:07:18.830 --> 01:07:19.780
Anthony Taylor: So

733
01:07:20.090 --> 01:07:23.630
Anthony Taylor: odds of it happening over and over and over again, very unlike.

734
01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:33.569
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, that's and if it really bugged you, then you would go find the highest value and just run it until you make sure that you got it in your training set

735
01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.339
Anthony Taylor: instead of your testing set.

736
01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:40.800
Anthony Taylor: But yeah. okay. was that pretty clear?

737
01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:44.040
Anthony Taylor: Alright?

738
01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:52.809
Anthony Taylor: So like I said, I said we would do that, and then we'll do break. And then when you guys come back we'll do the activity. So I'll see you

739
01:07:54.690 --> 01:07:55.830
Anthony Taylor: 10 after.

740
01:07:56.910 --> 01:07:58.640
Anthony Taylor: Alright guys. See you then

741
01:07:58.690 --> 01:08:01.960
Anthony Taylor: hope. hey, everybody, welcome back.

742
01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.730
Clayton Graves: We think there were missing steps.

743
01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:11.949
Anthony Taylor: I don't know half classes here like 20 min early.

744
01:08:12.210 --> 01:08:14.559
Anthony Taylor: So where they're missing steps, Matt.

745
01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:20.179
Dipinto, Matt: 25. Just. Matt said. No.

746
01:08:20.319 --> 01:08:28.790
Dipinto, Matt: it said that I don't know how to scale it in 2 different ways and score unless I missed something very possible.

747
01:08:29.410 --> 01:08:31.970
Anthony Taylor: Here we go import

748
01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:37.260
Anthony Taylor: import. We have some data. pretty exciting stuff.

749
01:08:38.979 --> 01:08:48.990
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna get rid of churn. and we're going to assign it to our label. Really exciting. Now we do our train test split.

750
01:08:49.479 --> 01:08:56.320
Anthony Taylor: Stop me if anybody doesn't remember any of this. Pretty sure we're all together. Here's the new thing, the first new thing

751
01:08:56.520 --> 01:09:04.639
Anthony Taylor: we're going to fit our standard scalar, and then we're going to transform or apply it to our training data.

752
01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:10.359
And then we're going to apply it to our testing data.

753
01:09:12.930 --> 01:09:16.170
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And now we just model it

754
01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:22.839
Anthony Taylor: like before. So we pick our model. We fit our model to our trained, scaled data. We score it.

755
01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:30.280
Meredith McCanse (she/her): We had a question about this step, Anthony, how come we never. Why do we never scale the Y

756
01:09:30.310 --> 01:09:31.450
Meredith McCanse (she/her): data?

757
01:09:32.170 --> 01:09:35.560
Anthony Taylor: Well. normally, okay, so

758
01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:41.939
Anthony Taylor: why data? We don't scale because we want to see the actual value.

759
01:09:42.399 --> 01:09:48.289
Anthony Taylor: Now, you may encode it. Keep that in mind. So like, if it was a word.

760
01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:53.050
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you might encode it. And then, when you're done, you have to decode.

761
01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:55.869
Anthony Taylor: so say it was green and blue

762
01:09:55.890 --> 01:09:57.310
Anthony Taylor: right? Well.

763
01:09:57.630 --> 01:10:00.620
Anthony Taylor: at at least, when it comes to logistic regression.

764
01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:06.860
Anthony Taylor: Well, you could probably get away with lists with some of the models you would have to encode that into a number

765
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:12.309
Anthony Taylor: alright, and then at the end of it, you would decode it back into green or blue.

766
01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:19.310
Anthony Taylor: they'd say, 0 is green, one is blue, and you would encode it, and then you would do it. But in in like, in

767
01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:23.950
Anthony Taylor: all of the cases today that our value has been 0 or what.

768
01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:26.489
Anthony Taylor: So there's no reason to encode.

769
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.360
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, cause we want to see the original value

770
01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:30.669
Anthony Taylor: was a good question.

771
01:10:31.930 --> 01:10:32.819
Anthony Taylor: I like it

772
01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:42.379
Anthony Taylor: cool. Okay. So our training data score was, our testing was. looks like a good mob.

773
01:10:42.570 --> 01:10:48.399
Anthony Taylor: Now, same thing. We're just going to change the way we scaled it. We're going to use Min, Max.

774
01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:50.859
Anthony Taylor: We're going to fit it to our training data.

775
01:10:50.900 --> 01:11:01.470
Anthony Taylor: So we basically have trained the the scalar. Now we're going to apply it to our testing data. and then we're going to do the exact same modeling and score it.

776
01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:07.230
Anthony Taylor: And look at what we got? So answer the question, which one was better.

777
01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:16.700
Anthony Taylor: 89, 5, 89, 3, 89, 2, 89, 7. Wow!

778
01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:21.499
Anthony Taylor: That's a tough one. So they're saying, Min, Max Scalar.

779
01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:27.499
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I almost would say you'd be okay with either one. In this case.

780
01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:29.469
Anthony Taylor: you guys see why.

781
01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:34.960
Anthony Taylor: even though the testing score was a tiny bit higher. The the training score was actually low.

782
01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:42.620
Anthony Taylor: So it's kind of like, yeah, we're talking hundreds of a point. Yeah, you're probably fine.

783
01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:43.859
Anthony Taylor: I passed it in

784
01:11:46.150 --> 01:11:48.060
Clayton Graves: so sure where there we go.

785
01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:53.539
Anthony Taylor: So thousands, sorry, not hundreds, thousands

786
01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:56.720
Anthony Taylor: thou live. Hi.

787
01:11:57.090 --> 01:12:02.459
Anthony Taylor: did. Is that okay, Cling? Did you find what you missed. Did I hear you? Okay? Good.

788
01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:04.360
Anthony Taylor: Anybody else?

789
01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:07.490
Anthony Taylor: Questions?

790
01:12:09.010 --> 01:12:09.910
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

791
01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:16.420
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So

792
01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:28.029
Anthony Taylor: we learn logistic regression today. Binary classification model, as far as speed goes. Probably I mean only only one faster than logistic regression is linear regression.

793
01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:37.620
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Which linear regression, as we know, is not very effective. Logistic regression is actually very effective in binary classification

794
01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:44.790
Anthony Taylor: fact. If you have a binary question, you should probably try logistic regression first every single time.

795
01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:49.499
Anthony Taylor: Compute-wise, cost-wise, it's incredible.

796
01:12:50.670 --> 01:12:51.560
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

797
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:54.040
Anthony Taylor:  but

798
01:12:54.760 --> 01:13:02.740
Anthony Taylor: you won't always have a binary classification. You may run into something where

799
01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:05.859
Anthony Taylor: you need to separate more

800
01:13:05.950 --> 01:13:08.630
Anthony Taylor: than to classes.

801
01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:13.250
Anthony Taylor: and that is where we're going to get into

802
01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:23.769
Anthony Taylor: a support vector machine. Now, first off, we're gonna start with just 2 classes, because we want to show you how support vector works. So just looking at this screen.

803
01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:33.489
Anthony Taylor: What class would you say this, this off blue dot belongs to this one or this?

804
01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:39.890
michael mcpherson: What'd you say, Derek?

805
01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:42.550
Derek Rikke: Or anybody? Blue

806
01:13:43.370 --> 01:13:50.009
Anthony Taylor: the light blue. Maybe right? So if the line that got fit to this went straight up through here.

807
01:13:50.130 --> 01:13:54.979
Anthony Taylor: I would completely agree. But what if the line went through here.

808
01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:59.549
Anthony Taylor: Well, now, it's dark.

809
01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:03.080
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

810
01:14:03.870 --> 01:14:15.110
Anthony Taylor: it could be on the line. Yeah. Well, then, you have another argument, right? You know. So you could have a line like this. You could have a line like this. You could have a line like this

811
01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:22.240
Anthony Taylor: like this. I mean, there's all kinds of variations of how this could go, depending on how the model fit the line.

812
01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:24.910
Anthony Taylor: See how that looks

813
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.289
Anthony Taylor: right here. It's light blue here. It's dark blue

814
01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:31.459
Anthony Taylor: here. It's light blue.

815
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:33.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

816
01:14:34.210 --> 01:14:43.169
Anthony Taylor: But the interesting thing is is like, how far from the line is, well, this one is clearly like blue, but it's kind of close to the line, while in this one

817
01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:46.500
Anthony Taylor: it's like, Oh, well, there's no question that's like.

818
01:14:48.710 --> 01:14:53.779
Anthony Taylor: okay, so what support vector machines do

819
01:14:54.060 --> 01:15:02.650
Anthony Taylor: is they create a hyperplane. The hyperplane is a little different than what we've seen in the past.

820
01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:12.900
Anthony Taylor: So in a hyperplane, oh, what's this cool slide machine, miles to illustrate this? Oh, okay. So in a hyperplane, we're going to create a line

821
01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:22.530
Anthony Taylor: going through the middle of our deep. straight up. Okay? All right. They want me to talk about this before I get to the cool line.

822
01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:30.449
Anthony Taylor: So Svm's, we're gonna get to this in second, Svm's a little different than logistic regression, because it can work with multi class.

823
01:15:30.570 --> 01:15:35.879
Anthony Taylor: That means that the line is no longer like on a 2D plot.

824
01:15:36.650 --> 01:15:37.890
Anthony Taylor: It can be

825
01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:45.509
Anthony Taylor: literally a plane going through space to handle multi-dimensional data.

826
01:15:45.930 --> 01:15:53.390
Anthony Taylor: and by multi-dimensional I don't mean they have more features. I mean, they go that direction, that direction, this direction, this stretch.

827
01:15:54.670 --> 01:16:06.260
Anthony Taylor: this direction, this direction. So the plane cuts through all of that. Okay? And you're gonna see a picture of it in a second. So you can, you can think about like how they flat

828
01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:08.600
Anthony Taylor: a a.

829
01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:14.689
Anthony Taylor: The globe, right? So you could look at it on a flat thing. So Svm, does this in reverse.

830
01:16:14.890 --> 01:16:17.819
Anthony Taylor: It takes a flat map and projects it onto a globe.

831
01:16:18.410 --> 01:16:25.630
Anthony Taylor:  Don't worry about that right now. I'm gonna show it to you, but hang in there for a second, this is where I was trying to get, you see.

832
01:16:26.890 --> 01:16:41.139
Anthony Taylor: So what Sbm does is it finds the best fit line through the data. Now. in this particular case this data is pretty clear. all right. This is not the way it is all the time.

833
01:16:41.330 --> 01:16:44.670
Anthony Taylor: But again, as Rodney pointed out earlier.

834
01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:47.399
Anthony Taylor: the data in class is practically perfect.

835
01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:51.780
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so the line goes through nice and clean.

836
01:16:51.810 --> 01:16:54.030
Anthony Taylor: It then creates

837
01:16:54.070 --> 01:17:01.089
Anthony Taylor: these additional lines. Okay, which is this which make up the hyperplane.

838
01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:10.109
Anthony Taylor: Anything in this hyperplane is now not necessarily

839
01:17:10.270 --> 01:17:11.570
Anthony Taylor: one or the other.

840
01:17:13.470 --> 01:17:16.070
Anthony Taylor: It's kind of gray area.

841
01:17:16.210 --> 01:17:18.979
Anthony Taylor: except for in this case the tan area

842
01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:23.810
Anthony Taylor: they should've used gray that would have made that so perfect.

843
01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:31.529
Anthony Taylor: But in this case it's kinda gonna be like. So this one would have most likely been classified as like blue.

844
01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:34.759
Anthony Taylor: But in some examples.

845
01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:43.100
Anthony Taylor:  okay, we got one coming up. and some examples that won't always be so obvious.

846
01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:44.250
Anthony Taylor: So

847
01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:55.529
Anthony Taylor: the the hyperplane is really cool. It's a line. It does an equidistant lines from the centric line to make up the plane. In this case this is a huge hyperplane.

848
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:59.170
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now let's get to one that's more realistic.

849
01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:00.880
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

850
01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:04.179
Anthony Taylor: there you go.

851
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:09.180
Anthony Taylor: Alright. This is more like what you really gonna see.

852
01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:17.079
Anthony Taylor: And notice some of the dots on that side are light blue. Some of them on this side are dark blue.

853
01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:27.590
Anthony Taylor: Anything within that hyperplane could go either direction. And whatever, however, the algorithm trains it. That's how it's going to go.

854
01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:34.050
Anthony Taylor: So it while this doesn't look horrifically accurate, it's actually really good.

855
01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:42.040
Anthony Taylor: Because now. when you apply this to 3D data. multi-classification.

856
01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:44.430
Anthony Taylor: Now, you can see, there's this plane.

857
01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:50.220
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's going. It's slicing into that. So imagine

858
01:18:50.430 --> 01:18:52.870
Anthony Taylor: you have a box filled with

859
01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:57.629
Anthony Taylor: with balls. The balls like the kids play in right at chuck E cheese.

860
01:18:58.470 --> 01:19:00.979
Anthony Taylor: That does that mean something to everybody?

861
01:19:01.210 --> 01:19:04.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So they got a bulb here. 3 color balls.

862
01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:11.739
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you take a big piece of flat cardboard and try to put it into the ball pit

863
01:19:12.050 --> 01:19:14.720
Anthony Taylor: to separate the 3 color balls from each other.

864
01:19:15.970 --> 01:19:18.190
Anthony Taylor: That's Svm.

865
01:19:19.490 --> 01:19:21.199
Anthony Taylor: that big old piece of wood

866
01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:28.129
Anthony Taylor: that our big cardboard, that big old piece of cardboard is the algorithm that is slicing through this three-dimensional space.

867
01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:32.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then, when you're done, make sure you sanitize because those calls are nasty.

868
01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:39.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. So how we all live through chucky cheese is beyond me.

869
01:19:41.770 --> 01:19:47.529
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, the other thing that's cool about Svm is, it is actually capable of doing something like this

870
01:19:48.710 --> 01:19:56.420
Anthony Taylor: because it's not a logistic regression. It's not a linear regression. It can actually have nonlinear

871
01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:59.530
Anthony Taylor: record of lines

872
01:19:59.650 --> 01:20:00.630
Anthony Taylor: planes.

873
01:20:01.610 --> 01:20:06.970
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it is perfectly capable of doing something like this. Can it do the circle? No.

874
01:20:08.030 --> 01:20:09.760
Anthony Taylor: But it can do this.

875
01:20:11.930 --> 01:20:20.420
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So if your data looks like this, you can actually use an Svm. Another good thing about Svm, Svm is again all math based.

876
01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:25.429
Anthony Taylor: So, since it's all math-based, it's pretty doggone fast. Everything is math.

877
01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:27.280
Anthony Taylor: But this is a fairly simple.

878
01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:31.390
Anthony Taylor: as far as math goes. This is a fairly simple model.

879
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:36.000
Anthony Taylor: So let's take a look at this.

880
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:43.370
Anthony Taylor: What do we got? We got occupancy, experimental data used for binary classification.

881
01:20:43.570 --> 01:20:49.449
Anthony Taylor: temperature, humidity, light. CO. 2. Brown tooth, occupancy, ground, truth, occupancy.

882
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.050
Anthony Taylor: timestamp pictures taken every minute. Okay.

883
01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:55.889
Anthony Taylor: so that's our data.

884
01:20:59.430 --> 01:21:04.749
Anthony Taylor: So these are the values that were taken. And this is was that spot occupied or not

885
01:21:04.830 --> 01:21:06.640
Anthony Taylor: it say what it was occupied with.

886
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:10.069
Anthony Taylor: does it? Does it?

887
01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:12.950
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

888
01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:21.739
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna do our train test split the same. We're gonna get our X, the same. Nothing's changing train test split.

889
01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:30.119
Anthony Taylor: We're going okay. So while it is an Svm model, we call it Sbc, I don't know. Don't ask. I have no idea. I don't know. I don't know.

890
01:21:30.130 --> 01:21:31.670
Anthony Taylor: I know. You wanna ask.

891
01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:35.270
Anthony Taylor: why is it called Svc. When it's Svm. I don't know.

892
01:21:35.490 --> 01:21:37.610
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I could probably find out.

893
01:21:37.890 --> 01:21:40.260
Anthony Taylor: But I'm not good. Okay? So

894
01:21:42.190 --> 01:21:47.600
Anthony Taylor: I didn't know you left. Okay. So we select our model.

895
01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:55.630
Anthony Taylor: We're going to use a linear kernel. Just that's the I'm pretty sure that's the default. So you technically don't have to put that in there. But put it in there for now.

896
01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:59.710
Anthony Taylor: because we're only doing 2. Okay?

897
01:21:59.850 --> 01:22:07.220
Anthony Taylor: Actually, it doesn't matter. You use linear on more than 2. Anyway. we're going to do our fit. So we we model

898
01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:08.750
Anthony Taylor: we fit.

899
01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:11.949
Anthony Taylor: This one takes a little longer.

900
01:22:12.970 --> 01:22:15.850
Anthony Taylor: How much data do we get? We didn't ask. It

901
01:22:17.630 --> 01:22:19.360
Clayton Graves: takes about 12 s.

902
01:22:20.590 --> 01:22:22.920
Anthony Taylor: Well, thanks, Clayton.

903
01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:27.720
Anthony Taylor: you must have a better computer. Me, mine's at 13.5.

904
01:22:29.630 --> 01:22:31.140
Anthony Taylor: That means you're way ahead. And

905
01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:44.950
Anthony Taylor: and then we score it. Look at those scores. Those are pretty nice scores. Okay, now, we're going to take that. And we're going to apply our testing data guys. It's no different than the logistic regression.

906
01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:49.570
Anthony Taylor: And you predict pass in test. you're gonna get the results.

907
01:22:49.710 --> 01:22:56.470
Anthony Taylor: And then you're gonna score it. In this case we're gonna do accuracy. 98, 5. That's crazy. Good.

908
01:22:58.180 --> 01:22:59.210
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

909
01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:06.760
Anthony Taylor: Now, I will warn you guys 95 when I said, it's crazy. Good because you don't hardly ever see bank. But

910
01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:11.050
Anthony Taylor: unless you're working with academic data. Okay.

911
01:23:11.250 --> 01:23:16.849
Raugewitz, Tania: it's just, I mean, that's a great model. So what would a typical value be?

912
01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:28.579
Anthony Taylor: It it? It varies so much. I mean, 98 5 is just that's like practically perfect, I would say.

913
01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:32.970
Anthony Taylor: when I get in the nineties with most of our models we're pretty excited.

914
01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:37.300
Raugewitz, Tania: but when you're in the like 75.

915
01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:57.510
Anthony Taylor: It depends on what we're doing, you know, that goes back to the whole model where spank right marketing versus bank. If it's if if I don't really care that much. 75 is fine. It's like, that's okay. If it's a little off right. But we're getting it more often than we're not. Now. When you get to 50, you're down to like the point. What's the point?

916
01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:58.850
Raugewitz, Tania: Okay? Okay.

917
01:23:58.930 --> 01:24:10.319
Anthony Taylor: yeah. So so usually 70 to 90, you're like 70 to 80. You're like, yeah, could probably use it unless it's meant to predict something important.

918
01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:13.160
Anthony Taylor: and then you would stay back off.

919
01:24:13.410 --> 01:24:17.819
Anthony Taylor: But there are ways to tune it. And then what? So let me just give you guys this.

920
01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:23.340
Anthony Taylor: if let's say, this was a real situation that I worked okay.

921
01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:28.550
Anthony Taylor: and I got 90. I got. I didn't get 98, 5. I got 78. Thought

922
01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:38.739
Anthony Taylor: now I could stop there if that was acceptable. But why would it do that? What would I do next? I would go to a new mom. I'd go try a different model.

923
01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:43.869
Anthony Taylor: Maybe I try another mop and then another until I get it up. But what you're gonna find

924
01:24:44.050 --> 01:24:52.020
Anthony Taylor: as we get through all of this stuff. you're gonna find some models are better at some things than others. Svm.

925
01:24:52.150 --> 01:24:54.240
Anthony Taylor: for this data set.

926
01:24:54.320 --> 01:25:05.839
Anthony Taylor: This is a small. easy to read data set. Svm's gonna fly through this and nail it. Okay? But also. there's really not that many options

927
01:25:07.370 --> 01:25:09.070
Anthony Taylor: multiply this by

928
01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:11.350
Anthony Taylor: 5

929
01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:18.080
Anthony Taylor: or 10. That's probably more realistic to a data set which you would think

930
01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:26.340
Anthony Taylor: would make this more accurate. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't depends on what patterns it finds. Okay.

931
01:25:26.530 --> 01:25:31.690
Anthony Taylor: But the answer, the real answer is, this is a great score I'm going to keep.

932
01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:35.270
Anthony Taylor: Probably probably not gonna shoot for 99.

933
01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:37.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but

934
01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:42.310
Anthony Taylor: in the real world, if you get like a 70 or an 80, you would just go to the next model.

935
01:25:42.730 --> 01:25:45.790
Anthony Taylor: and you would just keep going. And there's hundreds

936
01:25:46.330 --> 01:25:52.480
Anthony Taylor: of models. Cool thing is. I have ways to automate that. Yeah, Matt.

937
01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:56.600
Dipinto, Matt: Hello, Did you

938
01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:01.700
Dipinto, Matt: explicitly say out loud, why? Or I guess we didn't scale this data. Right?

939
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:05.980
Dipinto, Matt: It just goes. You could have absolutely

940
01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:14.860
Anthony Taylor: okay. So there's no like precedent where you just don't scale Svm data. And it goes back to what I was telling you guys earlier.

941
01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:18.719
Anthony Taylor: You're in my opinion, you're safer scaling every time

942
01:26:18.890 --> 01:26:25.310
Anthony Taylor: versus scaling based on your idea or your thought on it. No, just whoever put this activity together just didn't put it.

943
01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:30.290
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, it's good question. Yeah, Meredith.

944
01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:41.489
Meredith McCanse (she/her): with all the models out there, and I imagine they change pretty rapidly, too. How do you keep track of them? I mean, I know you mentioned. You have ways of automating. But like, how do you?

945
01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:43.589
Meredith McCanse (she/her): How do you

946
01:26:43.810 --> 01:26:49.149
Meredith McCanse (she/her): do you like sheet sheet somewhere, and to keep track it like, how do you pop it out?

947
01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:55.479
Anthony Taylor: I wish there was such a thing. One of my favorites is, there's a lot of newsletters

948
01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:58.879
Anthony Taylor: and stuff towards data. Science is a very good one.

949
01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:13.889
Anthony Taylor:  this is actually part of medium. So if you don't have a subscription they will, you'll you'll only be able to read a few articles. But yeah. And these days, even towards data, science is all in.

950
01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:17.170
Anthony Taylor: Well, no, I mean, there's a there's a gan model

951
01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:23.980
Anthony Taylor: for fraud. Detection graph is really big deal right now. But

952
01:27:25.130 --> 01:27:34.290
Anthony Taylor: here's the good news you made us, you when you said something you probably didn't notice. I was like Nope. you said they change all the time. Guess what? They really don't.

953
01:27:35.260 --> 01:27:38.110
Anthony Taylor: Okay, they, for the most part.

954
01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:41.250
Anthony Taylor: and I don't know what stats are. But

955
01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:47.789
Anthony Taylor: out of the probably thousands of known models that people are using all over the world. There's probably like

956
01:27:48.450 --> 01:27:51.159
Anthony Taylor: 150 that most people are using.

957
01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:55.289
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that that is like the most common.

958
01:27:55.570 --> 01:28:06.170
Anthony Taylor: and I don't know that that number could be off one direction or the other. But the point is is that unless you're the guy creating the model. And by creating it, I mean.

959
01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:13.559
Anthony Taylor: like we're saying, call logistic regression. They're like, you're like making that model itself like doing the algorithm in the back.

960
01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:17.650
Anthony Taylor: which that is that said, that's like the think tanks.

961
01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:21.979
Anthony Taylor: That's your Berkeley's and your Mit S. And those guys are doing that.

962
01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:27.989
Anthony Taylor: So most citizens, most data scientists, not even citizen data, science data, scientists period

963
01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:30.390
Anthony Taylor: are are looking at.

964
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:33.729
Anthony Taylor: you know, the most common mosques. And then, if you look at

965
01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:38.849
Anthony Taylor: tools that do this.

966
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:44.100
Anthony Taylor: I don't need you to tell me that I know what they are. So Microsoft has it.

967
01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:48.030
Anthony Taylor:  aws, has it

968
01:28:48.230 --> 01:28:51.429
Anthony Taylor: data bricks, which is a huge data platform as it.

969
01:28:53.330 --> 01:28:57.339
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, I mean, it's it's literally as simple as

970
01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:00.350
Anthony Taylor: you identify your problem classification.

971
01:29:00.630 --> 01:29:07.500
Anthony Taylor: forecasting regression. vision or Nlp, we're gonna do both of these later.

972
01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:12.930
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you put in the, you put you load the data and you say, Go.

973
01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:15.630
Anthony Taylor: and that's it.

974
01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:23.700
Anthony Taylor: And when it's all said done. it will. I'm trying to see if it's gonna give you the result in this lesson.

975
01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:33.279
Anthony Taylor:  yeah, when it's all said and done, it's going to give you the results tell you exactly which model and exactly how to.

976
01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:38.469
Anthony Taylor: Oh, and it gets easier. Still, you need to deploy it.

977
01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:43.059
Anthony Taylor: It goes. Do you want to deploy this. And you go. Yeah.

978
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:49.100
Anthony Taylor: just like that. Just like this, ready? Yeah. it's deployed.

979
01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:57.000
Anthony Taylor: And now you have a yeah URL with an Api and a key. and you give that to the people who need to use it.

980
01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:00.859
Anthony Taylor: Boom. And if you did it in azure or aws, it's scaled.

981
01:30:01.330 --> 01:30:04.130
Anthony Taylor: You could have a billion people hit it, and it'll be fine.

982
01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:08.750
Anthony Taylor: It'll it'll scale up for you.

983
01:30:09.580 --> 01:30:21.870
Anthony Taylor: So what? So like your your question should be bouncing through y'all's head? Well. And why do I learn all this stuff? Because you don't know. I mean, the auto-male volat is spectacular

984
01:30:22.110 --> 01:30:25.530
Anthony Taylor: at what it does one you may not always have access to it.

985
01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:33.519
Anthony Taylor: 2. It's not cheap. right? So here's an example of the cluster, a Gpu cluster

986
01:30:33.690 --> 01:30:38.449
Anthony Taylor: with this particular thing and 4 of them. This probably costs

987
01:30:39.070 --> 01:30:40.439
Anthony Taylor: 40 bucks an hour.

988
01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:46.960
Anthony Taylor: Okay, most auto-mail exercises that I have run took 2 to 3

989
01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:48.170
Anthony Taylor: gays.

990
01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:55.299
Anthony Taylor: So 40 bucks an hour, 25 h, 24 HA day, 3 days.

991
01:30:56.210 --> 01:30:59.290
Anthony Taylor: That's a lot of money. Okay?

992
01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:05.719
Anthony Taylor:  yeah. So you know you as I'm seeing. So here's the code to do it.

993
01:31:06.150 --> 01:31:12.770
Anthony Taylor: I'm looking for the output. I really wanted to show you guys the output. I might just have to do one for you another time. Show.

994
01:31:14.730 --> 01:31:17.009
See, we're still building it at this point.

995
01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:27.489
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So when you're all done, you can actually just ask it to give you the best model. and you get the best model, and once you do that you can register it.

996
01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:30.840
Anthony Taylor: And now it's ready to be used by anybody.

997
01:31:32.790 --> 01:31:37.000
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I think I went way beyond answering the question. But

998
01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:39.379
Anthony Taylor: just understand, these exist.

999
01:31:40.130 --> 01:31:41.950
Anthony Taylor: Okay, azure

1000
01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:44.649
Anthony Taylor: aws, actually, Google has one. Now.

1001
01:31:45.070 --> 01:31:54.490
Anthony Taylor: the data bricks. One is fantastic data. Bricks is spark, which is large scale. That's what I work on every day. So working with very large data.

1002
01:31:54.630 --> 01:32:08.370
Anthony Taylor: like billions of rows of data. And what it does is it distributes it across like hundreds of computers in memory. So we're able to like. I spend a lot of money moving data around.

1003
01:32:09.650 --> 01:32:12.120
Anthony Taylor: So yeah. okay.

1004
01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:16.019
Anthony Taylor: we did that one

1005
01:32:17.610 --> 01:32:23.100
Anthony Taylor: wait? Was there an activity? Oh, yeah, there it is. Alright. So you guys have a little activity

1006
01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:27.490
Anthony Taylor: with Svm again, it's basically what we just did

1007
01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:29.610
a

1008
01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:36.650
Anthony Taylor: look at this. They're giving you most of it. So you're gonna create the Svm model Svc model

1009
01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:39.719
Anthony Taylor: with the linear curve. You're going to fit it.

1010
01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:41.239
Anthony Taylor: gonna validate it.

1011
01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:46.260
Anthony Taylor: Look at the predictions, evaluate it again.

1012
01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:50.699
Anthony Taylor: II don't know how you're gonna need 15 min for this, but

1013
01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:53.589
Anthony Taylor: they want you to spend 15 min on this.

1014
01:32:55.130 --> 01:32:58.089
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So 15 min.

1015
01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:03.810
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Well, good work, everybody.

1016
01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:06.080
Anthony Taylor: Hi, how we do on Sbm

1017
01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:19.239
Anthony Taylor: was that when I saw a lot of people came back early on that one. so I'm guessing it was fairly straightforward. So let's quickly go through it.

1018
01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:26.680
Anthony Taylor: We import same stuff as before. You didn't see it. It's funny, I responded to Matt's response, that you know, it's a

1019
01:33:26.970 --> 01:33:31.199
Anthony Taylor: support vector. Classification. And I said, still doesn't make sense

1020
01:33:31.630 --> 01:33:38.359
Anthony Taylor: because it's an Svm. That we're doing it with. So the we learned all the rest of them are the same name as the model.

1021
01:33:39.290 --> 01:33:44.829
Dipinto, Matt: There's 4 different sub models in Svm, that's why it's got a different name

1022
01:33:44.980 --> 01:33:51.119
Anthony Taylor: depending on the linearity or polynomial, this of the divided.

1023
01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:59.250
Dipinto, Matt: Yeah. But you import them under different model names. So there's like the default. Svc is a linear kernel, anyway.

1024
01:33:59.690 --> 01:34:03.230
Anthony Taylor: There we go. I like it. Okay, so we have our data.

1025
01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:08.569
Anthony Taylor: We have our our label. We have our features.

1026
01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:18.629
Anthony Taylor: We're going to do our train test split. We're going to use Sv and linear kernel. And then we're gonna fit it.

1027
01:34:19.630 --> 01:34:21.670
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to score it.

1028
01:34:23.050 --> 01:34:26.940
Anthony Taylor: and I didn't fit it. I had that happen to me earlier today. It's like I missed the butt.

1029
01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:45.380
Anthony Taylor: and we got pretty good scores. Those are pretty nice. Okay. here, we're going to predict our, we're gonna test it against our labels and then do an accuracy test.

1030
01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:46.650
Anthony Taylor: Pretty nice.

1031
01:34:48.010 --> 01:34:49.039
Anthony Taylor: So yeah.

1032
01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:59.699
Anthony Taylor: funny. Oh, if you do it with logistic regression, what do you get? That's funny that they didn't. Or is this what we did earlier today? I'll bet you it is.

1033
01:35:01.790 --> 01:35:09.340
Masarirambi, Rodney: I think it's the predicting malware one.

1034
01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:12.509
Masarirambi, Rodney: Yeah, it's right here done.

1035
01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:14.920
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. See, there's that one.

1036
01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:17.179
Anthony Taylor: and there's got my

1037
01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:18.630
Anthony Taylor: pretty cool.

1038
01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:22.290
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I have a quick question pretty cool. Yes, ask away.

1039
01:35:22.380 --> 01:35:24.479
Meredith McCanse (she/her): It is question time.

1040
01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:30.339
Meredith McCanse (she/her): If you scroll up in the one that you just were showing right here the printing.

1041
01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:36.850
Meredith McCanse (she/her): And there's the percent point 3 F is that up telling it to round it to 3 or to

1042
01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:45.989
Anthony Taylor: yeah. So we probably don't remember, we actually did cover this for like 15 min way back.

1043
01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:48.580
Anthony Taylor: But yes, this is a formatting

1044
01:35:48.710 --> 01:35:54.079
Anthony Taylor: thing. So we're saying, we're gonna put a percent sign. And then a decimal with 3

1045
01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:55.540
Anthony Taylor: places.

1046
01:35:56.340 --> 01:36:01.110
Anthony Taylor: and then you pass in a number, and it'll do that or float, and it will do that for you.

1047
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:11.730
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, that's how it is. It's been a long time. So I totally am cool with the honestly, I hate this method. I would use F screen most of the time.

1048
01:36:13.060 --> 01:36:14.000
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay.

1049
01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:15.580
Anthony Taylor: yeah.

1050
01:36:17.190 --> 01:36:21.010
Anthony Taylor: Anybody else questions. queries.

1051
01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:27.160
Raugewitz, Tania: alright. So tomorrow. Sorry I was. I was on mute. I'm so sorry

1052
01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:33.350
Raugewitz, Tania: just to answer the question. It goes it asks you, how does it compare to the

1053
01:36:35.310 --> 01:36:41.410
Raugewitz, Tania: so wouldn't you say that's basically the same point 9 6 0 versus?

1054
01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:53.820
Anthony Taylor: It's this is one of those things. So if you take this number, for it's full length. right? This is significantly better if you just look at it from like this.

1055
01:36:55.350 --> 01:37:03.899
Anthony Taylor: And this, it's exactly the same right? So it just depends on what you're trying to do. But

1056
01:37:04.030 --> 01:37:09.959
Anthony Taylor: now let me give you the more important thing. Given these 2 values. I would use this one.

1057
01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:13.370
Anthony Taylor: not because of the value because of the model.

1058
01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:19.000
Anthony Taylor: Logistic regression is way. Better performing. then.

1059
01:37:19.150 --> 01:37:27.999
Anthony Taylor: then, pretty much any mob except linear regression. So from a level of performance, linear regression by far the easiest. But, as we saw, not very effective

1060
01:37:28.170 --> 01:37:30.780
Anthony Taylor: except for very specific situations.

1061
01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:33.460
Anthony Taylor: logistic regression would be next.

1062
01:37:34.510 --> 01:37:35.800
Raugewitz, Tania: Okay? So

1063
01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:39.119
Raugewitz, Tania: okay, so that's still kind of order of

1064
01:37:39.190 --> 01:37:40.370
Raugewitz, Tania: a preference.

1065
01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:45.109
Raugewitz, Tania: Or if everything else is equal, then go with logistics.

1066
01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:47.019
Raugewitz, Tania: regardless of the score.

1067
01:37:47.070 --> 01:37:49.250
Raugewitz, Tania: not regardless. But if they're close.

1068
01:37:49.290 --> 01:37:59.640
Anthony Taylor: if they're close or like said, if they're if they're fairly equal, then I would definitely choose this guy before this guy. Okay? So what if they're not fairly equal? And they should be?

1069
01:38:00.270 --> 01:38:10.900
Anthony Taylor: We don't know that they ever should. Right? So logistic may not just be able to fit the data. Some of the stuff we're gonna look at tomorrow. Logistic cannot do.

1070
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:15.640
Raugewitz, Tania: So it's not the right. Okay? So it's just not. It's not the right

1071
01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:22.959
Anthony Taylor: scoring method for that particular data set

1072
01:38:23.050 --> 01:38:28.809
Anthony Taylor: is just the scoring is the same for every model, the model. And if we go back to remember

1073
01:38:29.570 --> 01:38:35.940
Raugewitz, Tania: oh, yeah, no, I may. It's it's May. I don't have the right word. But I get what you're the right model.

1074
01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:46.469
Anthony Taylor: right? So Svm can do that logistic regression can't correct right? So if you did this with list regression, you'd get a terrible score.

1075
01:38:46.570 --> 01:38:53.089
Anthony Taylor: But Svm. Might get 89 right? So you'd have no idea. So that for sure type. But

1076
01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:56.840
Anthony Taylor: this data. logistic regression's gonna nail.

1077
01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:10.679
Anthony Taylor: right? So there would be no reason to use Svm, but you could still use it to test it and see cause. I mean, if they'll let's say, logistic regression that this for some reason, it's like a 90%

1078
01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:15.939
Anthony Taylor: right? But you do, Svm, and it gets a 95. Well, that might be worth the trade.

1079
01:39:16.090 --> 01:39:16.920
Raugewitz, Tania: Okay.

1080
01:39:17.330 --> 01:39:23.009
Anthony Taylor: one of the things to take away guys. This is a big interview discussion, too.

1081
01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:24.890
Anthony Taylor: the the

1082
01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:30.640
Anthony Taylor: data science is all about the trade off between cost

1083
01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:37.989
Anthony Taylor: and accuracy. Right? Because while we're all doing this on our laptops, it doesn't cost us any.

1084
01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:40.390
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's just not realistic

1085
01:39:41.210 --> 01:39:48.020
Anthony Taylor: in the real world. You're gonna be dealing with much larger data. And it costs money to make this work.

1086
01:39:48.090 --> 01:39:53.179
Anthony Taylor: And if that money is only gonna yield, you point 0 0 1%.

1087
01:39:54.810 --> 01:39:55.810
Anthony Taylor: Who cares?

1088
01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:07.439
Anthony Taylor: Okay, don't spend the month. Take take it for what it's worth. Well, and again, that depends on use case if that 0 0 one is what's gonna kick you over your threshold.

1089
01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:21.790
Anthony Taylor: then that's a good thing. anyway. Alright. Next class. we're gonna talk a little bit more about Svm, but multi classification. Actually, it's funny. It looks like it can do that circle one which is pretty exciting.

1090
01:40:21.850 --> 01:40:25.019
Anthony Taylor: depending on how that circle data is formed.

1091
01:40:25.340 --> 01:40:28.950
Anthony Taylor:  we're going to do nearest neighbor.

1092
01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:32.439
Anthony Taylor: which is kind of similar to clustering.

1093
01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:37.480
Anthony Taylor: I always get it mixed up K-means and K. And Ni always get it mixed up. But

1094
01:40:37.820 --> 01:40:48.969
Anthony Taylor: K. And N is classification. We're also gonna talk about decision trees. and I don't think we're gonna make it all the way to Random Forest. We might

1095
01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:52.430
Anthony Taylor: hold on. Let me see. Yeah, we're gonna try

1096
01:40:52.710 --> 01:40:55.150
Anthony Taylor: to make it to Random Forest, if not.

1097
01:40:55.370 --> 01:41:01.579
Anthony Taylor: friend of Forest will be Thursday. But yeah. So we got an exciting day on Wednesday.

1098
01:41:02.430 --> 01:41:06.020
Anthony Taylor: Otherwise I got nothing for you for the last 8 min.

1099
01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:10.140
Anthony Taylor: If you are free to go or stick around for office hours.

1100
01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:15.229
Anthony Taylor: have a great Tuesday. I'm going to go get a root canal in the morning, so

1101
01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:18.690
Anthony Taylor: I'm excited.

1102
01:41:18.850 --> 01:41:24.830
Anthony Taylor: Sorry, Buddy.
