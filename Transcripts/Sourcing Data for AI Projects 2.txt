00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.590
Anthony Taylor: Hi, so let's get some quick. Get ready for class stuff done.

2
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.709
Anthony Taylor: How many people have went out and got the 3 Api keys you were requested to get.

3
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:36.179
Anthony Taylor: Okay, let me restate that. Who is not got free. Api key that you were requested to get okay. So we need to do that real really fast. Alright?

4
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.420
Anthony Taylor:  the

5
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.530
Anthony Taylor: II don't know if you guys even know where to find them. So I'll put the links first one we're gonna go to is this one.

6
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

7
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.260
Anthony Taylor: And it looks like this.

8
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.649
Anthony Taylor: So you're going to create a login

9
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.089
Anthony Taylor: your screen when you get to it. It should, it should just let you

10
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.019
Anthony Taylor:  I'm

11
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.950
Anthony Taylor: I already have one. So it's not gonna let me do it again. But

12
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.419
Anthony Taylor: when you guys go there, that link I gave you should give you one.

13
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.650
Anthony Taylor: And

14
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.380
Anthony Taylor: I think maybe this join. Yeah, you could just do a join. So do join Tmd.

15
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.630
Anthony Taylor: there's no cost, no, nothing. But you have to do this to get an Api key.

16
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.569
Anthony Taylor: We're going to use Api keys today to actually talk to

17
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.640
Anthony Taylor: these databases. Once you have one.

18
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.109
Anthony Taylor: You will come in here for those that that have not done this yet.

19
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.400
Anthony Taylor: Come in here.

20
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.879
Anthony Taylor: and you and click on your icon up here.

21
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:05.130
Anthony Taylor: and it's probably in profile.

22
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.300
Anthony Taylor: And then, Api.

23
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.189
Anthony Taylor: and then this is your key. You will want to copy that and put that somewhere where you can get to it during class.

24
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.560
Anthony Taylor: Does anybody need me to show you that again?

25
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.590
Kanouff, Christine: Yes, please. Yeah. Worries.

26
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.450
Anthony Taylor: So you click on once you're logged in.

27
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.230
Anthony Taylor: you click on your little icon. It will be whatever the first letter of your username is

28
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:45.019
Anthony Taylor: okay. and then go to. So edit profile and then, under edit profile, go down to Api.

29
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.680
Anthony Taylor: and then the Api key is right there.

30
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.859
Dipinto, Matt: So it's asking me to put in like

31
00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:02.810
Dipinto, Matt: type of use application name URL blah blah blah to get. Maybe I can ever just just skip as much of that as I don't think it'll ask you to do anything big with it.

32
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.649
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, let's just whatever just say, student, zoom, zoom student.

33
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.210
Anthony Taylor: how we do it. Captain, do you have your Api keys that were requested for today?

34
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.489
Mason, Natalie: They have dinner.

35
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:34.560
Mason, Natalie: Okay, I know, but some people do it through me all.

36
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.030
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Does it make you fill out all these fields? Oh, gosh.

37
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.850
Meredith McCanse (she/her): no! You have to fill out all of them.

38
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.640
Anthony Taylor: Oh, when you create the first 10, that's possible.

39
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.770
Anthony Taylor: But just like I said, student education do whatever

40
00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.050
Meredith McCanse (she/her): the application summary is too short. You have to say more.

41
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.990
Anthony Taylor: I am a student. I'm learning stuff.

42
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.500
Anthony Taylor: They don't really care. It's just you have it.

43
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.309
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So when everybody's done with this.

44
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.849
Masarirambi, Rodney: maybe you can find me on there on Imdb.

45
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.500
Anthony Taylor: Oh, Rodney, what movie you in

46
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:25.380
Masarirambi, Rodney: a couple? So I need to update the profile. But hunting camp if you look that up you you'll find me there.

47
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.450
Anthony Taylor: We know a movie star.

48
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.850
michael mcpherson: hey? Class

49
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.090
Anthony Taylor: way decided.

50
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:42.980
Anthony Taylor: is it called Hunting camp like that? Yeah. Hunting camp. Oh, it's not on there. I'll I'll I'll say it might be on Imdb. But

51
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.240
Masarirambi, Rodney: yeah.

52
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:56.539
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Anthony, I'm apologize for not doing this. Where did it. Where's the information about doing this before? Because I don't see it in the model.

53
00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:59.769
Anthony Taylor: Clayton told me.

54
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:21.329
sonja baro: It's in the Pre. For instance, the screen you were talking about. What do I put in there? It gives you the prompts.

55
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:27.379
Anthony Taylor: Maybe I should go there while we're doing this. Yeah, Christine, you had a question. So

56
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.420
Kanouff, Christine: I got I'm down to the

57
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:43.629
Kanouff, Christine: Oh, jeez I just lost it. It's asking for application, name, application. URL, is that the

58
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.109
sonja baro: even if it works on that.

59
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.010
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Got it alright. I did part of this the other day the New York Times thing I did.

60
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.579
Anthony Taylor: Oh, good! So you have that one knocked out.

61
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.889
Anthony Taylor: I didn't realize there were more.

62
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:06.710
Anthony Taylor: There's 3 altogether. We're going to use all 3 of them today. It's very exciting. Actually, you know what's interesting.

63
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.679
Anthony Taylor: I see Github. Open weather.

64
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.930
Anthony Taylor: I don't see that. Oh, there it is the movie.

65
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.129
Anthony Taylor: Oh, there's only 3 fields.

66
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.699
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Christine, did you have another question, or did I forget

67
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.570
Kanouff, Christine: validation, errors? I don't know why.

68
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:33.189
Meredith McCanse (she/her): There's fields at the bottom where you have to do your whole like name. Address everything

69
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.119
Dipinto, Matt: alright. So is show is Christine, if it's not

70
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:44.950
Kanouff, Christine: yeah, let's see, we do have stuff where you might have to put credit card numbers in.

71
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.750
Anthony Taylor: Okay, eventually.

72
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:50.700
A,

73
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:58.360
sonja baro: I'm getting. Let's see, there was one with the web desktop after education.

74
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.309
Anthony Taylor: Let's do that.

75
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:08.130
Anthony Taylor: That's that might take away some of the restrictions. There you go. That's good submit. Okay, wait.

76
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.860
Anthony Taylor: Summary is too short. So go back up to your summary.

77
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.520
Kanouff, Christine:  and just type some more stuff in here.

78
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.969
Anthony Taylor: Type. Anthony is the coolest ever that works every time.

79
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.210
Anthony Taylor: Whatever you want, it doesn't matter.

80
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:36.589
sonja baro: Anthony, the open weather thing. One thing that was confusing to me was it was asking. It was time you that I was needed to have a license and pay for each call.

81
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:48.460
sonja baro: and it wasn't terribly expensive, but it was. It was just interesting. I was like, Okay, I gotta pay for this.

82
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:53.080
Anthony Taylor: Everybody has your key. Alright. So I'm gonna share my screen again

83
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:57.390
Anthony Taylor: and we'll move on to the next key. Okay?

84
00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:01.319
Anthony Taylor: If you, if you're following along in the module.

85
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.339
Anthony Taylor: we'll do, we'll do New York Times next.

86
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:09.910
Anthony Taylor: So I will give you this link in case somebody doesn't have it up and available.

87
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:17.319
Anthony Taylor: Whoop! Here we go. Okay. so this one.

88
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:22.940
Anthony Taylor:  there's a create an account. I already have one.

89
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:24.800
Anthony Taylor: So I'm going to go in here.

90
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:35.820
Anthony Taylor: So first go in and create your account. Let's look at that in canvas for those that aren't basic. Once you create it.

91
00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:38.299
Anthony Taylor: It's pretty much just your name and a password.

92
00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:42.570
Anthony Taylor:  Then

93
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.039
Anthony Taylor: where did mine go?

94
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:51.150
Anthony Taylor: Then

95
00:08:51.920 --> 00:09:00.500
Anthony Taylor: you're going to go up here in the top, and you would think you would go to Apis. Right? That seems like it would make the most sense it does. It's it's not where you go.

96
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:09.659
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Apis will tell you what Apis are available, but not give you the key. Once you are signed in, go to your login.

97
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.970
Anthony Taylor: and then there is an apps in the drop down. You guys see that

98
00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.070
Anthony Taylor: click on that and then create a new app.

99
00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:24.539
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And the app, you just have to put a name in a description. When you're done

100
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:27.740
Anthony Taylor: you will have something like this. You see, I do this all the time.

101
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:34.169
Anthony Taylor: What's the earliest? One June 20, first, 2,019.

102
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:37.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

103
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.160
Anthony Taylor: So

104
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.420
Anthony Taylor: once you have that you can click it.

105
00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:50.709
Anthony Taylor: And then you want this key right here. so you can just copy that and then take it and save it somewhere.

106
00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:56.450
Anthony Taylor: Okay. pretty exciting.

107
00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:02.860
Anthony Taylor: This one's really fun. We're gonna be today. What I like about today. If we get through everything today on time

108
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:08.579
Anthony Taylor: you are going to have things that you can show people. Now. it's like, check this out.

109
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:23.280
Anthony Taylor: It's pretty cool. I mean, I don't know. Have you guys shown anybody your stuff so far? Yeah, okay, well, good. This one in particular. I think this this date. There's like a lot of stuff

110
00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.570
Anthony Taylor: stuff that you could build on. Hi, are we good here

111
00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:32.249
Anthony Taylor: mostly. No. alright, I'll wait. I can wait.

112
00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:33.690
Anthony Taylor: No, what's wrong, Matt.

113
00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:41.489
Dipinto, Matt: struggling I the validation link failed. And now I'm just way behind. I'm I'm catching up there.

114
00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:46.560
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Alright! There's only one more to do, and it's pretty easy, too, so we'll we'll get there.

115
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:58.629
Mason, Natalie: and just for the record the validation keys returned back that they didn't work for me. But then they actually did so. If you just try logging in.

116
00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:04.479
Dipinto, Matt: So in now can you walk getting the Api key real quick?

117
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:08.239
Anthony Taylor: Umhm. click on your name at the top.

118
00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:14.190
Anthony Taylor: where you know your login at the top in the top right hand corner. Here. boop, boop!

119
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.489
Anthony Taylor: Am I still sharing? Yeah. I then go to apps.

120
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.659
Anthony Taylor: click that, and then do new app.

121
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:22.470
Dipinto, Matt: Thank you.

122
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.329
Anthony Taylor: And then, once you once you fill in the 2 blanks.

123
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:31.100
Anthony Taylor: the key itself is this, just hit the little copy button and go save it somewhere.

124
00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:37.410
michael mcpherson: I miss that where we gotta go to get to the apps.

125
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:42.449
Anthony Taylor: Click on your your name. Up in the top right hand corner the dropdown

126
00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:43.890
Anthony Taylor: click apps

127
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.460
Anthony Taylor: right there and then. New app

128
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.120
Anthony Taylor: got it?

129
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:05.840
Kanouff, Christine: Great!

130
00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.099
Anthony Taylor: Go ahead, Christine.

131
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:22.539
Kanouff, Christine: are we just sitting save from there? Or which one are we?

132
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.409
Anthony Taylor: You don't actually need off. But no, I didn't say that. Thank you for asking that question.

133
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.910
Anthony Taylor: Normally, I mean, like, if you were building an app

134
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:41.019
Anthony Taylor:  you wouldn't necessarily do all of them you would do just to let you

135
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.079
Anthony Taylor: cause you're basically like making too much work.

136
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:46.300
Anthony Taylor: But it's all good.

137
00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:54.449
Kanouff, Christine: And is it the app Id that we want? Right? Or is it the Api?

138
00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:57.779
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, she's like, I have a. By the way.

139
00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:04.569
Anthony Taylor: again, if you were writing a real app. Using this, you could disable the ones who are using it.

140
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:10.529
Anthony Taylor: This right here. or if you forgot to enable you come in here and enable underneath your app.

141
00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:15.849
Anthony Taylor: Okay. alright. Are we ready for the next one? One more

142
00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.290
Anthony Taylor: one or

143
00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.310
Anthony Taylor: the open weather? Api

144
00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.979
Anthony Taylor: copy. Link. Put it in slack.

145
00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so

146
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.510
Anthony Taylor: this one

147
00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:43.229
Anthony Taylor: looks like this. me log that? Well. I'm gonna log out real quick.

148
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:48.119
Anthony Taylor: alright. And this create an account. All you gotta do

149
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:54.179
Anthony Taylor: what you need to create account on this one. That's pretty easy.

150
00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:58.990
Anthony Taylor: Make sure you tell it. You're not a robot.

151
00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.329
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So I'm going to go on and log in

152
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.840
Anthony Taylor: once you're logged in.

153
00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:20.530
Anthony Taylor: you would think you could just go to Api right now go to your name in the top right corner and click on my Api keys.

154
00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:30.470
Anthony Taylor: and then there you can generate a new one. Just give it a name. Click, generate! You'll have a new key. and you just wanna copy it and save itself.

155
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:35.229
Anthony Taylor: I know that was fast. I'm totally hanging in here waiting for you

156
00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:36.399
Anthony Taylor: don't stress

157
00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:46.250
Kanouff, Christine: for business.

158
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.520
Anthony Taylor: It's education, really, but if it if it doesn't give you that option, don't worry about it.

159
00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.049
Anthony Taylor: No one's gonna no one's gonna be checking.

160
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:09.289
Anthony Taylor: Cowboys are playing right now. What's that all about?

161
00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:17.180
Clayton Graves: Oh, you guys are closer to Seattle, are you guys cowboys or Seattle? I wouldn't call it plane

162
00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:18.440
Raugewitz, Tania: chiefs.

163
00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:24.749
Anthony Taylor: Oh, is anybody there are those bronco guys right? Aren't they any good.

164
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:27.080
Anthony Taylor: or have they done nothing since Elway left?

165
00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:33.140
Clayton Graves: I can't hear you that you're coming in and out. There's something wrong.

166
00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:04.639
Gardner, Curry: I think Russell Wilson is getting his roi.

167
00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:16.240
Raugewitz, Tania: Yeah. But Taylor super bowl does he pay off?

168
00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:22.069
Masarirambi, Rodney: I think the cowboys, like one like once in like 50 years, or something like that like.

169
00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:30.510
Masarirambi, Rodney: That's why that's all I know. I know.

170
00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:43.720
Masarirambi, Rodney: I oh, that the the cowboys! All I know is that they're supposed to be America's team, but they've never but, like, you know, generations ago.

171
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:49.569
sonja baro: Yes, true, it's been like 20 years while the pressure is on. Dac Prescott.

172
00:16:51.130 --> 00:17:00.889
Anthony Taylor: I think it's been 20 years since they were. Let's see, they 72, 78 93

173
00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:10.180
Anthony Taylor: American Rugby. So confusing America's team.

174
00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:11.649
Anthony Taylor: I think he's cool.

175
00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:16.950
Anthony Taylor: Hi, so did everybody get their key while we were having that little side conversation.

176
00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:21.110
Anthony Taylor: I just my phone. It popped up that the cowboys were winning. And I was like.

177
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:25.699
Anthony Taylor: right now, that's I mean, I'm really into the Houston Texans right now, but

178
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:29.260
Anthony Taylor: because they're kind of cool, anyway. All right. So we got our keys.

179
00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:42.789
Anthony Taylor: Anybody need help with keys. Are we done with keys for the moment? I understand. If you didn't get them all, we'll work through it. Don't sweat it alright. So I'm going to close all that, because, honestly, we don't need to be back here again except to get keys.

180
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.029
Anthony Taylor: That's it.

181
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:46.829
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Now, where did my slide show? Go.

182
00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:51.739
Anthony Taylor: I close my slides here. Alright, 1 s

183
00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:58.489
Meredith McCanse (she/her): for the census one is that, should we do that for Monday?

184
00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:03.029
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, we can. Yeah. And census one. Yeah.

185
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:06.900
Anthony Taylor: yes, please do it Monday or whatever.

186
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:11.590
So we're gonna talk about those Api keys you just created, and why we have them.

187
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.969
Anthony Taylor: We're going to

188
00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:21.209
Anthony Taylor: this funny. I I was complaining yesterday about the E. And V library

189
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.789
Anthony Taylor: and I. It's

190
00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:27.680
Anthony Taylor: there's another one very similar to it that uses net

191
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:35.890
Anthony Taylor: right. And I was like, no, we don't want that. But now I know why they're using. We didn't do this before. It's actually a pretty cool way to do it. So we'll be doing this today.

192
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:41.130
Anthony Taylor: and basically, it's we're going to set environment variables on our computer

193
00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:46.470
Anthony Taylor: using python. And then that way, we can access them

194
00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:50.019
Anthony Taylor: without having to like. Store them in the file, even though

195
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:53.779
Anthony Taylor: they're gonna be stored in file. Okay? So

196
00:18:54.580 --> 00:19:02.389
Anthony Taylor: then we're going to use the Api keys to call some Apis, and we're going to learn about, try and accept.

197
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:07.220
Anthony Taylor: I use this every day 40 times a day.

198
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:11.880
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Very important concept for python.

199
00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:14.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But

200
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.959
Anthony Taylor: before we get started, we're going to do. And everyone do

201
00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.710
Anthony Taylor: all together.

202
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:25.619
which that literally be the definition of an everyone. Do

203
00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.480
Anthony Taylor: doing it all together.

204
00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:33.950
Anthony Taylor:  3.

205
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.669
Anthony Taylor: Bring up the readme over here.

206
00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.359
Anthony Taylor: So this is going to use that. Remember that. Live that

207
00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:56.720
Anthony Taylor: that cool numbers Api site we were looking at with date, trivia math. We're gonna use that. Okay? So we're gonna use the URL for that which is Http, Colon slash flash numbers

208
00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.360
Anthony Taylor: api.com.

209
00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:00.880
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

210
00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:04.169
Anthony Taylor: remember to read the first cell.

211
00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:07.550
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

212
00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:13.480
Anthony Taylor:  then we're going to have. Do you guys remember all the options

213
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.970
Anthony Taylor: that were available to us

214
00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.240
Anthony Taylor: if I can remember, or if you want to go to the site, you can do that.

215
00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:23.789
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Here, we'll just quickly pop in. Here, take a look.

216
00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:33.130
Anthony Taylor: math, trivia dates. math, trivia date year. So there's 4 of them. Okay.

217
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:44.420
Anthony Taylor: so what we're going to do is put those 4 options in a list so that we can present these to our user

218
00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:49.530
Anthony Taylor: and let them select which one they want to use.

219
00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:50.950
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

220
00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:56.299
Anthony Taylor: alright. So let's create that list.

221
00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.910
Anthony Taylor: Okay,

222
00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:10.319
Anthony Taylor: I was looking to see.

223
00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:15.539
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, we don't need to do that alright. So what we're gonna do is we're going to

224
00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.380
Anthony Taylor: ask user

225
00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:30.999
Anthony Taylor: what they want. So we're going to create. Let's just create like a separate variable for the question. This is a good practice, because it kind of makes it obvious with questionnaires. And we could make it a variable. So we'll say, what type of data

226
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:34.850
Anthony Taylor: would you like to search for?

227
00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:43.480
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then we're going to do we're going to. We'll you know what we'll do. Here's what we'll do.

228
00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:50.840
Anthony Taylor: Don't close the parentheses yet, do, plus STR. And let's pass in that cool list

229
00:21:50.920 --> 00:22:02.770
Anthony Taylor: that we just made. Okay? And then after that, we'll do plus and do a new life. Okay? So this backslash in.

230
00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:04.239
Anthony Taylor: we'll make a new line.

231
00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.600
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

232
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:15.080
Anthony Taylor:  so there's our question.  so

233
00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:21.590
Anthony Taylor: this is this, this, this stuff is weird. So let's do kind of search.

234
00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:27.720
Anthony Taylor: So this will be what they want. Date, trivia, math year, etc.

235
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:28.980
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

236
00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.929
Anthony Taylor: will equal input, wow, that was amazing.

237
00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:42.130
Anthony Taylor: Input and we're going to pass in the question. okay, so let's just test this right now. So let's do print

238
00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:51.159
Anthony Taylor: kind of search. And let's just run this cell. So it's going to come up. And it says, what type of data would you like? Trivia math, date, year

239
00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:56.049
Anthony Taylor: press enter to confirm. So we'll say math. and we'll hit, enter.

240
00:22:56.210 --> 00:23:00.829
Anthony Taylor: and then this will print out math. They see what we did. Cool.

241
00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:04.650
Anthony Taylor: Okay. alright,

242
00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:08.600
Anthony Taylor: So now that we have this.

243
00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:13.270
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna move this down a little bit, we're gonna create

244
00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.730
Anthony Taylor: a condition.

245
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:17.360
Anthony Taylor: We're going to say, if

246
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:27.860
Anthony Taylor: kind of search is in our search options. what does that mean? Why are we checking?

247
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:34.450
Dipinto, Matt: They answered it all from the list.

248
00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:38.580
sonja baro: Yeah, but we didn't. Something that wasn't a valid.

249
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:43.530
Anthony Taylor: We didn't want them to type up right? They type the bob. We don't know what to do with Bob.

250
00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:47.800
Anthony Taylor: What about Bob? I don't know. Okay, so

251
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:50.110
Anthony Taylor: we have to check that first.

252
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:57.660
Anthony Taylor: After we check that we need to see, we need to start figuring out what it is. Okay? And actually here.

253
00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:59.510
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna move

254
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:05.470
Anthony Taylor: this. So there. Here's what the comments start making sense. So if the kind is date.

255
00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:12.710
Anthony Taylor: We have to get 2 numbers right? We get month and day. So first, we need to check

256
00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:15.150
Anthony Taylor: if kind of search

257
00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:17.130
equals equals

258
00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:18.330
Anthony Taylor: dates.

259
00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:28.820
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if that's the case. then we need to ask for 2 numbers. Alright so

260
00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:36.859
Anthony Taylor:  I know why that would mean oh, I see.

261
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:42.950
Anthony Taylor: So what we'll do to do this is, we'll create a little loop. Be kind of fun.

262
00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:49.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So inside of our if but while Loop, that's funny while true.

263
00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:52.799
Anthony Taylor: Now, that's a little scary. Why is that scary?

264
00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:56.600
Dipinto, Matt: It was again wrong. It's true.

265
00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.919
Anthony Taylor: It could run forever if we screwed up and hit run right now we'd have to kill everything.

266
00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:04.519
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we're gonna say, wild through.

267
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:10.120
Anthony Taylor: Let's ask for the month. Equals input. what

268
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:12.930
Anthony Taylor: month would you like

269
00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:16.710
Anthony Taylor: to search for it?

270
00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:20.640
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we get our month.

271
00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:21.850
Anthony Taylor: then

272
00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:28.850
Anthony Taylor: we need to check it. And this is why this gets kind of interesting. And while we're why we're doing this loop.

273
00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:30.459
Anthony Taylor: so what we're going to say

274
00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:37.930
Anthony Taylor: is is, I mean, we need to realize, I mean, what's a valid month number is, it's an integer we're looking for.

275
00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:46.190
Anthony Taylor: So we need to check if it's valid. So we're going to say, if not month.is digit.

276
00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:56.870
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this is a new function. I believe. I don't think we covered this. But basically, all it's going to do is if it's an actual number, it will return

277
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.800
Anthony Taylor: true.

278
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:00.870
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

279
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:04.600
Anthony Taylor: So we're saying, if it's not

280
00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:05.950
Anthony Taylor: true.

281
00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.050
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

282
00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:10.910
Anthony Taylor: then we're gonna say.

283
00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:12.140
Anthony Taylor: friends.

284
00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.130
Anthony Taylor: month input is not valid.

285
00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:19.690
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

286
00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:22.249
Anthony Taylor: And then tell them what it should be.

287
00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:34.010
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

288
00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.590
Anthony Taylor: So now we've checked it.

289
00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:42.269
Anthony Taylor: If they mess it up right, we're gonna do that. But what if it's 14?

290
00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.310
Anthony Taylor: Oh, boy, we're not done yet, then, are we?

291
00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:50.380
Anthony Taylor: So now we need to check and see if this is

292
00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.210
Anthony Taylor: a valid

293
00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:58.509
Anthony Taylor: item. So we're going to say, not in range

294
00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:03.170
Anthony Taylor: one comma 13. Yes, Sir Garrett.

295
00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:08.840
Derek Rikke: could you make a list that's just numbers one through 12

296
00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:10.429
Derek Rikke: and do not in

297
00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:12.210
Derek Rikke: check it. Yeah, do not in.

298
00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:17.879
Anthony Taylor: I like that. Yeah, of course you could. I mean, I don't know that that's faster than than this.

299
00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:22.360
Anthony Taylor: but I mean because you still would have to check and give it a digit.

300
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:29.800
Anthony Taylor: I mean well, no cause. If it wasn't a digit it wouldn't be in that list. But then you could say the same thing here.

301
00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:31.970
Anthony Taylor: But then this int would fail.

302
00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:39.009
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, it's not a bad, you know what? Here's the cool thing. And I want you guys to always remember this.

303
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:48.710
Anthony Taylor: we show you a way to solve this problem. So unless I tell you this is the best way to solve this problem.

304
00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:52.920
Anthony Taylor: then assume there are other ways that could be done. It may be better, and they may not be

305
00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:58.960
Anthony Taylor: all right if we, if we were doing like spark or some of the email stuff, I will tell you

306
00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.150
Anthony Taylor: this is the way you should do it

307
00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.589
Anthony Taylor: doesn't mean there's not other ways to do it.

308
00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:10.120
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So Derek's suggestion, I think, is actually pretty valid. We could explore it if we wanted to.

309
00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:14.090
Anthony Taylor: Right? We're gonna use the same

310
00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.049
Anthony Taylor: statement here

311
00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.340
Anthony Taylor: if they don't do it. Okay?

312
00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:22.670
Anthony Taylor: And then

313
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:26.099
Anthony Taylor: we're going to say, else.

314
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.399
Anthony Taylor: What needs to happen.

315
00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:39.590
Mason, Natalie: friend? Months?

316
00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:45.410
Mason, Natalie: Well, we got month right if we got to here. Month is a good value. So what what do we need to do.

317
00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:50.220
Gebrekristos, Hafton: It's not obvious.

318
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:51.430
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Have to

319
00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:54.800
Gebrekristos, Hafton: invalid months

320
00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:57.240
Gebrekristos, Hafton: or break

321
00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:02.080
Anthony Taylor: break. There you go. So basically, we need to get out of this loop

322
00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:04.820
Anthony Taylor: right? We're in this loop.

323
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:07.819
Anthony Taylor: So so, guys, if it does this.

324
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.780
Gebrekristos, Hafton: oh, and then you can call it okay.

325
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:16.030
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So if this, if this says, if it if it runs this print.

326
00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:34.170
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this this, if condition is over and we're in a loop. So what's it going to do? It's going to go back up to year and ask you again if this one runs, it's going to go back up to here and ask you again, and it's going to keep asking you until these 2 conditions are met.

327
00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.309
Anthony Taylor: and then it's going to break out

328
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:40.220
Anthony Taylor: alright. Now.

329
00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:43.310
Anthony Taylor: we need to do same thing for day.

330
00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:53.480
sonja baro: Okay? So, Anthony, yeah, would you have to do the same kind of error handling like if they gave you

331
00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:55.869
sonja baro: something that isn't a digit?

332
00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:11.099
sonja baro: II know, we put in. Hey, put this in right. It has to be a number. So I guess that would handle the somebody putting in Ma, y, like, right? So right here, yeah, this would say, if they put like, May, it's gonna say, no, make it enough.

333
00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:13.320
sonja baro: Yeah, okay.

334
00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:20.840
Anthony Taylor: And just so you guys know, there's actually some pretty clever ways that you could like, map it just using 2 lists. But we're not

335
00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:22.469
sonja baro: okay. Okay.

336
00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:29.190
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. You could map it to say, Hey, if they say may just put 5. Okay, or you could use a date time library.

337
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:33.670
Anthony Taylor: and just say, Tell, give me the month for May, and then I'll give it to you.

338
00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:34.600
Anthony Taylor: But

339
00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.839
Anthony Taylor: we're not going to fall. We're not gonna

340
00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:43.309
Anthony Taylor: okay. So for today, I'm gonna say what I'm gonna just copy what I do. We just did

341
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:45.709
Anthony Taylor: change a couple of things.

342
00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:49.230
Anthony Taylor: Now for the

343
00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:56.319
Anthony Taylor: is digit. And we we went through 31, okay, not one through 12.

344
00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:03.080
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And then this is the day. So since we're doing

345
00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:06.450
Anthony Taylor: a range, since I need one through 31, what range am I going to do?

346
00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:10.520
sonja baro: One to 32,

347
00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:17.599
Anthony Taylor: 32 nicely. Say, there you go. So now we have a month and our day.

348
00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:29.650
Anthony Taylor: That's pretty exciting. Right? Okay. But we're still in this. Is it a date? Okay. So now we need to make our Api call.

349
00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:34.140
Anthony Taylor: okay. So here we're going to say.

350
00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.980
Response, yeah, Brandon.

351
00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:50.269
Mckimmy, Brandon: How is that going to work? If the month is 30 days, or every 4 years, we have a leave view between 9. III knew someone was going to ask that question, and I'm proud of you for asking.

352
00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.980
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And the answer is.

353
00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:58.640
Anthony Taylor: it's just gonna the the Api call will return an error. We didn't actually test for that.

354
00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:01.610
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But it's a good question.

355
00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:05.139
Anthony Taylor: And it is something that if you really writing this out

356
00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:09.889
Anthony Taylor: right, I would expect that you guys would would do that. Not in your activities.

357
00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:11.060
Anthony Taylor: Brandon.

358
00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:20.189
Anthony Taylor: I know you're gonna be like, I wanna do that. No. okay. So what are we going to pass in? We're gonna pass in our yeah. URL, which we did here.

359
00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.309
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're gonna pass in

360
00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:26.029
Anthony Taylor: and and make sure it ends with, oh, it doesn't end with a slash.

361
00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:28.970
That's funny.

362
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:31.520
Anthony Taylor: Did I just not do it right?

363
00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:36.109
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, go back up here and end this with a slash.

364
00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:37.150
Anthony Taylor: just

365
00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:40.230
Anthony Taylor: for sanity's sake.

366
00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:43.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we need to pass in our yeah, URL.

367
00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:47.330
Anthony Taylor: And then we're gonna pass in.

368
00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:53.330
Anthony Taylor: But we might need to go look at the the site again. What does it take? Which order month or day. First

369
00:32:56.070 --> 00:33:04.600
Anthony Taylor: we're doing this one so definitely month. First. right? So we'll pass in month.

370
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.540
Anthony Taylor: and

371
00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:13.199
Anthony Taylor: then we'll pass a slash. and then day.

372
00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:17.940
Anthony Taylor: and then a slash. The word

373
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:19.080
Anthony Taylor: date.

374
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:28.860
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And probably a size. Okay? And remember, we we do want.

375
00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:36.349
Anthony Taylor: well, actually, let's let's keep this programmatic. So we. We know we have this in a variable. So we can do

376
00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:39.779
Anthony Taylor: kind of search.

377
00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:46.140
Anthony Taylor: Let's make sure. We lower case it. Okay? And that's that.

378
00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:52.029
Anthony Taylor: And then remember, at the end of all of this, we need to do. Get rid of that slash

379
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:57.239
Anthony Taylor: question. Mark Json, as we want it in Json format.

380
00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:01.099
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then we're gonna print

381
00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:04.230
Anthony Taylor: response.

382
00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.260
Anthony Taylor: Now, we can actually test from here.

383
00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:13.340
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we can test this right now. So we can run this.

384
00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.220
Anthony Taylor: Just remember to say date.

385
00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:28.400
Anthony Taylor: It's gonna say, what month? Let's do. February. what day? 20 s. And then if we go down and look. we got an answer.

386
00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:32.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay. this is getting kinda cool, right?

387
00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:35.900
Anthony Taylor: Alright. But what if it's something else?

388
00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:40.169
Anthony Taylor: What if they don't say date? So now we're gonna do.

389
00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:43.480
Anthony Taylor: and else. Now do note

390
00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:49.100
Anthony Taylor: that we're trying. We have to make sure we're on the right level. So am I on the right level right now.

391
00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:55.220
Anthony Taylor: and not right. I need to tab in one.

392
00:34:56.449 --> 00:35:00.280
Anthony Taylor: Does everybody see that? Look at what the first one is?

393
00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:06.409
Anthony Taylor: First one? Is, is it one of the options that if we're working on right now, is this one.

394
00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:13.880
Anthony Taylor: So I need to tab in one so that I'm on the same as this one. Yes, Sunny.

395
00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:30.219
sonja baro: So, Anthony. The prompts that we have all in here was this part of the Api description that said, Hey, if you're gonna build it, these are the things to ask, or is it simply we're.

396
00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:41.050
Anthony Taylor: I mean. So here's the prompt, right? Here's the idea. Right? Month, day date.

397
00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:45.579
sonja baro: Okay? So we're just building an app to get this information.

398
00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:50.989
sonja baro: So it's anything that we want knowing that

399
00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:53.830
sonja baro: we're gonna access information about a date

400
00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:55.310
Anthony Taylor: correct.

401
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:59.879
Anthony Taylor: you could put anything in. Yeah. But in the end you want month, day, date.

402
00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:25.029
sonja baro: and then the thing I'm trying to my face you'll probably see as are you going through. I don't know if you're seeing it, but others I'm sure do is I'm trying to figure out like how you know. Well, you know all this, but like, how am I supposed to know all the commands that you're like, you know. Just do. Okay. Which which commands? Are you questioning the Re the Api call itself, or all of this stuff up here.

403
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:36.230
sonja baro: No, the loops I get, because we've done that right. We've done. Yeah, no, but some of them like the question, mark Jason or Jason. I don't.

404
00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:41.189
sonja baro: Yeah.

405
00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:53.239
sonja baro: right? Right? I'm just. I'm sorry. I guess it's really not a question. Now, it's an excellent question. So let me show you

406
00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:59.530
Anthony Taylor: so the the interesting thing is the numbers. Api, while it's a wonderful Api.

407
00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:03.050
Anthony Taylor: Okay. their documentation is a little awe.

408
00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:09.139
Anthony Taylor: But they're they're fairly clear that, you know. Here's how you're gonna call.

409
00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:15.810
Anthony Taylor: You're going to pass in a number you're going to pass in a type unless it's a date, and you're going to pass in 2 numbers and a type.

410
00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:22.219
sonja baro: Okay, now define the whole Json thing. You actually have to kind of scroll down a bit

411
00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:25.510
Anthony Taylor: and you can go. Oh, there's actually fragments.

412
00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.979
Anthony Taylor: which is interesting. But

413
00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:30.760
Anthony Taylor: if you keep going.

414
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:35.590
sonja baro: will eventually see

415
00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:39.059
Anthony Taylor: this. And see here. And this is where it tells you what to do.

416
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:52.249
Anthony Taylor: Right? So include the query parameter. Remember, we talked about these yesterday. Alright. yeah, Json, and that's it. So you add this question, Mark Jason. And then, you know. Now

417
00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:56.689
Anthony Taylor: let's be realistic for a second. If you guys were doing this work

418
00:37:58.650 --> 00:37:59.610
Anthony Taylor: and

419
00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:04.379
Anthony Taylor: I wasn't here walking you through it, you might do it without that.

420
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:08.739
Anthony Taylor: Okay, in fact. we can run it this way.

421
00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:14.250
Anthony Taylor: Right? You're gonna run this. It's gonna oh, what did I do? Oh.

422
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:16.070
Anthony Taylor: I broke it. 1 s.

423
00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:25.520
Anthony Taylor: we're going to run this. And we're going to say date. And we're gonna say, 12, 25.

424
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:29.360
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now, notice what came back this time.

425
00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:32.060
Anthony Taylor: It's still the fact.

426
00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:45.960
Anthony Taylor: But now it's just a single line. It's a text straight. So at this point you go. Fred, I need to make this into something I can work with in python. and maybe this is enough, depending on what you're trying to do. But

427
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:48.960
Anthony Taylor: you wouldn't be able to like. Call this out something.

428
00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:57.579
Anthony Taylor: So this is where you would go. All right. I need to return this in a different format. Go look at the documentation and find out.

429
00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:01.489
Anthony Taylor: I don't know if that helps a time. But

430
00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:09.010
Anthony Taylor: those kind of things I mean, you just need to know that what you're wanting most of the time from your Api call is Json.

431
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:17.160
Anthony Taylor: So look at the documentation and see. And we're going to look at some other ones today. So maybe you'll have some opportunities to try that there as well.

432
00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:21.269
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. So if it's not a date, what do we need?

433
00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:26.679
Anthony Taylor: Okay, well, we're gonna do another loop because we need a number.

434
00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:31.879
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna validate. If they give us a number. First, we gotta ask for it

435
00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:38.249
Anthony Taylor: equals input. And what number would you?

436
00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.250
Anthony Taylor: Hi. okay.

437
00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:48.390
Anthony Taylor: And once they give it to us. we're going to say if.

438
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:54.440
Anthony Taylor: And the first thing we're do is check and see if it's. And actually a number. Which is that cool is digit.

439
00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:59.489
Anthony Taylor: Okay? If it is, we're done, we can get out of here.

440
00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:06.119
Anthony Taylor: Okay. if it's not. we're simply going to say.

441
00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:12.590
Anthony Taylor:  please enter a number here. Dimwit.

442
00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

443
00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:20.199
Anthony Taylor: okay. Then, when we get the number.

444
00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:23.330
Anthony Taylor: we're going to do this same call

445
00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:32.649
Anthony Taylor: outside. So even with the else our note tab from the else.

446
00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:34.070
Anthony Taylor: Oh, wait.

447
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:36.770
yeah, add from the else.

448
00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:41.089
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna we all we need is the number

449
00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:43.129
Anthony Taylor: we don't need all this other stuff.

450
00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:48.210
Anthony Taylor: Then we need what kind of search? And then, Json.

451
00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:50.900
Anthony Taylor: okay?

452
00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:54.889
Anthony Taylor: And we could.

453
00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:56.799
Anthony Taylor: we could go ahead

454
00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:58.650
Anthony Taylor: and prints.

455
00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:05.070
Anthony Taylor: We'll print on both of these. Oh, we did. We printed it there. Let's do the same print here.

456
00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:11.080
Anthony Taylor: there we go.

457
00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:15.229
Anthony Taylor: and that, my friends, is the whole program.

458
00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:21.669
Anthony Taylor: So if we run that again. Now we can do anything. So let's do, trivia.

459
00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:27.009
Anthony Taylor: What number would you like? Let's put in a word. Dude!

460
00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:32.859
Anthony Taylor: And then it says whatever. Oh, it didn't fail properly. Darn it! So it just broke right back.

461
00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:36.750
Anthony Taylor:  so let's do. I don't know.

462
00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:39.900
Anthony Taylor: 42, and

463
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:45.669
Anthony Taylor: please enter a number you did with. Oh, set it down there! That's fine!

464
00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:49.420
Anthony Taylor: 42, is the answer to the ultimate question. Oh,

465
00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:51.450
Anthony Taylor: Remember to break.

466
00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:54.269
Anthony Taylor: You'll never get to this. But where

467
00:41:54.340 --> 00:42:02.270
Anthony Taylor: is the alternative? Question? Life, universe and everything. Okay. And that's it pretty cool.

468
00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:11.789
Anthony Taylor: What do you guys think was that fun? Did you did you follow? Mostly I do understand your question, Sonya, and it's really going to come down to as you use Apis. And

469
00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:16.529
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna be honest with you. The bane of my existence is api documentation.

470
00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.809
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it is rarely consistent.

471
00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:23.870
Anthony Taylor: It doesn't follow any specific pattern.

472
00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:28.480
Anthony Taylor: and it all is dependent on the company that writes it.

473
00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:32.160
Anthony Taylor: Okay, just as an example.

474
00:42:34.410 --> 00:42:45.620
Anthony Taylor: Let's look up salesforce. How many of you guys work with salesforce? Yeah. Api documentation.

475
00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:50.659
Anthony Taylor: Okay? It certainly is out there.

476
00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:52.060
Anthony Taylor: Here it is.

477
00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:55.520
Anthony Taylor: And yeah

478
00:42:55.530 --> 00:43:01.599
Anthony Taylor: get started. And I mean, it looks good. It's like, Oh, well, look, they got examples.

479
00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:05.829
Anthony Taylor: It's great. Where's the actual stuff at. Oh, here's some quick starts.

480
00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:12.660
Anthony Taylor: Oh, that's if you're using a specific client are using curl. Okay.

481
00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:16.319
Anthony Taylor: yeah. So this is like the documentation

482
00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:19.790
Anthony Taylor: alright. If you want specific objects.

483
00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:30.799
Anthony Taylor: Here's how you do it. So you look at this. And it's like, Oh, my God, that looks crazy, right? It's it just takes time. It just takes time.

484
00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:33.539
Anthony Taylor: you will learn all of it.

485
00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:46.680
Anthony Taylor: So is that something I've never used salesforce, but I think it like companies use it to house sales information and whatnot. So is that is that documentation basically saying, like, if you wanted to pull the data about all of your

486
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:57.929
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Xyz clients from 1980 or something. It is basically giving you the code for like how to go pull it up. Then you have to figure that out yourself. Absolutely.

487
00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:04.429
Anthony Taylor: That's it. You have to know what you're looking for. And then you come in here and you start.

488
00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:08.530
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, II run this. I do this now. I will give you guys a little kid.

489
00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:20.160
Anthony Taylor: Github is wonderful place. Okay? But if you say  query salesforce

490
00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:27.619
Anthony Taylor: with an a Our query, salesforce Api just in Google. Let's see if it shows up.

491
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:31.720
Anthony Taylor: See it. It's not showing up

492
00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:34.100
Anthony Taylor: initially.

493
00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:36.680
Anthony Taylor: But go to Github.

494
00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:40.690
Anthony Taylor: This is just a tip, all right. Here's a pro tip.

495
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.730
Anthony Taylor: you know. Yeah, how many of you guys read Dummy's books?

496
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:51.320
Anthony Taylor: I love Dummy's books. Okay, they're my favorite. If I'm going to read a paper book. That's the book I'm going to read.

497
00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:52.520
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

498
00:44:52.630 --> 00:45:01.719
Anthony Taylor: And they have like little things like pro tip. And this is one of those pro tip where you would want to actually write down what I'm saying.

499
00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:05.859
Anthony Taylor: But if you come in here and say Salesforce

500
00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:11.680
Anthony Taylor: Api, it's very likely someone has written code

501
00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:16.580
Anthony Taylor: to do this and then left it there and get up for people to see.

502
00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:19.890
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this one

503
00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:26.380
Anthony Taylor: is actually an entire framework

504
00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:32.149
Anthony Taylor: on how to pull salesforce data. And it is brain dead simple.

505
00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:37.770
Anthony Taylor: and I use it every day. Freaking, awesome.

506
00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:42.929
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And all it took was, go to Github and do a quick search.

507
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.790
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Lots of stuff out there.

508
00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:51.200
Anthony Taylor: whatever you do, don't search for your challenges.

509
00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:56.589
sonja baro: Yeah. So, Meredith, actually, you know, it's funny.

510
00:45:56.650 --> 00:46:00.630
Anthony Taylor: I will tell you. This will tell you this, because for you guys, it won't work

511
00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:06.490
Anthony Taylor: if you do like. what's what's the name of one of your challenges? You've already done that they tell you, to make

512
00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:09.480
Anthony Taylor: your Github repo.

513
00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:11.579
Mckimmy, Brandon: And so banking.

514
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:15.910
Anthony Taylor: So I'm sorry too many people, said Brandon. Go ahead.

515
00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:20.599
Mckimmy, Brandon: The customer banking one banking

516
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.370
Mckimmy, Brandon: customer underscore banking. What's the name of the web we had to make?

517
00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:30.890
Anthony Taylor: Okay, customer underscore banking

518
00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:38.739
Anthony Taylor: you might have to search for quite a while, cause there's 2.1,000.

519
00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:49.789
Anthony Taylor: Okay, Repos, with a similar name. But the bottom line is is all of you students have to make them public. So guess what they are searchable and findable.

520
00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:56.089
Anthony Taylor: Alright, I'm not too worried about you guys, because this is the first day I course. So

521
00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:59.669
Anthony Taylor: it's unlikely you're gonna find me.

522
00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:01.810
Anthony Taylor: But

523
00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:08.510
Anthony Taylor: like my data classes, if they ever figure that out, you know. But our I will tell you. Our plagiarism checker

524
00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:13.009
Anthony Taylor: will probably catch it if you just copy. So don't just copy.

525
00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.609
Anthony Taylor: Okay, anyway.

526
00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:18.780
Anthony Taylor: that's it ready to move on.

527
00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:31.569
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I have another question about that. Go for it. So what's the. So if you can do, if you can do use Apis like this to get your data out of wherever it's living.

528
00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:36.500
Meredith McCanse (she/her): why do people need like data, warehouses and data lakes and stuff like that.

529
00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:40.729
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Great question, Meredith. I love that question.

530
00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:47.360
Anthony Taylor: And I'll tell you why Apis are really really cool at giving you small amounts of data.

531
00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:50.630
Anthony Taylor: And that's the answer.

532
00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:56.189
Anthony Taylor: That is, if you need all of your data, you got to do something else.

533
00:47:56.530 --> 00:48:01.020
Anthony Taylor: Well, using that, that not salesforce, but a different one I was working on today.

534
00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:05.099
The Api only allows you to pull 200 rows at a time.

535
00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:12.459
Anthony Taylor: and then it gives you in the results. It gives you a little token that you go back and call for the next 200 groups.

536
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:16.979
Anthony Taylor: Well, in this one table there were 21,000 rows, which is really small.

537
00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:22.880
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And it took probably 10 min to get those 21,000 ups.

538
00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:31.220
Anthony Taylor: Now, if that was stored in database. It would take a millisecond query, those 21,000 books. plus. You can't join

539
00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:43.699
Anthony Taylor: the Api data to other data unless you are storing. Now you could write it directly in data frame, join it to another table and then output it. But then you don't have it every time you'd have to go back to the Api.

540
00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:50.840
Anthony Taylor: Also, if you're connected, Api's are going over the Internet Internet is anything but reliable.

541
00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:57.660
Anthony Taylor: We don't feel that so much. I do remember when it was like, Oh, damn no Internet today.

542
00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:05.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay, these days. We don't get that too often, but it's still it could be slow. It could be intermittent.

543
00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:07.540
It could be routing you through.

544
00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:11.870
Anthony Taylor: you know, another country, for all you know, you have no idea. So anyway.

545
00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:14.110
Anthony Taylor: Apis are fantastic

546
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:22.609
Anthony Taylor: for getting data from systems where we can't access their database. But a database will always be better.

547
00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:23.650
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay.

548
00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:28.260
Anthony Taylor: okay, if you can get to their database, I guarantee you. It's gonna be better.

549
00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:32.390
Anthony Taylor: But most of the time they don't let you get to the games. Applications don't.

550
00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.480
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yeah, okay.

551
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:41.719
Anthony Taylor: That was that was a great. II love that question because it makes me talk about something that I love. And so here.

552
00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:45.320
Anthony Taylor: data. okay.

553
00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:47.620
Anthony Taylor: so slideshow.

554
00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:52.850
Anthony Taylor: that's not the slide show. That's the numbers. Api. We are done with the numbers Api

555
00:49:56.080 --> 00:50:01.400
Anthony Taylor: Api keys. So since we all spent the first part of the class

556
00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:06.510
Anthony Taylor: getting our Api keys, let's make sure we understand what they are.

557
00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:13.220
Anthony Taylor: What are they? Well. new York Times says you are welcome to query my data.

558
00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:18.779
Anthony Taylor: but we want to know who you are.

559
00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.390
Anthony Taylor: and that's it.

560
00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:31.849
Anthony Taylor: The Api key you registered. And then you asked for an Api key. So you run a query on their data. and they're gonna know that

561
00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:35.129
Anthony Taylor: Clayton did it because his Api key was used.

562
00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:40.720
Anthony Taylor: Now they may limit. They may say you can't run, you know, 100,000 records a minute.

563
00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:43.900
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but

564
00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:45.790
Anthony Taylor: they

565
00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:55.619
Anthony Taylor: you know that this is how they do it. This is just how they ensure. They know who see it in their data open weather, same thing. But weather has some limits.

566
00:50:56.310 --> 00:51:04.159
Anthony Taylor: I don't know if TM. dB does. Tmdb is basically the IM, just somebody made an Api to call. That's all.

567
00:51:05.050 --> 00:51:08.929
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So an Api key is just a method

568
00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:11.370
Anthony Taylor: to access an Api.

569
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:15.320
Anthony Taylor: Oh.

570
00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:28.880
Anthony Taylor: secure, do you think it is? I mean, let's think about what's happened. You put it into a yeah. URL, most of the time. Okay, well, some of the time. And

571
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:33.460
Anthony Taylor: you're sending it over the Internet. You guys think that's pretty secure.

572
00:51:34.690 --> 00:51:39.419
Anthony Taylor: Anybody think that's a good for the record that's totally not secure.

573
00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:43.139
Anthony Taylor: Go ahead, Eric.

574
00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:51.249
Meredith McCanse (she/her): but you have a unique key number. When you get it right. You do. But once you send it over the Internet, anyone that can see

575
00:51:51.310 --> 00:51:53.540
Anthony Taylor: the traffic will see that kingdom.

576
00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:55.770
Meredith McCanse (she/her): and then they could be you.

577
00:51:56.140 --> 00:52:00.759
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now, there are absolutely ways to encrypt it. And

578
00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:06.829
again, you know, we were talking the other day about I mentioned you about authentication.

579
00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:14.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay, authentication is where you have. You basically have a key that you use to get another key.

580
00:52:15.930 --> 00:52:22.010
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then that tends to be an encrypted key. which is only good for a very short amount of time.

581
00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:25.770
Anthony Taylor: These keys we got today. They're good until you delete.

582
00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:31.549
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Unless they said they had a time to live. But

583
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:49.400
Anthony Taylor: alright, so don't worry about it. These are all free sites, anyway. No one's gonna sneak your key and charge you money. The worst that could happen is, if you wrote like an app that used open weather, and someone else used your key and hit it like 10,000 times. You'd probably be locked out for the rest of it.

584
00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:55.049
Anthony Taylor: and have to wait till the next day to to do anything. That's about the worst thing that can happen.

585
00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:56.320
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

586
00:52:57.790 --> 00:53:03.250
Anthony Taylor: So companies use them as a means to secure. That's pretty much it. It's really

587
00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:15.859
Anthony Taylor: it. The when they say that, like the Api keys we got today. Like I said, they're really more of to track. Okay, they're not so much security. Because again, they're really easy to get

588
00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:24.300
Anthony Taylor:  But Api teachers in general can be fairly elaborate. Getting them can be fairly elaborate.

589
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:28.959
Anthony Taylor: It's often probably the biggest

590
00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:38.490
Anthony Taylor: challenge when using Apis is getting authenticated. Once you get authenticated most times. They're pretty straightforward.

591
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:40.480
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

592
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:43.390
Anthony Taylor: alright. So we're going to.

593
00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:48.179
Anthony Taylor: We've never. I've never had to do this before, but it's pretty cool.

594
00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:55.159
Anthony Taylor: It is a neat thing to do in the cloud. We don't do it this way. In the cloud, we have what's called a key vault.

595
00:53:56.180 --> 00:54:07.169
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Which is a secure environment that, like only Admins can get to. And we give you a function. And if and give you permissions to access the key

596
00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:13.899
Anthony Taylor: right? And then you call that function. You give it the key name, and if you have permission, you get the value of T,

597
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.970
Anthony Taylor: okay.

598
00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:19.360
Anthony Taylor: what they're talking about here is if you write a program

599
00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:25.710
Anthony Taylor: locally on your computer, you can save the values in an environment variable.

600
00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:27.890
Anthony Taylor: An environment variable is

601
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:32.030
Anthony Taylor: just a variable. That is that your OS has access to.

602
00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:33.850
Anthony Taylor: That's it.

603
00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:38.870
Anthony Taylor: All right, we're gonna learn how to do this and access this with iphone.

604
00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:40.450
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

605
00:54:41.590 --> 00:54:49.710
Anthony Taylor:  so kind of interesting things, an environment variable that python creates. You can't see it with a terminal

606
00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:53.399
Anthony Taylor: if you create it with a terminal iphone can see it.

607
00:54:54.130 --> 00:54:58.290
Anthony Taylor: I don't know why. That's the big deal, but they want me to tell you. Alright.

608
00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:14.379
Anthony Taylor:  the one good thing about doing it with python is the operating system that's independent. It doesn't care. Which is why from terminal you can't see it.

609
00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:20.690
Anthony Taylor: Does that make sense? Python makes it in a way that python can see and is happy with it.

610
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:25.160
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if you if you do it with a terminal.

611
00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:30.960
Anthony Taylor: it does it. So the OS can see. but not it doesn't work both ways.

612
00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:34.039
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So let's look at this.

613
00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:41.309
Anthony Taylor: This is kind of fun. So first off, this is an example. Ed, file, this is what we're going to store.

614
00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:43.600
Anthony Taylor: Are environment variables in

615
00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:47.160
Anthony Taylor: okay? And this is all it looks like.

616
00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:51.550
Anthony Taylor: name of the environment, variable equals

617
00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:59.789
Anthony Taylor: the value that you have. Okay. So don't copy this one yet. We're gonna do one in just a second with all of your key.

618
00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:01.980
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

619
00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:06.059
Anthony Taylor: so let's go to oh, 3, and look at

620
00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:08.380
Anthony Taylor: the instructor demo here.

621
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:14.240
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So first off everybody run this first, though, and let's make sure everybody has this.

622
00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:20.290
Anthony Taylor: I think I stopped somebody from doing this yesterday.

623
00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:25.620
Anthony Taylor: Did it work

624
00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:35.819
Anthony Taylor: any problems. I don't have a dot environment, is it? Just Pip install board is yeah, pip install from Daddy and the are just Dottie and be site.

625
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:38.009
Anthony Taylor: and and probably well, you know.

626
00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:40.560
Anthony Taylor: Sorry

627
00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:47.900
Meredith McCanse (she/her): if that first cell gets you an error message that you what's this is the same module not found.

628
00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:54.729
Anthony Taylor: No, actually, it ran fine. I got the green check mark so

629
00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:58.520
Anthony Taylor: awesome. All right.

630
00:56:58.570 --> 00:57:00.409
Anthony Taylor: Matt's on it. He'll be fine.

631
00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:02.250
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so

632
00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:08.080
Anthony Taylor: low.

633
00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:10.490
Anthony Taylor: This function

634
00:57:11.310 --> 00:57:14.900
Anthony Taylor: and every single notebook has no argument in it.

635
00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:18.200
Anthony Taylor: The way that would work

636
00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:21.700
Anthony Taylor: is if this environment file

637
00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:24.770
Anthony Taylor: was where your python was installed.

638
00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:27.839
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're not gonna do that.

639
00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:34.940
Anthony Taylor: That would drive us all crazy. Okay, so what we're gonna do is we're gonna make sure we copy

640
00:57:35.010 --> 00:57:43.360
Anthony Taylor: this file to each of our folders as we go. And actually. we're gonna make a file like this.

641
00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:48.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so go ahead and and open or create

642
00:57:48.860 --> 00:58:00.840
Anthony Taylor: example, dot embry. And I want you guys, this is where you're going to go. Get those keys that you cop that you pasted you saved. and you're gonna make a key for each one. If you use these same names.

643
00:58:00.850 --> 00:58:08.129
Anthony Taylor: Then the solutions that I give you later will all work. If you don't use these names well, you'll have to make a test.

644
00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:10.909
Raugewitz, Tania: That's why they give you these names.

645
00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:23.540
Raugewitz, Tania: Go ahead. Sorry. Well, in Module 6. It has this. Do that. Put all of our keys in, and then renamed the example.

646
00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:30.799
Raugewitz, Tania: So if someone's already done that is that is that, yeah, you've already done it. Yeah, please just copy and paste it into this one

647
00:58:30.890 --> 00:58:35.449
Anthony Taylor: cause. Basically, we're gonna take the same file. And we're gonna put it in every folder.

648
00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:47.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay? I mean, it seems silly. But trying to put it where your python installed for a whole class could be very problematic. Okay.

649
00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:52.629
Anthony Taylor: so make sure you save it when you're done.

650
00:58:56.380 --> 00:59:01.419
Anthony Taylor: If those of you that know where your python installed. You want to put it in there. That's fine. Yes, I

651
00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:07.340
Anthony Taylor: sounding. You're muted

652
00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:20.770
sonja baro: sorry I moved you to a different screen, and it was hard to get to the unmute. I'm not seeing the example env in my, that's okay. Just make it.

653
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:25.509
sonja baro: Just go ahead and just click new file and and create it.

654
00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:31.699
sonja baro: Gotcha, and then there's there it is. Time is right. There's more like, if you go down to like

655
00:59:32.250 --> 00:59:37.419
Anthony Taylor: exercise 6 or something. I mean, there's there's you'll see it's in there. It's it's all over.

656
00:59:38.310 --> 00:59:43.340
Sihong Zhou: Yeah, and then move it. You just right. Click and copy.

657
00:59:43.650 --> 00:59:45.519
sonja baro: Not in mind. Sorry, Cindy.

658
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:56.669
Sihong Zhou: Yeah, I do not have the solved, and I do not have the example nobody has to solve. You have solved an instructor. but here, this one up here, O, 2.

659
00:59:57.700 --> 00:59:59.860
Anthony Taylor: There's an everyone has this one. Right?

660
01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:01.030
Sihong Zhou: Yeah.

661
01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:12.469
Anthony Taylor: okay, just copy it and then come down to O, 3. Solve right click and paste, and it'll show up there. But then fill it with those 3 Apis.

662
01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:15.370
Anthony Taylor: You're not mine

663
01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:18.929
sonja baro: in that that structure.

664
01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:25.100
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, just like this. Yeah, preferably. And like, I said, if you guys wanna give you the

665
01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:26.739
Anthony Taylor: the names I'm using here.

666
01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:29.950
sonja baro: I see. Okay, thank you.

667
01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:31.289
Anthony Taylor: No problem.

668
01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:39.890
Anthony Taylor: And the only reason I'm kind of having you guys do this all right now is cause we're going to use this on every exercise.

669
01:00:41.790 --> 01:00:43.800
Anthony Taylor: So I just put it up in my

670
01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:02.600
Anthony Taylor: alright. Let me know when you guys are mostly done with it. Yes, Christine, sorry. Sorry.

671
01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:10.010
Kanouff, Christine: II actually did have an error on that

672
01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:13.360
Kanouff, Christine: the dot AV one.

673
01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:16.839
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so you'll go create a new cell

674
01:01:17.830 --> 01:01:19.820
Anthony Taylor: and type. PIP.

675
01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:24.529
Anthony Taylor: Install DOTE, NB.

676
01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:28.340
Anthony Taylor: And then run that step.

677
01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:32.030
Clayton Graves: I get an error when I do, I'm still on the soccer right now, too.

678
01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:39.239
Kanouff, Christine: Yeah, I'm well, it's doing something. I'm getting this weird sub process. Blah blah blah.

679
01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:47.020
Kanouff, Christine: and it keeps want. It keeps wanting to. Wow, yeah, this is what I'm getting, actually.

680
01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:49.090
Anthony Taylor: huh?

681
01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:51.879
Mason, Natalie: What's showing up on here. So

682
01:01:52.230 --> 01:02:00.870
Anthony Taylor: I have what's shown up on my screen right now. Alright. Well, let's go ask her a little, for actually, I don't think that one's gonna help in this case.

683
01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:02.980
Let's go here

684
01:02:05.890 --> 01:02:07.940
install

685
01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:09.110
Anthony Taylor: the

686
01:02:16.090 --> 01:02:18.559
Anthony Taylor:  try that.

687
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.170
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I'll put it. I'll put it in slack. 1 s.

688
01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:34.329
Anthony Taylor: Try that one. Let's see if that works on mine. I already have it, so I don't. I don't think it's gonna give me a whole lot of info here, but

689
01:02:34.930 --> 01:02:39.549
Dipinto, Matt: so that is the package that's in anacondas library as well. There we go.

690
01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:42.900
Anthony Taylor: Hi! There you go!

691
01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:46.029
Anthony Taylor: Thank you, Matt.

692
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:13.530
Sihong Zhou: Hey, Antony, I have a II why, when I retrieve the key from Tmdb, you'd ask me to

693
01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:20.319
Sihong Zhou: have to kind of of input application. URL, application. Summary.

694
01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:24.689
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. yeah, it's just just student.

695
01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:29.030
Anthony Taylor: you know, learning learning how to use Apis, whatever you want.

696
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:31.600
Sihong Zhou: How about you? RL,

697
01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:35.470
Anthony Taylor: you don't need a URL. Just leave that blank.

698
01:03:35.970 --> 01:03:36.990
Sihong Zhou: Okay.

699
01:03:37.850 --> 01:03:40.060
Anthony Taylor: if it if it insists but

700
01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:44.790
Anthony Taylor: 1 27.0 point 0 point 1. But I don't think it does, because nobody else has to.

701
01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:46.140
Sihong Zhou: Okay.

702
01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:47.760
Anthony Taylor: Yes.

703
01:03:57.060 --> 01:04:00.580
Anthony Taylor: alright. How we do it! Everybody with me. Now.

704
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:06.999
Kanouff, Christine: Christine, how are you doing up there? Well, that that worked? And now I'm just

705
01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:12.169
Kanouff, Christine: behind. We're confused.

706
01:04:12.490 --> 01:04:15.660
Anthony Taylor: Okay, well, let's just make sure all you gotta do right. Now

707
01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:18.250
Anthony Taylor: have these keys set up

708
01:04:18.350 --> 01:04:20.059
Anthony Taylor: in this UV file.

709
01:04:24.970 --> 01:04:31.429
Anthony Taylor: If you don't have the Mv file, just either copy it from above or right. Click, solve and do new file.

710
01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.690
Kanouff, Christine: Yep.

711
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:36.090
Anthony Taylor: okay.

712
01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:39.759
Anthony Taylor: And then, once you get this set up

713
01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:46.680
Kanouff, Christine: and those are just our yeah, use your keys. Don't use mine. I mean, it doesn't matter. But

714
01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:47.730
Kanouff, Christine: yeah.

715
01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:52.909
Anthony Taylor: okay. And then, when you're done, go to O 3 environment variables solution.

716
01:04:54.350 --> 01:04:58.820
Anthony Taylor: And then we already ran the first cell. So we're ready for the next one now

717
01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:01.829
Anthony Taylor: are we? Is everybody with me.

718
01:05:03.090 --> 01:05:10.500
Anthony Taylor: and that's the time to save. Can you go back to that key page? There you go.

719
01:05:10.810 --> 01:05:17.499
Anthony Taylor: I did put the key names in slack. So if you wanna go grab those, so you don't have to worry about miss typing it.

720
01:05:17.610 --> 01:05:19.220
Kanouff, Christine: Perfect!

721
01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:22.890
Kanouff, Christine: There we go.

722
01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:44.640
Anthony Taylor: Hi, how are we doing? Pretty good.

723
01:05:46.650 --> 01:05:48.250
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright.

724
01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:56.570
Anthony Taylor: So I'm gonna go on and move forward. If you as long as you guys have at least one team in there. You should be okay. Actually, you need the movie one. That's the one you need first.

725
01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:05.829
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. So remember, a few minutes ago, I said, you're gonna see this function in every single solution today.

726
01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:11.930
Anthony Taylor: this would work if we put the environment file where our python is.

727
01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:17.620
Anthony Taylor: we're not going to do that. So the way we get around it is, you just have to type the name of

728
01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:19.499
Anthony Taylor: basically, it's the path

729
01:06:20.250 --> 01:06:31.519
Anthony Taylor: your environment file. So we're going to keep putting an environment file with our notebook are near it. So that all we have to do is that okay? Once you do that.

730
01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:37.770
Anthony Taylor: you should see true. true means. I loaded it.

731
01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:41.140
Anthony Taylor: It says false. Something is wrong.

732
01:06:44.130 --> 01:06:45.950
Raugewitz, Tania: I have false and false.

733
01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:46.960
Clayton Graves: most

734
01:06:47.890 --> 01:06:53.340
Anthony Taylor: okay, alright. Which one you want to share your screen. Show me what's up.

735
01:06:53.790 --> 01:06:55.040
Anthony Taylor: Let's find out why.

736
01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:01.590
Anthony Taylor: yeah, Brandon.

737
01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:07.399
Mckimmy, Brandon: I was gonna share the screen, but I was waiting for the

738
01:07:07.410 --> 01:07:09.270
Mckimmy, Brandon: yep, I got false.

739
01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:11.250
Anthony Taylor: Oh, you did call it key environment.

740
01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:15.809
Anthony Taylor: me, too. Wait! Where'd you go, Toni? Who was it that had their screen up?

741
01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:18.670
Clayton Graves: No, that was. I'll put it back up. Hold on.

742
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:24.259
Anthony Taylor: Oh, yeah. Oh, I just need to see it. Cause yeah, it was weird that it did. It didn't work.

743
01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:29.079
Raugewitz, Tania: So do me a favor. Click on your key file.

744
01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:32.440
Anthony Taylor: Did you save it? No, save it real quick.

745
01:07:39.330 --> 01:07:41.309
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now go back and try that side.

746
01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:43.660
Anthony Taylor: True.

747
01:07:44.030 --> 01:07:46.449
Anthony Taylor: was that your problem, too, Tanya.

748
01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:48.090
Raugewitz, Tania: I'm getting there.

749
01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:49.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay, no worries.

750
01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:51.969
Raugewitz, Tania: No, it's still false.

751
01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:53.650
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Show me

752
01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:55.220
Raugewitz, Tania: sorry.

753
01:07:55.720 --> 01:08:01.360
Anthony Taylor: No, please don't be sorry. This everybody in this class has shared their screen once, I think.

754
01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:09.110
Anthony Taylor: Alright, let's find out why. So that's where. Oh, you can put the name of the file in so that line.

755
01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:16.470
Anthony Taylor: It doesn't matter what it's name. Honestly, Christine, it could be. We're using examples. But it could be keys.

756
01:08:17.729 --> 01:08:20.740
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, it whatever it is, just make sure it's consistent.

757
01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:21.960
Okay.

758
01:08:23.279 --> 01:08:24.849
I don't know what to put in there.

759
01:08:25.279 --> 01:08:30.380
Anthony Taylor: No, the name of the file. I'm sorry. II you know, when I was answering the question while you were doing

760
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:32.389
Anthony Taylor: so. Yeah, it's a

761
01:08:34.529 --> 01:08:36.510
Anthony Taylor: example.

762
01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:39.320
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, we're in quotes. Put it in quotes.

763
01:08:42.689 --> 01:08:44.950
Raugewitz, Tania: put dot EV at the end.

764
01:08:52.490 --> 01:08:53.340
Raugewitz, Tania: Thank you.

765
01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:00.740
Raugewitz, Tania: Are you there.

766
01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:11.449
Mason, Natalie: I think he froze. We lost him.

767
01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:20.629
Dipinto, Matt: That means we can party all early release. Let's go, everybody go get your Halloween masks.

768
01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:24.080
Raugewitz, Tania: I thought they were broken.

769
01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:46.689
Raugewitz, Tania: I was watching time you do it. And I'm like, up on your screen messed up like, Oh, wait!

770
01:09:47.130 --> 01:09:50.860
Anthony Taylor: Who's gonna go get it?

771
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.990
Anthony Taylor: Did that work, Tanya. Okay, good. Alright, let's continue

772
01:09:56.710 --> 01:10:02.189
michael mcpherson: mine, says Python. Dot embry could not parse statements starting at line 2.

773
01:10:02.710 --> 01:10:09.430
Anthony Taylor: Alright, shall we? Odds are good. You've got something wrong with your inv file. Just go ahead and show us real quick.

774
01:10:13.330 --> 01:10:15.500
Anthony Taylor: Well, okay, you didn't run.

775
01:10:16.530 --> 01:10:20.250
Anthony Taylor: So go to that one. Yeah. Run that that first one. No, don't do one off.

776
01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:23.219
Anthony Taylor: That's all right. It works well. No, it didn't.

777
01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.040
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Show me your emb file.

778
01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:32.139
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, see that quote that's missing. Actually, you got all kinds of weirdness.

779
01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:34.480
Go ahead and put a single quote there.

780
01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:37.960
Anthony Taylor: No, because one in front single. There you go.

781
01:10:38.970 --> 01:10:42.050
Anthony Taylor: Save that! Let's see if that solves your problem.

782
01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:46.940
michael mcpherson: When Michael Bolton did.

783
01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:50.929
Anthony Taylor: Okay, there you go.

784
01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:55.149
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Alright. Everybody's with me. No, no problem.

785
01:10:56.740 --> 01:11:06.109
Anthony Taylor: Okay, everybody's with me alright. So now we've loaded it. We're gonna run this every time. Now we're gonna move that file along with us and load it.

786
01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:17.020
Anthony Taylor: So to get it. we're going to do. OS, dot, get environment and ask for the value, the key for that thing. So

787
01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:22.790
Anthony Taylor: it's weird that they do type. They're just showing it. You got something, if you like. If you type this wrong

788
01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:24.099
Anthony Taylor: me, give you an example.

789
01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.960
Anthony Taylor: It doesn't error out.

790
01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:31.640
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So if you mess this up, probably no.

791
01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:35.779
Anthony Taylor: Well, I'm a typing untied

792
01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:40.800
Anthony Taylor: because I did a type. It gave me a none type. If you get it right.

793
01:11:41.190 --> 01:11:42.530
Anthony Taylor: it'll be a strength.

794
01:11:43.850 --> 01:11:51.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so that's just a way to check really quick. Alright. So now that we have our key. let's move on.

795
01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:56.689
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna do. We're gonna import requests. We're gonna go to the movie. dB,

796
01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:09.789
Anthony Taylor: we looked at the movie dB yesterday for a quick second. And all you do was basically put the name of the movie at the end. And then you could query the data about. so this one, there's the base. Yeah. URL,

797
01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:14.609
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna look at everything everywhere all at once, which was a pretty good movie.

798
01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:20.959
Anthony Taylor: And then we're gonna do our get and call it. And now notice this.

799
01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:31.140
Anthony Taylor: A. URL. Parameter called Ap. I key equals our Api key. Could you do this with the F screen? Yes, you could, by the way.

800
01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:34.270
Anthony Taylor: alright. But let's run this.

801
01:12:35.290 --> 01:12:37.620
Anthony Taylor: And now we can take a look at our data.

802
01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:42.979
Anthony Taylor: and we'll see, did we actually get something? And the answer is, yes, we did

803
01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:47.550
Anthony Taylor: so. Everybody should see exactly what I have on the screen. Right?

804
01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:55.170
Anthony Taylor: You scroll up a little bit. Sure I can.

805
01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:03.100
Anthony Taylor: What? What did you get?

806
01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:07.409
Mason, Natalie: Status? Codes? 7 invalid Api key?

807
01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:09.810
Anthony Taylor: So that means the

808
01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:17.890
Anthony Taylor: so if you're sure you got this right, go to your example.md. And make sure you put the key in right, or don't have any spaces.

809
01:13:19.290 --> 01:13:20.590
Anthony Taylor: anything like that?

810
01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:26.269
Anthony Taylor: Oh, I see. Yeah, I put a space in between the equals and the

811
01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:29.620
Mason, Natalie: okay.

812
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:34.370
Anthony Taylor: Now you should. Now you should get alright. Everybody else is good.

813
01:13:35.890 --> 01:13:37.030
Anthony Taylor: awesome.

814
01:13:37.410 --> 01:13:50.289
Anthony Taylor: So here, now, it's just Jason guys, you what we want the movie Id. Well, how do we get the movie? Id? Well, go to results inside of resources that an array. So we go 0. And we get the Id.

815
01:13:50.890 --> 01:13:52.930
Anthony Taylor: Okay, just like that.

816
01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:58.600
Anthony Taylor: And there's the Id here, we can do another one. Now here, we're doing it with the F string.

817
01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:04.780
Anthony Taylor: which I'm glad they showed you that. So the same exact URL, except gonna pass in the movie Id

818
01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:07.320
Anthony Taylor: and the Api key

819
01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:09.130
Anthony Taylor: and run this

820
01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:15.150
Anthony Taylor: and then output it. And we see we have a whole bunch more information.

821
01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:20.610
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this is like everything about the movie that the Imtp has

822
01:14:24.570 --> 01:14:29.480
Anthony Taylor: any questions about all that. That was a lot of work to do, like free commands. Yeah. Sign

823
01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:32.680
Anthony Taylor: unmute.

824
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:41.509
Anthony Taylor: Are you having trouble unmuting?

825
01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:45.569
Anthony Taylor: I want to keep pushing? Asked unmute.

826
01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:54.289
sonja baro: There she is. Did you see me? Did you read my lips? I'm saying, anyway, I gotta move this over to this side.

827
01:14:55.110 --> 01:15:00.899
sonja baro: My question was, what did we change in our request? That brought us more?

828
01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:05.639
Anthony Taylor: Let's look, because here all we did was to give us the title.

829
01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:08.180
Anthony Taylor: Yes, right

830
01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:13.100
Anthony Taylor: here we got the movie Id, and then in this next one, we said

831
01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:21.460
Anthony Taylor: Movie Id Api key. So we we basically, we made a different call.

832
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:31.340
Anthony Taylor: So the only way you would know this is to go and look at the documentation. Right? Okay, yeah, we made a different call. And and we're we're telling you. That's what that does.

833
01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:48.090
Anthony Taylor: And that's because the documentation says, if you want II we're not in a place right this moment where we can go through it all. But I mean, if you guys want to go and check it out, there's there's not too much documentation for T. And dB,

834
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:49.840
Anthony Taylor: it's fairly straightforward.

835
01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:58.830
sonja baro: No, I believe you. I just was like, okay, there had to been a change. And it was the value of movie Id that brought in all that other.

836
01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:02.199
sonja baro: Okay, I'm gonna move this.

837
01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:07.749
Anthony Taylor: Christine. What is your question? Can you just scroll up

838
01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:13.009
Kanouff, Christine: first couple of cells, cause I'm trying to figure out where I'm

839
01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:18.350
Anthony Taylor: well, did you get? Sdr. Right here, let's make sure you got that.

840
01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:23.989
Kanouff, Christine: No, that II got an error. But I I'm just looking to see why.

841
01:16:25.210 --> 01:16:31.329
Anthony Taylor: Well, how about? Let's watch you just share and let us all take a look.

842
01:16:32.010 --> 01:16:38.219
Kanouff, Christine: Oh, I'm sure it's gonna be amazing. Oh, yes, I'm about 5 steps behind you.

843
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:42.200
Anthony Taylor: You're doing fine. Alright. Let's see. So you got that in.

844
01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:47.280
Okay, you can get rid of this cell. Now the one that says Pippin, stop!

845
01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:49.010
Anthony Taylor: You don't need that anymore.

846
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:54.160
Anthony Taylor: You can trash that. Okay.

847
01:16:56.910 --> 01:17:06.470
Anthony Taylor: wait! That doesn't look great. Oh, the name of your file is example. Is this one? So right here, change not that. Not that. Go back up.

848
01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:10.070
Anthony Taylor: Sorry up. Wait.

849
01:17:10.890 --> 01:17:16.380
Anthony Taylor: It is. Tmdb, not. Mdb, okay, yeah, there you go.

850
01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:18.020
Anthony Taylor: You didn't load the file.

851
01:17:18.770 --> 01:17:21.490
Kanouff, Christine: I know.

852
01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:25.620
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's alright. Well, let's go get it. So

853
01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:29.979
Anthony Taylor: where can we get here, I'll just paste it into slack.

854
01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:40.400
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, because you're missing a whole cell. And actually, yours is named a little different than this. But that's okay.

855
01:17:44.050 --> 01:17:45.860
Anthony Taylor: Alright. I put it in the live.

856
01:17:51.630 --> 01:17:56.829
Anthony Taylor: So make a new cell, or put it like above that Api key thing. There

857
01:17:57.180 --> 01:18:02.690
Anthony Taylor: it goes under this one. But before this one. There you go.

858
01:18:03.330 --> 01:18:04.660
Anthony Taylor: Just paste that there

859
01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:11.200
Anthony Taylor: and then. Now you want to put the name of your file inside of this. So it

860
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:13.830
Anthony Taylor: example space keys. Dot.

861
01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:21.059
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now run that. and what you should see

862
01:18:21.310 --> 01:18:28.470
Anthony Taylor: is true. There you go. Now you can run this one awesome and hopefully you're good on that one

863
01:18:28.590 --> 01:18:29.869
Anthony Taylor: the next one

864
01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:33.269
Anthony Taylor: we'll know after you run the next one. We'll know if you're good.

865
01:18:35.230 --> 01:18:38.390
Anthony Taylor: Yep, awesome. Thank you. Awesome.

866
01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:45.040
Mason, Natalie: Mine just keeps telling me that I have an invalid key, but it is not invalid.

867
01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:48.629
Anthony Taylor: I tell you what. Here, take

868
01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:53.520
Anthony Taylor: my, take my file and just

869
01:18:53.710 --> 01:18:59.960
Anthony Taylor: try save it, and if that works, then you know that there's something wrong, like maybe copies your key wrong or so.

870
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:01.760
Anthony Taylor: So here's

871
01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:08.629
Anthony Taylor: there you go. So just copy it exactly like it is. Put it in your file and save it.

872
01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:10.730
Anthony Taylor: or make sure you save yours.

873
01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:12.970
Anthony Taylor: That's that a lot of people, miss that.

874
01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:15.239
Mason, Natalie: Did that happen?

875
01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:23.939
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So while Natalie's doing that is everyone kind of following what we've done. We've loaded a library

876
01:19:23.970 --> 01:19:25.240
Anthony Taylor: that takes

877
01:19:27.090 --> 01:19:29.170
Anthony Taylor: that that.

878
01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:39.000
Anthony Taylor: Oh, okay. We loaded a library that takes a variable that we've created puts it in a secure location.

879
01:19:39.450 --> 01:19:45.870
Anthony Taylor: all right, that we can then call later. Okay, the dot E and E file is the secure location.

880
01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:50.550
Anthony Taylor: and now we can call it, and then use it for the rest of our code.

881
01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:53.339
Anthony Taylor: Alright! How you doing that did that work!

882
01:19:55.230 --> 01:19:57.720
Anthony Taylor: Alright, I'll help you in just a sec. Let's keep going.

883
01:19:57.890 --> 01:20:00.680
Anthony Taylor:  alright. So

884
01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:02.510
Anthony Taylor: for the student activity.

885
01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:05.210
Anthony Taylor: First thing you need to do.

886
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:12.450
Anthony Taylor: copy the environment file you just made and used. So right, click it.

887
01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:13.900
Anthony Taylor: copy it.

888
01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:18.749
Anthony Taylor: Go to the unsolved. O, 4 folder, right? Click

889
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.990
Anthony Taylor: pace.

890
01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:32.850
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And that way when you go in here and you load your environment file. It'll be there. Okay, and you can copy it right out of the one we just did.

891
01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:34.620
Anthony Taylor: Hi.

892
01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:36.530
Masarirambi, Rodney: yeah.

893
01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:40.329
Anthony Taylor: I'm sorry. Did you mean to be sharing your screen while you were saying that

894
01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:50.409
Anthony Taylor: I did completely? Thank you. Let's do that again. So from Instructor One, you've made this file right? Click it.

895
01:20:50.820 --> 01:21:00.120
Anthony Taylor: copy it. go to the O 4 unsolved. Right? Click. paste it. Okay? So that you have the same file.

896
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:03.800
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna do that every time today

897
01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:10.359
Anthony Taylor: and that way, when you're in here and it says, Load it. You can just load it just like you did

898
01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:14.369
Anthony Taylor: in in the instructor in this just like this.

899
01:21:15.690 --> 01:21:19.360
Anthony Taylor: Okay. alright to do this.

900
01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:26.140
Oh, wow! You get 20 min for this, so we'll do this, and then we'll take break.

901
01:21:26.370 --> 01:21:27.450
Anthony Taylor: But

902
01:21:31.050 --> 01:21:33.429
Anthony Taylor: let me get you guys going.

903
01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:48.400
Anthony Taylor: So how did we do? Let me ask it this way. How many made it to the bonus?

904
01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:54.550
Anthony Taylor: That's most everybody but Matt. You're making the bonus.

905
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:58.870
Dipinto, Matt: We got very held up on trying to find how to find the credits.

906
01:21:59.910 --> 01:22:02.530
Anthony Taylor: It was literally in the read me.

907
01:22:05.210 --> 01:22:12.599
Anthony Taylor: yeah, we never actually opened the readmain. Well, look at that. Why isn't that the group that had like

908
01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:17.810
Anthony Taylor: 2 people that do what they were doing in it. Yeah, that explains a lot.

909
01:22:18.170 --> 01:22:20.699
michael mcpherson: But then those 2 had me. So

910
01:22:21.050 --> 01:22:24.279
sonja baro: you know. Bet you don't use instructions, Matt.

911
01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:26.409
sonja baro: Well, just throw those out.

912
01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:28.170
sonja baro: Yes.

913
01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:36.030
Anthony Taylor: that's all right. So the key to that one was. It was in the revy. And basically it was exactly

914
01:22:36.170 --> 01:22:41.410
Anthony Taylor: what we did in the demo except add credits to the Ed. But

915
01:22:41.570 --> 01:22:46.229
Anthony Taylor: so in our defense, we read the real documentation on Tmdb. To figure it out.

916
01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:52.839
Anthony Taylor: Well, I'm proud of you. thank you. That's what I wanted to hear. But you still didn't figure it out. No, did you? I didn't.

917
01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:59.300
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, we we got it right with, like, 2 min.

918
01:22:59.910 --> 01:23:04.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so outputs this one.

919
01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:13.359
Anthony Taylor: We're on this one. and we get our key here. Make sure it's a string. We don't have to do that, but it's nice.

920
01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:20.369
Anthony Taylor: So here. Same thing we did in the demo. We're just going to add a movie to the end of it and calculate it to the end of it.

921
01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:27.980
Anthony Taylor: so we can run that and take a look at our data. And it's gonna be beautiful. Well, actually, we're just doing the request now.

922
01:23:28.410 --> 01:23:31.029
Anthony Taylor: So it's running out there. Now

923
01:23:31.370 --> 01:23:36.040
Anthony Taylor: we can print it out. can see it. What we really need is that Id.

924
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:39.309
Anthony Taylor: right? So we're going to grab that Id.

925
01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:46.759
Anthony Taylor: Well, we can see it. So here's the bonus. So it said, get credits. We're gonna pass the movie id.

926
01:23:46.850 --> 01:23:48.340
Anthony Taylor: the yeah. URL,

927
01:23:48.450 --> 01:23:52.999
Anthony Taylor: with the same yeah, URL as the the instructor Demo, except

928
01:23:53.720 --> 01:24:08.020
Anthony Taylor: they added credits right here. Okay. and then we converted it to Json and then printed it out. So all we would have to do is grab the Id from the original results which will give us this value here.

929
01:24:09.690 --> 01:24:14.060
Anthony Taylor: And let me just remind you how we got there. Results

930
01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:25.190
Anthony Taylor: is an array is a list or an array. And so we have to do 0 because we want the first one. And then this is a dictionary. And so we need the key Id

931
01:24:26.170 --> 01:24:27.430
Anthony Taylor: results.

932
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:29.939
Anthony Taylor: 0, the key id.

933
01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:34.129
Anthony Taylor: that gives us the movie. Id, oh, I didn't actually execute the function.

934
01:24:34.150 --> 01:24:38.250
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So now we can call our cool function, and we get our results

935
01:24:40.150 --> 01:24:46.850
Anthony Taylor: pretty exciting. Here we're gonna do the same thing. But with a different movie house of flying daggers.

936
01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:54.840
Anthony Taylor: Oh, look! We're gonna go all the way through. So this is all in one command. Truthfully, you could do this in all one function. Be honest.

937
01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:57.559
Anthony Taylor: that would have been a nice bonus.

938
01:24:58.570 --> 01:25:02.609
Anthony Taylor: Powell's moving castle. What are these movies? I've never heard of.

939
01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:06.239
Anthony Taylor: The adventures of harvest

940
01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:07.500
Raugewitz, Tania: is awesome.

941
01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:13.359
Anthony Taylor: If Princess Bride isn't in here. There's really no reason to even do this.

942
01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:19.720
Anthony Taylor: It's inconceivable that Princess Pride's not in there.

943
01:25:21.970 --> 01:25:24.700
Anthony Taylor: but I'm more rhyming you should

944
01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:27.730
Anthony Taylor: we should move off, we should move on.

945
01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:33.219
sonja baro: State of that is as you wish. Alright! How about break time?

946
01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:38.279
Anthony Taylor: About that? Everybody come back 30 min after I'll see that.

947
01:25:38.490 --> 01:25:41.049
Anthony Taylor: And we'll get on New York Times.

948
01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:46.650
Anthony Taylor: Oh.

949
01:25:51.610 --> 01:25:52.930
Anthony Taylor: oh, that.

950
01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:04.509
Anthony Taylor: Okay. There's no slide for this

951
01:26:04.930 --> 01:26:06.610
Anthony Taylor: straight in

952
01:26:12.010 --> 01:26:13.930
Anthony Taylor: to the New York Times.

953
01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:19.289
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so first thing we wanna do copy your example, E and B file

954
01:26:21.010 --> 01:26:26.180
Anthony Taylor: and paste it into. In this case the O. 5 solve folder

955
01:26:26.770 --> 01:26:37.130
Anthony Taylor: so that you have it in there. I mean, really, all you have to have is the New York Times, Api key. But with, ya, okay. okay. So

956
01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:45.060
Anthony Taylor:  let's

957
01:26:45.390 --> 01:26:47.110
Anthony Taylor: very quickly

958
01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:53.780
Anthony Taylor: go back to the New York Times website, West haven't open. I sure wish I had it open.

959
01:26:54.030 --> 01:26:55.379
Anthony Taylor: I do not.

960
01:26:55.950 --> 01:26:59.619
Anthony Taylor: And I think, yeah.

961
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.690
Anthony Taylor: you guys don't all need to do this just kind of follow along. For now.

962
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:13.069
Anthony Taylor: okay. so we can go to the Apis page. And we can see all the different things we have to choose from.

963
01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:19.060
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we could do top stories. We could do article search, which is what we're going to do today.

964
01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:32.279
Anthony Taylor:  you'll you'll note that. So here's an example call. says Api. New York Times, Com. Svc. Search v. 2. Article search, dot Json.

965
01:27:33.210 --> 01:27:41.040
Anthony Taylor: Q. That's what we want to search for equals. Election, and then Ampersand. Api key, your key.

966
01:27:41.610 --> 01:27:43.849
Anthony Taylor: This is what you need to know

967
01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:46.950
Anthony Taylor: to call this Api. That's it.

968
01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:49.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now

969
01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:52.389
Anthony Taylor: note, there are a lot of features.

970
01:27:53.130 --> 01:27:56.880
Anthony Taylor: we could say certain field names. We can

971
01:27:57.050 --> 01:27:59.759
Anthony Taylor: say specific sources.

972
01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:04.890
Anthony Taylor: specific desks. we can. It's this one.

973
01:28:05.050 --> 01:28:10.889
Anthony Taylor: find articles with the word pokemon that were on the print paper's front page

974
01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:13.679
Anthony Taylor: so we could say, print section.

975
01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.549
Anthony Taylor: There's a lot

976
01:28:16.770 --> 01:28:22.770
Anthony Taylor: all Apis. Well, not all. Most Apis have a lot of options

977
01:28:23.610 --> 01:28:29.700
Anthony Taylor: like I told you. And I mean. this is the hardest part about Apis

978
01:28:30.790 --> 01:28:38.489
Anthony Taylor: is figuring out what you want, and then finding how to get it. Okay, once you figure it out, it's pretty easy.

979
01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:40.879
Anthony Taylor: It's gonna be just like I'm about to show you.

980
01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:42.320
Okay.

981
01:28:42.450 --> 01:28:44.700
Anthony Taylor: So let's get started.

982
01:28:47.010 --> 01:28:54.489
Anthony Taylor: So I've loaded all of my stuff. I'm going to load my file. Make sure it's string. Oh. if failed, something's wrong.

983
01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:58.279
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Well, what's wrong?

984
01:28:58.580 --> 01:28:59.659
Anthony Taylor: But I forget.

985
01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:03.300
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Inside the dot.

986
01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:07.989
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Do the dot environment parentheses. You have to put the name of your

987
01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:12.159
Anthony Taylor: thank you. And that worked a whole lot didn't.

988
01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:16.389
Anthony Taylor: So here you can see this is exactly what I just showed you

989
01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:23.109
Anthony Taylor: now, was it

990
01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:29.100
Anthony Taylor: just had it up on the screen? Yeah. So way at the top up here.

991
01:29:29.660 --> 01:29:34.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Api, New York Times Service search Article search, Json.

992
01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:39.160
Anthony Taylor: research or search Json.

993
01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:44.890
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so there's our link. We're gonna ask for granola.

994
01:29:46.250 --> 01:29:47.370
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

995
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:52.500
Anthony Taylor: So we'll click on that. Actually, no, we're not. Why would we ask for Granola?

996
01:29:52.720 --> 01:30:02.980
Anthony Taylor: Let's ask for open AI. Okay. alright. So here's our new yeah. URL, so it's the base. Yeah. URL, plus Api key

997
01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:12.310
Anthony Taylor: equals our actual Api key plus the Ampersand Q equals. And then the actual thing we want to query for.

998
01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:16.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this can be done with F strings with. However, you want to do it

999
01:30:17.370 --> 01:30:20.460
Anthony Taylor: alright, now that we have that, we can do our get

1000
01:30:20.660 --> 01:30:22.350
Anthony Taylor: and make the call.

1001
01:30:22.670 --> 01:30:30.359
Anthony Taylor: and this is going to give us these articles. Note. We're putting it straight into Json. So we're going to have this Json object

1002
01:30:30.860 --> 01:30:41.490
Anthony Taylor: with all of the articles listed. Then we're going to. And and you know what I don't like. They do it this way. So let's let's just

1003
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:51.529
Anthony Taylor: let's print out articles. So let's look at what this looks like. okay, so it's kind of crazy right now, that's alright. So you can see there's a web. Yeah. URL, there's a snippet.

1004
01:30:52.720 --> 01:31:02.680
Anthony Taylor: Okay, there's a lead paragraph. What page did it print on? What section? There's multimedia items.

1005
01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:06.360
Anthony Taylor: all of this good stuff, right?

1006
01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:08.299
Anthony Taylor: So that's cool.

1007
01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:13.530
Anthony Taylor: So this is gonna so we can see right away that this is

1008
01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:18.620
Anthony Taylor: the docks is a list. Okay?

1009
01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:25.020
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to. So we're going to pull in that list and then take a look at it. So let's do that.

1010
01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:34.110
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so let's take a look. So now, it's little easier to see. Okay.

1011
01:31:34.150 --> 01:31:48.040
Anthony Taylor: that what that we have. So within this list is a number of documents. So how can we see them all? Well at the list? We're just going to loop through them. So we're going to say for article and articles. List. Print the URL,

1012
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:53.850
Anthony Taylor: okay, we're just going to print that one item.

1013
01:31:54.590 --> 01:32:00.090
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So let's just run that and look at that. Now we have a reading list

1014
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:03.720
Anthony Taylor: of New York Times articles about app

1015
01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:07.980
Anthony Taylor: pretty cool, huh? Let's see, that's pretty cool.

1016
01:32:11.050 --> 01:32:13.979
Anthony Taylor: Course we can't read them unless you have a subscription. But whatever?

1017
01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:19.000
Anthony Taylor: Okay. which isn't entirely true, because

1018
01:32:19.290 --> 01:32:24.570
Anthony Taylor: you can read some of them right here, you can actually get quite a bit of the content using the Api.

1019
01:32:25.590 --> 01:32:28.609
Anthony Taylor: So that's pretty cool, pretty simple.

1020
01:32:29.300 --> 01:32:38.719
Anthony Taylor: right? You're like, well, what was hard about that? Nothing. Because we told you how to do this once. You know this. not that complicated

1021
01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:46.899
sonja baro: alright. We can use. You changed what you were doing to

1022
01:32:47.530 --> 01:32:54.109
sonja baro: no. And then down below you said, oh, I commented this out just so you guys could see

1023
01:32:54.350 --> 01:33:00.169
Anthony Taylor: the before we did this parsing. That's all.

1024
01:33:00.410 --> 01:33:04.579
sonja baro: Okay. Yeah, alright, thank you. I just wanted you to see it before we did that.

1025
01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:06.039
sonja baro: But yeah.

1026
01:33:07.110 --> 01:33:13.640
Anthony Taylor: okay. And I mean, and guys from a development standpoint. if and and

1027
01:33:14.490 --> 01:33:23.250
Anthony Taylor: what happens? Let me again all the time. I'm doing this right now ticket. Basically, I'll give you guys some political stuff. Okay, we had this group

1028
01:33:23.370 --> 01:33:27.999
Anthony Taylor: that was supposed to be doing all of our Api stuff, and they were

1029
01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:30.469
Anthony Taylor: ridiculously slow.

1030
01:33:30.630 --> 01:33:37.720
Anthony Taylor: horrible bureaucrats, and just overall terrible. Okay, so

1031
01:33:45.380 --> 01:33:56.040
Masarirambi, Rodney: did we lose them again.

1032
01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:58.960
sonja baro: But good job mask

1033
01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:03.040
Mason, Natalie: we give freeze when he comes back in.

1034
01:34:03.870 --> 01:34:05.690
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Did anybody

1035
01:34:05.790 --> 01:34:12.350
sonja baro: did everybody's New York Times Api work. Did anyone get an error? Meredith?

1036
01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:16.459
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I got an invalid Api key, even though, like

1037
01:34:17.060 --> 01:34:22.530
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I know, it's like, I'm looking at it right now on the New York Times page, and it's fine. So

1038
01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:31.370
sonja baro: well, I got that. But did you copy your environment folder or file into this activity

1039
01:34:31.470 --> 01:34:33.940
Meredith McCanse (she/her): it did

1040
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:43.180
sonja baro: what were you guys talking about without me, here.

1041
01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:45.500
Dipinto, Matt: that we're waiting to hear your story

1042
01:34:45.950 --> 01:34:48.160
Mason, Natalie: started talking bad about.

1043
01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:53.269
Anthony Taylor: I did this group. They're horrible. They're horrible, horrible, right?

1044
01:34:53.330 --> 01:34:57.889
Anthony Taylor:  Oh, no! Can I lose you again? Yep. Still here.

1045
01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:01.909
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Good. No. It gave me another warning. I don't know what's going on today.

1046
01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:08.450
Anthony Taylor: It's it's really weird. Because my. II would normally just I have multiple networks in the house.

1047
01:35:08.580 --> 01:35:14.620
Anthony Taylor: I would normally just switch to another network. But it's not even giving me the option to do that. It's really strange, anyway.

1048
01:35:14.730 --> 01:35:20.499
Anthony Taylor:  they're horrible. So when they hired me, I came in.

1049
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:27.589
Gardner, Curry: Okay, this time we're just gonna stay still.

1050
01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:30.040
Dipinto, Matt: Everyone frees sandwich.

1051
01:35:30.430 --> 01:35:35.389
sonja baro: I love Clayton's mask man. He hasn't noticed it.

1052
01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:39.479
sonja baro: That's a good one.

1053
01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:43.849
Mason, Natalie: They're like solar flares happening in Texas, or something.

1054
01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:55.840
sonja baro: Be back on soon, so it'll be good ready to freeze.

1055
01:35:57.810 --> 01:36:00.739
Masarirambi, Rodney: Oh, wait, no, he's not getting kicked yet, so it's fine.

1056
01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:09.740
Masarirambi, Rodney: or maybe he's actually messing with us, and he's just freezing there and holding us. I don't think so.

1057
01:36:10.420 --> 01:36:12.790
Masarirambi, Rodney: Okay, there we go. Are you ready?

1058
01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:16.229
sonja baro: Oh, Kevin's Kevin's taken over.

1059
01:36:16.780 --> 01:36:21.409
sonja baro: Where is he? Where is there he is? I see that head.

1060
01:36:21.970 --> 01:36:24.489
Kevin Nguyen: We'll be back, Anthony, we'll be back.

1061
01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:32.010
sonja baro: I won't need to take over. Don't worry

1062
01:36:33.850 --> 01:36:37.900
michael mcpherson: for the Api key. What you guys can do is

1063
01:36:38.180 --> 01:36:40.369
Kevin Nguyen: Print out the key in the notebook

1064
01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:44.360
Kevin Nguyen: and make sure it matches what you're seeing when you register.

1065
01:36:44.540 --> 01:36:54.620
sonja baro: and if you can't print it out, that means that your key is not working your environment where it was not working. Okay? Oh, so just print. Just do print.

1066
01:36:54.900 --> 01:36:56.250
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Api key.

1067
01:36:57.060 --> 01:37:00.060
Kevin Nguyen: Yeah. Print whatever variable you defined it to.

1068
01:37:00.730 --> 01:37:01.740
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay.

1069
01:37:03.010 --> 01:37:11.350
sonja baro: And Meredith, now, mine's working. Oh, okay, yeah, it's doing weird. That's weird. Cause I do. I, delete. I wonder if it's pulling from a different.

1070
01:37:15.250 --> 01:37:18.309
Meredith McCanse (she/her): It's it's pulling an older version of it.

1071
01:37:19.530 --> 01:37:26.269
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Even though I updated it. It had a typo in it originally, but I updated it since then and have saved the file.

1072
01:37:26.860 --> 01:37:28.589
Meredith McCanse (she/her): but it's still

1073
01:37:32.130 --> 01:37:35.300
Meredith McCanse (she/her): It's still pulling the older version with the typo in it.

1074
01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:38.500
Meredith McCanse (she/her): How to fix that?

1075
01:37:40.130 --> 01:37:43.489
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I guess I could just lead again.

1076
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:47.110
sonja baro: They must be Gremlin Day, right? Cause like

1077
01:37:47.650 --> 01:37:50.160
sonja baro: little stuff here and there for everybody.

1078
01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:57.479
sonja baro: That's what happens when you start complaining about the man like, you know, it's like,

1079
01:37:59.790 --> 01:38:06.420
Masarirambi, Rodney: I'm still hitting that error. I'm trying. I think we might just go back to derivative newer times and see if that's

1080
01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:18.949
sonja baro: you're a fan, Clayton, with that mask man that's that's pretty legit.

1081
01:38:21.310 --> 01:38:24.399
sonja baro: Mr. Myers, with the hair and everything.

1082
01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:47.780
Clayton Graves: Yeah, but I can't breathe or talk on the thing. It's so it constricts your face. You can't.

1083
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:56.360
sonja baro: Maybe that's what put him over the edge. That's probably why he was so quiet because he couldn't talk in that dang thing?

1084
01:38:57.080 --> 01:39:00.920
Mason, Natalie: Is it one of those like rubber masks that have that weird smell?

1085
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:04.459
Mason, Natalie: Or is it just plastic nostrils? Yeah.

1086
01:39:04.780 --> 01:39:06.970
sonja baro: OP.

1087
01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:10.210
Mason, Natalie: Supposed to have a weird smell. Same? Yeah.

1088
01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:15.659
Clayton Graves: I'm 6, 4. You put me in a jumpsuit and that mask, and and I can scare some little kids.

1089
01:39:16.770 --> 01:39:27.789
sonja baro: Just walk down the street one evening. I stay home at night.

1090
01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:31.420
Mason, Natalie: You guys should go look up Michael Myers in Decatur.

1091
01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:40.539
michael mcpherson: Yeah, I was. Gonna talk about him. It's him and his son. He's just always walking around like Michael Myers really. Is there some idea in Decatur, Illinois?

1092
01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:41.670
Clayton Graves: Yeah, he's

1093
01:39:41.810 --> 01:39:53.299
sonja baro: grocery shopping or hanging out with his son. His son dresses up like it, too, and Michael Myers, indicator, to look it up on Facebook. I like when they go bicycle riding

1094
01:39:53.350 --> 01:39:55.080
michael mcpherson: right

1095
01:40:06.170 --> 01:40:10.070
sonja baro: like Matt's closing deals. He's he's taking care of business.

1096
01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:19.120
sonja baro: I see him with his other year. But I see you closing deals. I'm I'm actively shopping over here.

1097
01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:21.369
michael mcpherson: That's so sweet. What are you getting us?

1098
01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:23.870
Masarirambi, Rodney: What are you getting us?

1099
01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:29.270
Masarirambi, Rodney: What are you getting us? What are you getting? First, man? Oh, Chris, hey, Tony's man.

1100
01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:31.410
Anthony Taylor: So where you guys

1101
01:40:32.620 --> 01:40:34.560
Mason, Natalie: no

1102
01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:43.999
michael mcpherson: been, we've been sitting here talking crap about you. You're you were choppy to start. You're kind of clear now. Oh, I'm going to be choppy. I'm on my

1103
01:40:44.850 --> 01:40:48.110
while I wait for my Internet to come back up. But

1104
01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:52.309
Anthony Taylor: okay, so I'm not gonna tell that damn story cause it keeps disconnecting

1105
01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:58.060
Anthony Taylor: while while I'm on my phone. So I don't use you guys.

1106
01:40:58.340 --> 01:41:00.200
Mason, Natalie: Okay, so anyway.

1107
01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:04.219
Anthony Taylor: let's get back to work. We were almost done in

1108
01:41:06.270 --> 01:41:06.930
Dipinto, Matt: fuck.

1109
01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:17.110
Anthony Taylor: okay, can you guys see everything?  yeah.

1110
01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:19.899
Clayton Graves: yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

1111
01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:22.030
Anthony Taylor: Okay, thank you.

1112
01:41:22.150 --> 01:41:23.620
alright,

1113
01:41:25.610 --> 01:41:29.310
Anthony Taylor:  so, yeah, we should finish this so

1114
01:41:30.090 --> 01:41:34.739
Anthony Taylor: the in the next. So so everyone got that. So in the next one

1115
01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:36.360
in 6,

1116
01:41:36.660 --> 01:41:42.340
Anthony Taylor: I want you to go in there. Make sure you copy your examples that emb into that section

1117
01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:43.660
Anthony Taylor: top

1118
01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:46.730
Anthony Taylor: taste.

1119
01:41:47.130 --> 01:41:51.199
Anthony Taylor: And in this one they're gonna have you do basically what we just did.

1120
01:41:51.470 --> 01:41:57.610
Anthony Taylor:  But you're going to print it out a little differently. You're going to print out the snippets.

1121
01:41:58.590 --> 01:42:08.570
Anthony Taylor: And now this one's pretty interesting. Here you're gonna I'm not gonna tell you the answer to this, but I will tell you this. If you go to the documentation it'll you'll note you only get 10

1122
01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:23.440
Anthony Taylor: per call. It's possible to get more. but you have to go to the documentation and figure out how to get it. I want you to get 30 of them. Okay. so everybody acknowledged you heard me because I can't tell.

1123
01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:24.970
Anthony Taylor: Yes, okay. Good.

1124
01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.590
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So for this one

1125
01:42:28.740 --> 01:42:32.449
Anthony Taylor: 20 min I thought, Wait, what time is? Yeah, 20 min.

1126
01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:35.220
Anthony Taylor: Okay. hiking.

1127
01:42:36.810 --> 01:42:38.280
Anthony Taylor: And I will get my

1128
01:42:51.460 --> 01:42:54.079
welcome back. Everybody.

1129
01:42:54.130 --> 01:42:58.160
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So we do believe my Internet is back working fine again.

1130
01:42:58.950 --> 01:43:02.790
Anthony Taylor: Watch, as I say that it would be. Whatever

1131
01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:05.439
Anthony Taylor: okay. Can you tell us story now?

1132
01:43:05.940 --> 01:43:07.960
Anthony Taylor: No, I forgot it. Oh, wait!

1133
01:43:08.030 --> 01:43:20.630
Anthony Taylor: It basically was just that we had this whole department that was doing the Api stuff for us, and I came in, I said, to take it too long, too much red tape, blah, blah blah. And we basically, that department now no longer works there.

1134
01:43:20.730 --> 01:43:33.590
Anthony Taylor: that was basically the root of it. But the main. The main point of the story is that Apis aren't hard. Once you learn how to read the documentation once you get good at the documentation writing Api apps is

1135
01:43:36.250 --> 01:43:40.840
Anthony Taylor: simple. Okay? Almost always.

1136
01:43:41.260 --> 01:43:44.999
Anthony Taylor: Why, Curry? Why, that face you run Api apps Curry.

1137
01:43:46.020 --> 01:43:50.989
Anthony Taylor: No, no. Okay. Well, trust me, just believe me.

1138
01:43:51.870 --> 01:43:58.089
Anthony Taylor: take my word. all right, let's quickly go through that. How'd you guys do with that?

1139
01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:03.350
Anthony Taylor: Did we get through it all. Did. Who got the 30?

1140
01:44:03.390 --> 01:44:04.999
Anthony Taylor: Want to know who got the 30?

1141
01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:09.880
Anthony Taylor: All right, Brando. Anybody else?

1142
01:44:12.250 --> 01:44:15.049
Mckimmy, Brandon: Did you mean complete it, or just get to it.

1143
01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:17.960
Anthony Taylor: Well, I'd love to know if you completed it.

1144
01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:21.649
Mckimmy, Brandon: I made progress, but not fully completed it.

1145
01:44:23.670 --> 01:44:28.349
michael mcpherson: I think Matt and Curry get could could have if they hadn't had me tagging along.

1146
01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:31.840
Anthony Taylor: Were you just like an anchor, Mike?

1147
01:44:32.060 --> 01:44:34.880
Dipinto, Matt: No, friend, that we were working with?

1148
01:44:36.230 --> 01:44:48.669
Anthony Taylor: Alright, alright! Let's let's just go through this real quick. We're not going to get through everything today. So we're gonna do some stuff next class. But we'll make it work. So first

1149
01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:51.529
Anthony Taylor: Api key. Blah, blah, blah blah.

1150
01:44:51.610 --> 01:44:56.999
Anthony Taylor: and we're gonna call begin date, end date. I don't know how much of this they gave you, but

1151
01:44:57.280 --> 01:45:02.510
Anthony Taylor:  we just want articles published in this time. Range on blockbuster.

1152
01:45:02.670 --> 01:45:05.159
Anthony Taylor: Most of you probably never heard of that.

1153
01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:10.429
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to list them out. I mean, that's it a little snippet from each one.

1154
01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:12.580
Anthony Taylor: There you go.

1155
01:45:17.910 --> 01:45:19.979
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, that's exciting.

1156
01:45:21.770 --> 01:45:24.739
Anthony Taylor: I don't know what these have to do with blockbuster. But whatever.

1157
01:45:25.370 --> 01:45:28.790
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so everybody got this? Yeah.

1158
01:45:30.340 --> 01:45:33.219
Anthony Taylor: no, no. Where'd you guys get stuck on this?

1159
01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:52.709
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I couldn't. I took a long time trying to get the query to work. I thought it. If you looked at the New York Times website like we were able to find an example of what it would look like to ask for been again an end date, but it was a totally different like the the different parts of it were in a different order.

1160
01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:55.259
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Well, the order doesn't matter

1161
01:45:56.010 --> 01:45:59.980
Anthony Taylor: as long as you put the variables like this it doesn't matter.

1162
01:46:01.140 --> 01:46:03.080
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay, trying to find it again.

1163
01:46:03.230 --> 01:46:06.940
Anthony Taylor: Let's go here. So yeah, if we do.

1164
01:46:10.250 --> 01:46:12.730
Anthony Taylor: here you go. So

1165
01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:20.899
Anthony Taylor: you can do something like this. You have the query, you don't necessarily have to do facet fields, but you would want begin date equals and end date

1166
01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:31.370
Anthony Taylor: just like it doesn't matter where you put it. You just have to have it somewhere. Nope, it just has to be in the same somewhere in there because these are named variables. They're not position

1167
01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:37.119
Anthony Taylor: by member, like in functions. You can have like a name one, and

1168
01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:48.010
Anthony Taylor: whichever okay. alright. But yeah. So yeah, once you put these in here, that's that's all. You. And then that'll give you that date range. And away you go.

1169
01:46:49.130 --> 01:46:53.010
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Anybody else get stuck on that

1170
01:46:54.050 --> 01:46:55.620
Anthony Taylor: or something similar.

1171
01:46:55.960 --> 01:47:00.370
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Can you scroll up and show the code you did for the to show the snippets again?

1172
01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:02.110
Anthony Taylor: Oh, right here.

1173
01:47:02.290 --> 01:47:10.970
Anthony Taylor: So we went to Docs, and then there was an article named. or a key called Snippet.

1174
01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:16.130
Anthony Taylor: and so we just went for each article. Give me the snippet. print it out.

1175
01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:23.870
Anthony Taylor: Is that mildly clear we can look at.

1176
01:47:24.110 --> 01:47:33.989
sonja baro: So let's see if it's in the documentation. So Anthony is, that's just like a loop. Right? We're just doing a loop? Oh, no, it was just yeah. Cause remember when when you pull them in, you get 10 of it.

1177
01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:40.600
Anthony Taylor: Remember from the example you get 10 of them. right? So that 10 makes a list.

1178
01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:48.010
Anthony Taylor: and you can. Just so you just loop through the list and go give me this this key for each item in the list.

1179
01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:50.380
sonja baro: Yep, okay.

1180
01:47:51.020 --> 01:47:52.110
Anthony Taylor: make sense.

1181
01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:53.130
sonja baro: Yeah.

1182
01:47:53.570 --> 01:48:01.860
Anthony Taylor: I'm looking around the room. I see, mostly not entirely blank stairs. So we're kind of getting this.

1183
01:48:03.430 --> 01:48:08.090
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Alright, that's alright. You have practice no big.

1184
01:48:09.910 --> 01:48:12.110
sonja baro: Oh, I gotta put myself on mute.

1185
01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:14.879
Anthony Taylor: Why we were so enjoying them.

1186
01:48:15.100 --> 01:48:22.040
sonja baro: Well, cause I'm gonna slip up one moment, and that's what Matt's waiting for. I know for me to like. Lose it

1187
01:48:22.110 --> 01:48:31.100
sonja baro: with my my mute off. I'm just waiting to see who you cure curse when you're accidentally unmuted, I know, and I'm not gonna do it

1188
01:48:31.170 --> 01:48:44.120
Anthony Taylor: alright. Well, let's continue on. So how would we get 30 if it gives us 10 at a time. Well, it's pretty obvious we would need to do something to tell it. Give me another tent.

1189
01:48:44.190 --> 01:48:47.169
Anthony Taylor: so what we could do is go back to documentation.

1190
01:48:47.670 --> 01:48:55.999
Anthony Taylor:  there's a lot of ways you could do this now. My experience would tell me if I just do fine.

1191
01:48:56.090 --> 01:49:02.740
Anthony Taylor: that I'm going to look for either next. which came up with nothing or Page

1192
01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:15.409
Anthony Taylor: Page came up with something. Okay. So now I'm going to look at what page is coming up to. And this says, page to nation. Max, 10. Results.

1193
01:49:15.750 --> 01:49:21.509
Anthony Taylor: Use the page. Query, parameters. So that's question. Mark page equals

1194
01:49:21.910 --> 01:49:28.210
Anthony Taylor: page 0 for results, one to 11 for 11 to 20, etc., all the way up to a hundred.

1195
01:49:29.410 --> 01:49:33.609
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so with that information now in my hands.

1196
01:49:33.660 --> 01:49:39.010
Anthony Taylor: I know I could come in here. grab the first 10. No problem.

1197
01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:45.699
Anthony Taylor: tell it to take a break, and then go back and grab the second 10. Where's the page? Item?

1198
01:49:47.460 --> 01:49:58.829
Anthony Taylor: Oh, they're adding it right here. So they took. Here's the original URL for the beginning and end date. And then they've added on to it. Why, they would do it here the page equals.

1199
01:49:58.990 --> 01:50:02.189
Anthony Taylor: and they're passing in 0 1, 2,

1200
01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:04.010
Anthony Taylor: right?

1201
01:50:04.180 --> 01:50:10.960
Anthony Taylor: And so this will give us first, page, second page, third page, which would be a total of 30. We're gonna put those

1202
01:50:11.330 --> 01:50:21.260
Anthony Taylor: into this list. Then we can go through that list like we did up above and instead of 10. So it's going to take a little longer because it's got to go 3 times

1203
01:50:23.070 --> 01:50:25.430
Anthony Taylor: will have 30

1204
01:50:28.220 --> 01:50:29.950
Anthony Taylor: pretty exciting. Huh?

1205
01:50:34.710 --> 01:50:35.920
Anthony Taylor: Everybody follow.

1206
01:50:37.650 --> 01:50:40.440
Anthony Taylor: Okay, how are we doing on time?

1207
01:50:45.260 --> 01:50:47.640
Anthony Taylor: we have quite a bit to do.

1208
01:50:49.230 --> 01:50:55.409
Anthony Taylor:  So we'll just I'm gonna I think what I'm gonna do.

1209
01:50:55.660 --> 01:51:09.220
Anthony Taylor: I'll show you the next one. Maybe we'll do it as and everyone do, and then we'll stop and we'll do exception. Handling start of Monday. Okay. alright. So here, same thing as before.

1210
01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:14.810
Anthony Taylor: Make sure I have it in here. I do run it.

1211
01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:22.790
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So this is now the open Api weather map. So in this one. If we go in here.

1212
01:51:22.890 --> 01:51:26.270
Anthony Taylor: we go to open weather map

1213
01:51:29.270 --> 01:51:38.020
Anthony Taylor: back to the same thing. Here's our Api key. R, okay. you to get

1214
01:51:40.090 --> 01:51:49.339
Anthony Taylor: the documentation you have to click on Api up your top. and then you can come in here and start looking at the Api dots

1215
01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:53.340
Anthony Taylor: current weather. and then it looks like this.

1216
01:51:53.710 --> 01:52:01.949
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so Api, data 3.0 one call Lac law. We don't want to go get that law. Let's see what other options we have

1217
01:52:02.140 --> 01:52:04.030
Anthony Taylor: right? There's that long

1218
01:52:04.270 --> 01:52:06.829
Anthony Taylor: or that long.

1219
01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:19.420
Anthony Taylor: So I will tell you. And when you dig into this a little bit you're gonna find out that you can do it by city.

1220
01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:31.689
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So that you don't have to get the lat long and better yet, who give you the lat. So if we do this, we say whether we're going to say we want it in metrics.

1221
01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:35.810
Anthony Taylor: which is, I don't know that weird European thing.

1222
01:52:36.250 --> 01:52:38.130
Anthony Taylor: Okay, right, Rodney.

1223
01:52:38.290 --> 01:52:39.760
Anthony Taylor: and then

1224
01:52:39.820 --> 01:52:43.979
Anthony Taylor: the Q equals. We're just going to pass in a city name.

1225
01:52:44.700 --> 01:52:52.960
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we're going to run this. Then here we're gonna pass in London. and we're going to get a response. And this is what it's going to look like.

1226
01:52:53.460 --> 01:52:56.839
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now notice, it gave me latitude and longitude.

1227
01:52:57.720 --> 01:53:11.630
Anthony Taylor: and it has the weather. It's clear, clear sky. even as the icon it would use. Okay. goes through all this cool stuff. and that's that's pretty much all thing.

1228
01:53:11.930 --> 01:53:15.900
Anthony Taylor: Alright. You're going to call it this. Yeah. URL,

1229
01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:23.289
Anthony Taylor: we're going to pass in the App id, which is our key and the units which are metric, and then a city.

1230
01:53:23.660 --> 01:53:35.819
Anthony Taylor: and it gives us this weather information. So here we're going to go through all 4 of these. We're gonna get the latitude. We're gonna get the temperature. So we're going to call it

1231
01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:40.690
Anthony Taylor: passing in the city. Get coordinates, Lat, and then main temp.

1232
01:53:41.230 --> 01:53:45.870
Anthony Taylor: Write it down, put it in the list at the end. We're going to look at the list.

1233
01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:49.189
Anthony Taylor: There it is.

1234
01:53:50.070 --> 01:53:56.829
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now, just so you guys know or can see it. Let's look at an actual response here.

1235
01:54:00.210 --> 01:54:07.000
Anthony Taylor: So this is what is actually coming back. So you can see coordinate lap. See how it got that

1236
01:54:07.930 --> 01:54:08.940
Anthony Taylor: coordinate

1237
01:54:09.110 --> 01:54:11.170
Anthony Taylor: black. That's this one here

1238
01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:14.430
Anthony Taylor: and then main temp.

1239
01:54:14.510 --> 01:54:21.750
Anthony Taylor: So you come in here up there's Maine. But that's not right. Right? That's whether Maine. So here's main. And here's 10,

1240
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:23.050
Anthony Taylor: 1.9, 4

1241
01:54:25.110 --> 01:54:26.290
Anthony Taylor: guys follow.

1242
01:54:26.820 --> 01:54:28.929
Anthony Taylor: See how we got those those

1243
01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:34.780
Anthony Taylor: paths you pretty much will always want to output like one call.

1244
01:54:36.180 --> 01:54:43.900
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So that you can see what you got to go get, or what you have available to you. They do tell you into the documentation. But sometimes it's hard to find.

1245
01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:46.360
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1246
01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:48.160
Anthony Taylor: Hi.

1247
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:55.849
Anthony Taylor: so now that we have a list of latitudes and a list of temperatures and a list of cities.

1248
01:54:56.060 --> 01:55:03.180
Anthony Taylor: we can do a dictionary of lists and create the data frame. and there you go.

1249
01:55:03.780 --> 01:55:09.859
Anthony Taylor: So now, what have we done? We went out to an Api. We got data from a live source.

1250
01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:15.200
Anthony Taylor: brought it back and created a data frame that we can now use any way we like.

1251
01:55:17.380 --> 01:55:18.619
Anthony Taylor: We can use it

1252
01:55:18.810 --> 01:55:25.409
Anthony Taylor: just like that. We could put it into a data warehouse. We could put it into a machine learning algorithm

1253
01:55:26.430 --> 01:55:33.940
Anthony Taylor: all kinds of stuff. I mean. I wouldn't put this in the machine learning algorithm. However, if you had, you know, years of tempt data.

1254
01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:36.739
Anthony Taylor: you could definitely come up with some predictive models.

1255
01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:40.580
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

1256
01:55:41.810 --> 01:55:43.189
Anthony Taylor: Questions on this one.

1257
01:55:44.090 --> 01:55:49.039
Anthony Taylor: Does everybody continue to see what the hardest thing about Apis is, what is it? One more time?

1258
01:55:49.150 --> 01:55:50.520
Anthony Taylor: What's the hardest thing?

1259
01:55:52.010 --> 01:55:53.450
sonja baro: Documentation.

1260
01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:55.780
Anthony Taylor: reading the documentation?

1261
01:55:56.290 --> 01:56:04.680
Anthony Taylor: You gotta do it. You cannot do doing this stuff, as you can see. I mean, really, the second hardest thing is probably parsing the Json

1262
01:56:04.990 --> 01:56:08.779
Anthony Taylor: right? Which I gave you guys kind of a thing to do that for you.

1263
01:56:09.570 --> 01:56:13.049
Anthony Taylor: You know that little extension we put into our Vs code.

1264
01:56:13.170 --> 01:56:16.090
Anthony Taylor: So the hardest part is just figuring out how to make the call.

1265
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:25.290
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So practice that if nothing else.  alright, let's do this last one.

1266
01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:27.500
Anthony Taylor: Doesn't everyone do.

1267
01:56:29.150 --> 01:56:32.640
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna copy. I file in here.

1268
01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:39.900
Anthony Taylor: Okay and

1269
01:56:42.300 --> 01:56:44.020
Anthony Taylor: let me get to read me up.

1270
01:56:45.790 --> 01:56:48.390
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, that one. I was only supposed to be 5 min short.

1271
01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:59.739
Anthony Taylor:  So let's go through this guy real quick. And then that way we'll all we'll have left is

1272
01:57:01.290 --> 01:57:09.479
Anthony Taylor: exception handling when we come back, which is good, because exception handling is awesome. and it's kind of a fun lesson. Hi, so I've

1273
01:57:09.530 --> 01:57:12.260
Anthony Taylor: got my dot, E and V set up.

1274
01:57:15.050 --> 01:57:25.139
Anthony Taylor: And here's my URL. We're gonna do exactly the same. Yeah. URL, we did in the demo. So we don't need to do my outfits. We don't need to do anything special there.

1275
01:57:25.310 --> 01:57:33.580
Anthony Taylor: Okay, here's our list of cities. So we're gonna set up lists to hold response for latitude. Longitude. Oh, my God, that's a lot!

1276
01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:37.810
Anthony Taylor: Oh, my God. alright! So here's what I'm gonna do.

1277
01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:41.130
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna do

1278
01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:46.909
Anthony Taylor: one of these with you. And then I'm going to give you the whole block because that'll take forever to type it.

1279
01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:50.469
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we're gonna I'm gonna go ahead and type these out latitude

1280
01:57:50.570 --> 01:57:51.830
Anthony Taylor: facts. Well.

1281
01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:54.570
Anthony Taylor: lunge to.

1282
01:57:55.330 --> 01:58:09.240
Anthony Taylor: And all we're doing is make an empty list that we're going to put data into, because in the end we're going to create a data frame right with these lists.  so we're just going to create the list first.

1283
01:58:09.650 --> 01:58:10.680
Anthony Taylor: You don't

1284
01:58:10.830 --> 01:58:15.829
Anthony Taylor: to be truthful. You don't actually have to create these empty lists. But it's a good idea to do.

1285
01:58:16.010 --> 01:58:20.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. So now we're gonna say for city and cities.

1286
01:58:23.260 --> 01:58:25.619
Anthony Taylor: So that means we're going to loop through these cities

1287
01:58:25.890 --> 01:58:29.869
Anthony Taylor: alright. And we're going to start with our

1288
01:58:29.890 --> 01:58:33.159
Anthony Taylor: well, actually, well, I won't go pull it from there. I'll just type it.

1289
01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:45.840
Anthony Taylor: Response equals requests. Dot get. we're gonna pass in our query, yeah, URL plus our city value Paris, for instance.

1290
01:58:45.950 --> 01:58:50.330
Anthony Taylor: And then we're gonna say. Dot Json.

1291
01:58:50.510 --> 01:58:51.539
Anthony Taylor: that's it.

1292
01:58:52.200 --> 01:59:02.889
Anthony Taylor: We now have our data for Paris. Okay, the long part is filling in all of these thing. So we're gonna do left out of pen.

1293
01:59:03.110 --> 01:59:07.769
Anthony Taylor: And and again, you'd have to know where all of these things are. So it's gonna be response.

1294
01:59:08.130 --> 01:59:12.770
Anthony Taylor: We do know where lat is. We saw that already. Ward?

1295
01:59:15.420 --> 01:59:16.090
Anthony Taylor: Huh?

1296
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:18.180
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1297
01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:22.819
Anthony Taylor: like, I said. I'm going to save us a little bit of time here

1298
01:59:23.340 --> 01:59:28.909
Anthony Taylor: and give you this whole block of actually the the rest of this code for this block.

1299
01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:33.640
Anthony Taylor: so that we don't all have. Sit here and watch me type it.

1300
01:59:37.760 --> 01:59:38.860
Anthony Taylor: There you go.

1301
01:59:40.100 --> 01:59:43.750
Anthony Taylor: So that is from here down.

1302
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:47.920
Anthony Taylor: just like, so. okay.

1303
01:59:49.160 --> 02:00:00.490
Anthony Taylor: so what do we do? So we got longitude, which is at this path. the temp which we did this one before. right? And we're just putting it into each list.

1304
02:00:00.940 --> 02:00:15.330
Anthony Taylor: And when we're all done we're gonna print it all out. So let's run this. This is quite a few executions. Right? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, like 10. Okay, so here you can see the whole list. And since we now have the list.

1305
02:00:15.720 --> 02:00:17.300
Anthony Taylor: we could create a data frame.

1306
02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:21.669
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So first let's turn it into a dictionary.

1307
02:00:25.310 --> 02:00:33.260
Anthony Taylor: and all we have to do is say, city colon cities my last

1308
02:00:35.690 --> 02:00:40.010
Anthony Taylor: olin at mom.

1309
02:00:40.780 --> 02:00:42.730
Anthony Taylor: Colonel.

1310
02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:47.680
Anthony Taylor: we're almost done. I can type. I can handle typing these up.

1311
02:00:49.630 --> 02:00:50.420
Anthony Taylor: maybe.

1312
02:01:00.770 --> 02:01:01.920
Anthony Taylor: and whipped

1313
02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:09.510
a.

1314
02:01:11.940 --> 02:01:13.720
Anthony Taylor: So now we'll create a table.

1315
02:01:14.350 --> 02:01:16.270
Anthony Taylor: Pd. Dot.

1316
02:01:18.340 --> 02:01:29.900
Anthony Taylor: I want to make sure everybody understands why this works right. Remember what we said in the beginning, a list of dictionaries, a dictionary of lists. This is just a dictionary. And these are all lists.

1317
02:01:30.530 --> 02:01:33.339
Anthony Taylor: So this is the column header. This is the data.

1318
02:01:33.610 --> 02:01:36.760
Anthony Taylor: That's why this works. Okay.

1319
02:01:38.630 --> 02:01:43.109
Anthony Taylor: so we're going to pass that dictionary in and then take a look at it.

1320
02:01:45.570 --> 02:01:48.170
Anthony Taylor: And that's it, guys pretty.

1321
02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:56.079
Anthony Taylor: So let me tell you, an interesting use for some of this stuff. So here's another cool Api use.

1322
02:01:56.290 --> 02:02:00.299
Anthony Taylor:  I have. We have a rewards program.

1323
02:02:00.540 --> 02:02:03.409
Anthony Taylor: Yes, I know. That seems kind of weird. We sell, you know.

1324
02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:07.250
Anthony Taylor: Hips. Okay. But for surgeons

1325
02:02:07.550 --> 02:02:09.530
Anthony Taylor: who use our product

1326
02:02:09.630 --> 02:02:14.720
Anthony Taylor: and buy our product right? They basically, there's a rewards program.

1327
02:02:15.170 --> 02:02:17.420
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And

1328
02:02:17.670 --> 02:02:24.300
Anthony Taylor: we were, I ripped this thing and it pulls from an Api, and it's like, Yeah, there's the data. And I had their

1329
02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:30.520
Anthony Taylor: their office address. which is cool. But we wanted to map.

1330
02:02:31.690 --> 02:02:36.819
Anthony Taylor: Now you can do that with just regular mapping software, but it's

1331
02:02:37.270 --> 02:02:53.170
Anthony Taylor: it's hard. But if you have latitude longitude you can do it in almost any song. So what I did is I went to Bing Api and passed in those addresses which return the latitude and longitude.

1332
02:02:53.760 --> 02:03:02.460
Anthony Taylor: put that in the data, augmented the data. so that now we had a report that showed pinpoint where every doctor's office was.

1333
02:03:03.570 --> 02:03:08.319
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And it's really cool. It's really simple. I mean, it's way. Better doing that

1334
02:03:08.390 --> 02:03:15.909
Anthony Taylor: than it is having somebody going out and manually trying to get the latitude longitude of hundreds of thousands of records.

1335
02:03:16.860 --> 02:03:24.240
Anthony Taylor: plus every time we got more. It just automatically called the Api, pulled back latitude longitude.

1336
02:03:24.530 --> 02:03:26.350
Anthony Taylor: dropped it into the database.

1337
02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:32.170
Anthony Taylor: Okay. cool implementation. Fairly simple.

1338
02:03:33.890 --> 02:03:35.699
Anthony Taylor: That's all I have for you guys today

1339
02:03:37.310 --> 02:03:48.900
Anthony Taylor: try, accept first thing, getting a class next class, there is a resource for try and accept it's not complicated. But it's important. So we will definitely cover.

1340
02:03:49.620 --> 02:03:50.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay, gang.

1341
02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:58.430
Anthony Taylor: I will see you. Is it Thursday already? I'll see you Monday. Have a great weekend.
