1
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.940
Anthony Taylor: And

2
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.750
Anthony Taylor: welcome to class everybody for unsupervised learning game. 2.

3
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:19.139
Anthony Taylor:  Good news is we're going to start the day right away with an activity. So first.

4
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:32.319
Anthony Taylor: let's talk about today's stuff. We're going to segment some data. We're going to prepare the data for complex algorithms. II don't like that. They use the word complex, because, to be truthful.

5
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:43.340
Anthony Taylor: it's just as easy to use these as it is to use K-means. But we are going to talk about. Probably the most important thing that they put in the middle of the second day

6
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:53.229
Anthony Taylor: is the importance of preprocessing data and not just for unsupervised learning. It's for all machine learning period.

7
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.590
Anthony Taylor: all of it.

8
00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.610
Anthony Taylor: Alright preprocessing data is about 80 to 90%

9
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.200
Anthony Taylor: of machine learning.

10
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.859
Anthony Taylor: Alright, that's just the way it is

11
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.730
Anthony Taylor:  we're gonna transform, categorical, variable. This is just a form of pre-processing.

12
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.780
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to scale. We're going to learn all about failing today.

13
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.529
Dipinto, Matt: Do you mean to be sharing?

14
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.380
Dipinto, Matt: Yes, I was showing you a wonderful slide, relaxing your face. It's fine.

15
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.180
Anthony Taylor: I appreciate that. And, you know, like a lot of expression.

16
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.409
Anthony Taylor: I was hoping you were looking in the reflection of my eye.

17
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:39.890
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So I said, segment, prepare preprocess, transform and standard scale.

18
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.869
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's what we're going to cover today.

19
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.470
Anthony Taylor: So let's recap

20
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.140
Anthony Taylor: So

21
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.560
Anthony Taylor: Thursday.

22
00:01:49.920 --> 00:02:05.899
Anthony Taylor: recognize difference between supervised and unsupervised. We did that actually, before Thursday we talked about what clustering is, and some of the ways that we can use it in data, science, right? Market segmentation, anomaly, detection, recommendation engines.

23
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.270
Anthony Taylor: We worked with K-means pretty much. Only it's the only algorithm we used.

24
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.560
Anthony Taylor: Okay was K-means, and it was pretty cool right? And then we start elbow graph

25
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.090
Anthony Taylor: to determine the optimal optimal number of clusters.

26
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.870
Anthony Taylor: Pretty cool. Right?

27
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.740
Anthony Taylor:  II

28
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.660
Anthony Taylor: okay, let's ask it. Why not? So give me some examples of how machine learning is used in data analytics.

29
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.330
Anthony Taylor: No.

30
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:56.459
Clayton Graves: I would imagine some of the some of the big ones like weather prediction stock markets. oh, man.

31
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.990
Anthony Taylor: stuff like that. Sales trends

32
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:09.029
Anthony Taylor: right? I mean, if you're in retail, what's the most important thing to you? Have the product on the shelf when they're gonna come, get it.

33
00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.259
Anthony Taylor: You want to be able to to accommodate the demand. As soon as you run out of something

34
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.770
Anthony Taylor: you start losing sales. If other people still want

35
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:26.360
Anthony Taylor: right bottom line down here in Texas. We're having a cold front at the moment.

36
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay, today or yesterday was like, 20 degrees.

37
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.160
Anthony Taylor: tomorrow will be 70.

38
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.419
Anthony Taylor: But yesterday was 20 degrees. Okay, every single grocery store ran out of water.

39
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.490
Anthony Taylor: milk and beer.

40
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:57.690
Anthony Taylor: Okay. the 3 main beverages of every good Texas follow right? Gotta have milk for the kids here

41
00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.430
Anthony Taylor: and water in case they shut off the water, and you have to fill the toilet so

42
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.690
Anthony Taylor: anyway. But that's reality. So could they be machine learning for that?

43
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.480
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. it's pretty easy to predict

44
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.510
Anthony Taylor: there's gonna be a freeze. Knock up the shelf.

45
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.900
Anthony Taylor: Okay, people are gonna panic. Now, we have a trend. We've seen a pattern. Let's do it.

46
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:31.139
Anthony Taylor: Okay, every natural disaster causes a panic. Covid and toilet paper

47
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.100
Anthony Taylor: covid. And so that one was an anomaly.

48
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:44.310
Anthony Taylor: No one understood that to this day no one understands that that is her mentality. Somebody

49
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.609
Anthony Taylor: went to a Costco, bought like 20 boxes of toilet paper.

50
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.710
Anthony Taylor: Other people saw it thought, Oh, my God. we're gonna run out of toilet paper!

51
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.810
Anthony Taylor: And then the whole world followed suit. I would bet you money, and we'll never know

52
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.860
Anthony Taylor: if the social media did not exist.

53
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.330
Anthony Taylor: that there would not have been the great toilet paper crisis.

54
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.900
Anthony Taylor: I'm almost certain of it. I mean there's no way for me to prove it, so I can say it all I want

55
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.380
Anthony Taylor: right. But I'm almost certain if you didn't know

56
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.799
Anthony Taylor: that you needed to buy extra toilet paper. You! How many of you did it?

57
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.000
Anthony Taylor: How many of you went out and bought extra paper just in case

58
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.200
Anthony Taylor: whoever bought the original extra for the paper was right. I didn't. Wasn't me.

59
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.130
Anthony Taylor: See? That's weird. Who did it? There's like 5 guys with a garage full of toilet.

60
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:45.230
Raugewitz, Tania: Yeah. So we buy from Costco. So we always buy in bulk, anyway. So we just maintained we maintained our

61
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:55.520
Raugewitz, Tania: but even Costco ran out. Tanya. Even Costco ran out. Oh, you! Had they limited it, you could not. You cannot buy more than 2 big bulbs, I know.

62
00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.430
Anthony Taylor: So anyway.

63
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:07.110
Anthony Taylor: okay, so with that being said, all these things machine learning. It's really an everything you do every time you pick up your phone every time you get an ad.

64
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:14.660
Anthony Taylor: Okay, when you're chatting. And it gives you a suggestion of what to say next. Right?

65
00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.189
Anthony Taylor: Chielin, AI

66
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.670
Anthony Taylor: combination of both.

67
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.100
Anthony Taylor: Okay,

68
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.689
Anthony Taylor: examples classifying predicting algorithm trade. Yeah.

69
00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:36.519
Anthony Taylor: Okay? I know we've done this a few times. But what is the difference between unsupervised and supervised labeled data and unlabeled data?

70
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:48.690
Anthony Taylor: That is pretty much it. That's the best way to say it. Okay, unsupervised. I love this. This is totally wrong. Only has labeled input data wrong.

71
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.729
Anthony Taylor: it only has.

72
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:58.109
Anthony Taylor: And we'll let me edit it. Unlabeled input data. So it's basically no labels. Supervise uses labeled data

73
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.569
Anthony Taylor: to to pass it in. I'll report a ticket on that.

74
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.519
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so let's do a quick warm up.

75
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.629
Oh, it's not an activity. It's just me.

76
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.280
Anthony Taylor: So as a reminder.

77
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:23.809
Anthony Taylor: we're just gonna do k-means. We're gonna use our elbow. It's gonna be cool. Okay. So we're gonna import pandas and kameez.

78
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:29.419
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna import our data as it been doing. II guess I'd better get that one to work first.

79
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:39.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay. pretty cool data. Alright. we're gonna create a list for our inertia values.

80
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.720
Anthony Taylor: And then a list of pay values from one to 10.

81
00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.319
Anthony Taylor: Right? Then we're going to loop.

82
00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:54.900
Anthony Taylor: passing in our K value and creating a

83
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.480
Anthony Taylor: a K-means fitted model

84
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.959
Anthony Taylor: for 10 different cluster values.

85
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:07.280
Anthony Taylor: Alright and then we're going to append the inertia value

86
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.609
Anthony Taylor: to our list.

87
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.790
Anthony Taylor: It'll be exciting. And it's done. Okay.

88
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:20.260
Anthony Taylor: Now, we're gonna create a dictionary with our K value when the corresponding inertia

89
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:24.769
Anthony Taylor: and make a little data frame and take a look at pretty.

90
00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:26.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

91
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:32.569
Anthony Taylor: Now, we'll make plot plot line X equals KY equals inertia run.

92
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:42.440
Anthony Taylor: So 3 or 4. Yeah. I would do it. One with 3, one with 4. Do a test. Everybody agree.

93
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.010
Anthony Taylor: You guys see it? 3,

94
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.169
Anthony Taylor: 4. One of those is it

95
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.190
Anthony Taylor: almost for sure? But

96
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.449
Anthony Taylor: is it possible that only one of those is right?

97
00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.250
Anthony Taylor: Let's talk about clustering real quick?

98
00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.429
Anthony Taylor: Could both of them be right.

99
00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.219
Masarirambi, Rodney: I mean, it depends on the infidel right?

100
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:15.469
Anthony Taylor: Or Rodney said it right. When you do your analysis you would look okay. I thought there would be only 3 groups, but you know what 4 makes sense.

101
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:21.249
Anthony Taylor: or I thought they would be 4. But these 2 groups there are pretty similar. Let's just do 3.

102
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:25.639
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's really a data analysis discussion at this point.

103
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.090
Raugewitz, Tania: Can I ask a question about that?

104
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:36.619
Raugewitz, Tania: So when you say so in your in the role of data analysts. And you're looking at 3 groups versus 4 groups.

105
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:45.770
Raugewitz, Tania: And you're saying, Okay, well, hmm, you know, I'm looking at the data, and that tells me it's more than likely 3 groups rather than 4.

106
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.710
Raugewitz, Tania: Are you just looking at like the

107
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:51.930
Raugewitz, Tania: like? What component are you looking at

108
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.409
Raugewitz, Tania: to see if it makes sense.

109
00:09:54.890 --> 00:10:04.440
Anthony Taylor: So since clustering really takes into account all of the values of your row of data, you're basically looking at all of the values of your row of data.

110
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:11.610
Anthony Taylor: So we we don't. In this particular example. We don't list the cloud, like, you know, some of our examples. We actually add the cluster.

111
00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.120
Anthony Taylor: You know the output.

112
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:19.249
Anthony Taylor: And you can like, go, okay, well, this is cluster one. This is cluster 2. What's the difference in these 2 records.

113
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.530
Anthony Taylor: you know, and why. And you try to

114
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:27.270
Anthony Taylor: basically as the data analyst, you're gonna look at the data and try to figure out why

115
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.820
Anthony Taylor: these 2 things went to different clusters. and then you'll apply a link.

116
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:42.610
Anthony Taylor: So it's basically it's a matter of looking at, you know. And if we let's pick something a little easier than this data. Customer segmentation. Okay, we look at their purchases

117
00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:51.550
Anthony Taylor: over time, and we say, this customer is a impulse buyer. This customer is a list buyer.

118
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.509
Anthony Taylor: right? Which is actually fairly easy to to, to differentiate in the data.

119
00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:10.030
Anthony Taylor: Okay, how do you think that is? Well, a list buyer, what would be the oh, go ahead. Time. Also, when you're looking at the data, there's there, typically is context as to what that data is referring to.

120
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:25.660
Raugewitz, Tania: So that's how you would make is like, okay, makes sense that there would maybe actually be an extra category. 4 versus 3 or categories, one and 2 are really similar. So there really are only 3 versus 4. But because there's context to what the data is referring to

121
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:40.290
Anthony Taylor: absolutely. And I'll finish up that example for those of you that want to understand what that data analyst is doing. So let's talk about that real quick. How would it if just common sense. This doesn't take marketing genius. Okay.

122
00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:44.900
Anthony Taylor: Impulse buyer versus a buyer that goes to the store with the list.

123
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:51.629
Anthony Taylor: What would be some things you would expect to see in the data that would differentiate those 2 things.

124
00:11:52.820 --> 00:12:00.119
michael mcpherson: what they purchased and where it's located in the store 100%. What is what was purchased. Was it on intact?

125
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:04.699
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but well, what else? There's another thing that would totally

126
00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:16.070
Clayton Graves: basic milk items.

127
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:23.630
Anthony Taylor: Well, now, they might have went there to buy Milton toilet paper, but if they bought milk and toilet paper, and

128
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:33.649
Anthony Taylor: you know and then you start looking, and you see that oh, well, look! They also bought these 4 items that that that appear to have been on sale or on end caps. Or

129
00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.679
Anthony Taylor: you know, they're they're seasonal.

130
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.939
Anthony Taylor: right? They sometimes seasonal, is often turns into an input doesn't have to be.

131
00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:48.809
Anthony Taylor: But these would be indicators to do it. List is typically it's it's going to be very specific.

132
00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:52.289
Anthony Taylor: right when I take a grocery list. I don't like him.

133
00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:54.189
Anthony Taylor: I don't buy soda.

134
00:12:54.360 --> 00:13:05.139
Clayton Graves: You could take a look at my shopping cart, and you know, see whether there there's there's Kansas spaghetti sauce, there's, you know.

135
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:11.000
Clayton Graves: Pickles, there's milk or cereal, whatever, and then you'll you'll see. Maybe there's a shirt

136
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:14.110
Clayton Graves: or something like that it's just

137
00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:18.189
Anthony Taylor: assured at a grocery store that would be weird, but

138
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.719
Anthony Taylor: a TV. Plus hasn't

139
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.820
Masarirambi, Rodney: which grocery store has got shirts.

140
00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:32.859
Anthony Taylor: Oh, mine does Fred Myers King super new every day, alright

141
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:52.929
Baro, Sonja: atp plus

142
00:13:53.010 --> 00:14:00.870
michael mcpherson: not one. No idea what we're talking about

143
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.839
Anthony Taylor: anybody. I don't like Bucky. It's a Texas thing.

144
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:08.650
Baro, Sonja: It is a Texas thing. I just had the Southern thing.

145
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:15.439
Anthony Taylor: I just had to make you smile, Anthony.

146
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:23.940
Baro, Sonja: Impulse 5 and the cleanest bathrooms on the freeway.

147
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:28.709
Anthony Taylor: That's it. alright. let's do our activity.

148
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:41.340
Anthony Taylor: Okay, let's do our activity.  open preview. So you got some, you gotta do k-means

149
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:43.630
Anthony Taylor: on used car data.

150
00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:52.430
Anthony Taylor: And basically they're gonna have, you do an elbow. There's not a whole lot to say. It's very similar to the activities you did the other day.

151
00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.119
Anthony Taylor: Don't look at that one. Let's look at this one.

152
00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.160
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, they're giving you a lot, too.

153
00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:12.720
Anthony Taylor: a whole lot. In fact, you have to do anything. Oh, okay, so they're gonna give you all of it. And then they're gonna have you do it again. but with different K clusters. Oh, that's pretty easy. Okay, cool

154
00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.109
Anthony Taylor: 15 min. That should be plenty of time.

155
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.649
Anthony Taylor: It's so weird. There we go!

156
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:22.079
Anthony Taylor: Welcome back everybody

157
00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:27.440
Anthony Taylor: that should have been fairly straightforward. Anybody should have any challenges with that one.

158
00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:33.509
Anthony Taylor: Nay. that makes me happy.

159
00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:38.659
Anthony Taylor: So let's go through it fairly quickly. Then

160
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:44.060
Anthony Taylor: pandas and K-means load our dangers

161
00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:49.199
Anthony Taylor: inertia. K. This was all given to you, anyway. But we're going to loop through.

162
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:55.590
Anthony Taylor: fill up our inertia list. create a data frame. create a plot.

163
00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:58.610
Anthony Taylor: 3 to 4.

164
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:09.109
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So when we get down here, it said, do one with 3. So we're gonna do one with 3 random state equals one

165
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:11.840
Anthony Taylor: fit it, predict it.

166
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:18.480
Anthony Taylor: copy it. add the predictions to the data frame and take a look at a couple of them.

167
00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.019
Anthony Taylor: Everybody good with that part. Anybody have any issue with that

168
00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:38.060
Anthony Taylor: I see nothing. And now let's look at a little scatter plot. Pretty good kind of obvious where it did. It splits, though. Huh? Oops!

169
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.680
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, nothing wrong with that.

170
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:49.350
Anthony Taylor: Let's do it with 4 same exact thing. Nothing changed. Just the number 4 was put into it.

171
00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.919
Anthony Taylor: Now we see there are 4 splits.

172
00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.750
Anthony Taylor: Is the data segmented better into 3 or 4 clusters live.

173
00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:03.909
Anthony Taylor: I would have to agree with this statement, because see how big the third cluster is here.

174
00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:16.030
Anthony Taylor: I would kind of agree that maybe this one is better suited for 4. But again qualitative, you know, just qualitatively deciding, this is not very bright.

175
00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:24.120
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you can make some assumptions to drive you of. Okay? Well, we'll start with 4

176
00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:27.550
Anthony Taylor: and see what the data looks like. Maybe

177
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.160
Anthony Taylor: alright. But real world.

178
00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.939
Anthony Taylor: you're still gonna look at the data. This graph doesn't tell you much. Anything.

179
00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Okay.

180
00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:50.669
Anthony Taylor: scaling data. We're not talking about finding how much it weighs. Because, trust me, the data is heavy.

181
00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.050
Anthony Taylor: Hello.

182
00:17:53.410 --> 00:18:03.379
Anthony Taylor: okay, so what does it mean?  we talked about this a little bit, I think, during project presentations.

183
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:12.660
Anthony Taylor: Cause some of you did this, Derek, I think your group did. I remember?  so

184
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.370
Anthony Taylor: actually, why is this talking about?

185
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:24.070
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So this is basically just showing you the K-means thing. This has nothing to do with standardization. It's reminding you how K-means work.

186
00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.189
Anthony Taylor: Get rid of

187
00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:29.160
Anthony Taylor: it, selects 2 random points.

188
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:40.599
Anthony Taylor: Excuse me, starts aligning data close to those points. As more data gets aligned, it moves the point until it comes up with 2 clusters or whatever clusters you ask for.

189
00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:47.720
Anthony Taylor:  I we're we're not even gonna discuss this today. I'm not even sure why they bring this up.

190
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.180
Anthony Taylor: I will tell you what it is.

191
00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:52.829
Anthony Taylor: Pretty sure we're gonna do it tomorrow.

192
00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:55.939
Anthony Taylor: Principal component analysis.

193
00:18:56.090 --> 00:19:00.710
Anthony Taylor: Let's say you have, like 50 columns of data.

194
00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:05.840
Anthony Taylor: 50 features that you want to cluster.

195
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:15.560
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now you go and you go do it. And it takes forever to fit. Train this model with 50 features.

196
00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.390
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Because it's a lot

197
00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.800
Anthony Taylor: takes a long time.

198
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:30.820
Anthony Taylor: Pca allows you to use an algorithm to shrink that down to as few as 2, you may lose a lot of

199
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:33.150
Anthony Taylor: accuracy, but you can do it.

200
00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:42.919
Anthony Taylor: But the reality is is again using it. You can get to a certain point and say, you know what I just, I'm good with 95% of the information.

201
00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:44.489
Anthony Taylor: But I want less college.

202
00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:53.929
Anthony Taylor: And you can tell Pca to do this, and it will go. Okay. Well, I got you down to 8 columns, and you still have 95% of of the accuracy.

203
00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:55.390
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

204
00:19:55.610 --> 00:20:03.649
Anthony Taylor: that's what Pca is. We're not doing that today. Not sure why they're showing that's but we will show you later.

205
00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:09.519
Anthony Taylor: You have that on the on the resources. And that broke my brain, and that was so much simpler.

206
00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:19.040
Anthony Taylor: My explanation. I'm pretty good at that. Thank you, Rodney. Pretty good at that. One more question.

207
00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:31.790
Baro, Sonja: So it helps you narrow down that the columns without modifying any of the data. It does it for you. Well, it does it for you. It actually turns it into numbers.

208
00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:34.299
Anthony Taylor: So what it does is it takes

209
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:40.950
Anthony Taylor: that data, I mean, without getting too much into how it works, it basically goes through. And it figures out

210
00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:44.470
Anthony Taylor: which columns carry the most weight in this

211
00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:45.530
Anthony Taylor: algorithm.

212
00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:50.160
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And it goes. Okay. Well, if I combine these 3 columns.

213
00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:54.540
Anthony Taylor: okay. that will still

214
00:20:55.120 --> 00:21:13.439
Anthony Taylor: be the most wait. And I can use that to to to continue doing. And it just figures this out for every grouping of columns until it gets the the number that you either ask what you can actually ask Pca to give you. I see a tiny you can. You can ask it to say, do it in 5 columns.

215
00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:18.979
Anthony Taylor: and then you get what you get right, or you can say I want 95%

216
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:29.320
Anthony Taylor: of the information, and then it gives you, however, many columns it can do that. So say you have 50 columns. And you say, I want 95, and it goes through. It goes there. We got 48 columns.

217
00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:32.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that we can't do better than that. That's possible.

218
00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:40.829
Anthony Taylor: right? But you can also go the other way. I want 5 columns. And it goes. I can get you 95. You're like, that's okay.

219
00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:42.800
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's fine.

220
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:48.590
Raugewitz, Tania: So when you're talking about it's going through and and assessing which ones have the heavier weight.

221
00:21:49.290 --> 00:22:07.339
Anthony Taylor: Is that is that does that mean it has more impact on what's going on, or what do you mean by classification, which is next week? But the wait is so

222
00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:14.300
Anthony Taylor: in an example, one of the ones we're. I think we're going to do that we used to do is diabetes prediction.

223
00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:18.330
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we have, like all of these

224
00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:24.080
Anthony Taylor: like biological measures, weight, glucose diet,

225
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:31.809
Anthony Taylor: blood pressure. You know all of these different measures. And we say we're gonna predict the likelihood. This person's gonna have diabetes.

226
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:36.390
Anthony Taylor: Alright? Well, the heaviest weight, without a doubt.

227
00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:37.830
Anthony Taylor: Wait.

228
00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:40.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Number one.

229
00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:46.400
Anthony Taylor: number 2. Glucose. Okay, what are their counts? Yes.

230
00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:54.289
Raugewitz, Tania: So then, is there a way that those that control that database, weight them themselves, prioritize those columns or

231
00:22:54.740 --> 00:23:02.319
Anthony Taylor: get coms themselves. If you were trying to optimize, you could do that normally, the model itself. Take care of that.

232
00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:15.439
Anthony Taylor: But as you guys are, gonna see, we're gonna do some encoding and stuff. So th those those are great questions and very important for optimization, which we have a whole week of optimization. So we will talk about that again.

233
00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:22.230
Anthony Taylor: But that's a great question, like, really insightful. Okay? So

234
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:29.150
Anthony Taylor: fact, I'm just gonna gloss over this because I'm pretty sure we're gonna cover it next class. So there's no reason to go in it. So

235
00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:34.390
Anthony Taylor: let's get to standard scale. So it's funny, tells you all about it. Dimension reduction.

236
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:40.769
Anthony Taylor: Right? Then it says, to do this, you need to do standard scaling, which is really what we need to learn right now.

237
00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:48.320
Anthony Taylor: All right, what is standard scaling? So standard scaling? This is probably a better example than that last one.

238
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:54.049
Anthony Taylor: We want number one. Everything has to be newer. Machine learning is nothing but math.

239
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:56.979
Anthony Taylor: You can't do math on words

240
00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.770
Anthony Taylor: just not doable.

241
00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:03.510
Anthony Taylor: Okay, there is a couple of models where we don't have to do this, but

242
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:09.520
Anthony Taylor: most of them we have to convert the numbers. so we will get to that that's called encoding.

243
00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:12.389
Anthony Taylor: We will get to that today. But

244
00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:21.900
Anthony Taylor: standards. So if we look at these numbers right here. Eps. time sales, total assets total debt. Now.

245
00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.540
Anthony Taylor: in math.

246
00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:31.090
Anthony Taylor: smaller numbers give smaller results.

247
00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.020
Anthony Taylor: Larger numbers give larger results

248
00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:36.640
Anthony Taylor: unless you're dividing

249
00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.090
Anthony Taylor: right? And then it's the opposite.

250
00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.390
Anthony Taylor: But we don't know.

251
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:45.670
Anthony Taylor: We don't know how the algorithm is going to use these numbers

252
00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:52.099
Anthony Taylor: could be a device, could be a numerator, could be a divisor, could be anything. So what do we want to do.

253
00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:55.670
Anthony Taylor: But what we want to do is come up with

254
00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:57.779
Anthony Taylor: a way to

255
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.140
Anthony Taylor: get these numbers in the same scale.

256
00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:12.729
Anthony Taylor: What does that mean? Well, that means we're gonna like, see how far they are from the meme. Usually this is one way we do it. and then we assign a value to it.

257
00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:15.819
Anthony Taylor: So these numbers. As an example.

258
00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:23.830
Anthony Taylor: we're going to do a method called standard scalar. And this is the numbers before. and this is the numbers after.

259
00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:30.210
Anthony Taylor: Now look at these numbers. They all look like they're the same number, like in the same range of each other. Right?

260
00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:35.820
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Well, with the standard scalar function, it is able to do this

261
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:37.220
Anthony Taylor: and

262
00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:45.630
Anthony Taylor: keep all of these numbers close, so that, like in this case, total assets with 222,000.

263
00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:55.410
Anthony Taylor: Okay, compared to Eps, which is 2. This 222,000 without question. is going to carry more weight.

264
00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:59.180
Anthony Taylor: whether it be positive weight or negative weight. Numerator, denominator

265
00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.390
Anthony Taylor: right?

266
00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:04.090
Anthony Taylor:  it's just gonna carry more weight.

267
00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:11.580
Anthony Taylor: There's no way around it. because it's so large. So by doing standard scalar. we can

268
00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:15.990
Anthony Taylor: make it so that everything starts at the same level.

269
00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:25.199
Anthony Taylor: And this number's not gonna carry extra weight just because it's big. Now, other examples of this, let's say you have.

270
00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:28.859
Anthony Taylor:  you're measuring

271
00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:37.440
Anthony Taylor: the length of your car in centimeters. Okay? And in the same row of data you have miles per hour.

272
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.010
Anthony Taylor: It's not unreasonable. right?

273
00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:46.979
Anthony Taylor: Not a reasonable have those 2 values in the same data, but they're completely.

274
00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:49.669
Anthony Taylor: ridiculously different numbers.

275
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:58.589
Anthony Taylor: Right? So by scaling it, we allow it to say, Hey, we know, these are different numbers. But now they're in the same range of each other. And it works

276
00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:00.740
Anthony Taylor: just works. Okay, yeah, click.

277
00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:07.030
Clayton Graves: So is it essentially sort of we were talking about weight.

278
00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:10.060
Clayton Graves: Is it essentially like redistributing the weight?

279
00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:19.240
Anthony Taylor: So that it's not in this case that's a great another great question. But no, in this case, it's actually it's it's literally taking the data

280
00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:21.829
Anthony Taylor: and coming up with

281
00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:28.559
Anthony Taylor: it has an algorithm that's going to recalculate the data and output it in such a way that

282
00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:34.259
Anthony Taylor: they are all in the same range. Okay, now, if we look at some of these numbers, let's look at this first row

283
00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:40.490
Anthony Taylor: right? So we see there's a point 0 5. There's a point 0 7, and then there's a point 1 1.

284
00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:48.220
Anthony Taylor: All right. Now to you and me. We're thinking decimals. That doesn't seem like very much

285
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:59.630
Anthony Taylor: compared to 2 to 222. But take away that decimal for a second. 575, 797, 1,134.

286
00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:06.049
Anthony Taylor: Now it's a lot larger right now. It still doesn't seem to be the same ratio. But that doesn't matter

287
00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:10.060
Anthony Taylor: the way the standard the standard algorithm works

288
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:15.989
Anthony Taylor: is that it understands that we've scaled this data and and gives it the proper weight.

289
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.800
Anthony Taylor: So it's not going to give it any extra weight because of its size. It's simply going to say, that's a bigger number.

290
00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.200
Anthony Taylor: And I don't care what size is.

291
00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.330
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Yes, Simon.

292
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:34.790
Baro, Sonja: So once, once you've done your analysis on this or clustering whatever we're gonna do.

293
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:45.179
Baro, Sonja: do you also then convert it back to where, when you're reporting out that way, people will know what you're saying like.

294
00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:47.310
Baro, Sonja: just go ahead.

295
00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:51.340
Anthony Taylor: Sort of okay. We don't always take it back out.

296
00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:54.969
Anthony Taylor: And and this is part of the problem with Ml, in general.

297
00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:59.590
Anthony Taylor: one of the biggest challenges with machine learning is interpretability.

298
00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:02.540
Anthony Taylor: This is what everyone's scared of with AI,

299
00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:08.699
Anthony Taylor: okay. AI is tremendously difficult to interpret.

300
00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.610
Anthony Taylor: In other words, we don't know why it works.

301
00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:24.130
Anthony Taylor: and that is a fact. The smartest people in the world are struggling with. Why, some of this stuff works. Okay? Which is what scares people?

302
00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:27.720
Anthony Taylor: Well, we don't understand it. But it works. And we like it.

303
00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:33.700
Anthony Taylor: Cool. Okay, we can explain everything.

304
00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:38.860
Anthony Taylor: but we can't explain why. Chapter 2 can write an M. And M. Solve

305
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.910
Anthony Taylor: nearly perfect

306
00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:48.380
Anthony Taylor: right? We just can't. I mean, we can't, but but not everything. A lot of things it's doing. People are just tripping up. They're tripping

307
00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:55.629
Anthony Taylor: so real quick. There's actually do. I have a perfect yeah, I do. Okay, I'm gonna get to how the standard scalar actually works in just a minute.

308
00:29:55.910 --> 00:30:10.650
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So the main thing is, if you have apples and oranges. We're gonna try this to to scale the data so that it can compare apples and oranges without, like, you know. Well, citrus, that's everything. No, it's not

309
00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:12.799
Anthony Taylor: right. It's just one thing.

310
00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:26.690
Anthony Taylor: So that's kind of you know where that goes. So we don't manually do this. We use pandas. And so this is basically what it's doing. So before scaling, we have like different values, maybe. And see.

311
00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:33.989
Anthony Taylor: okay. when we scale it, what it does is it aligns everything along the mean of that column.

312
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:41.230
Anthony Taylor: So it looks at that column of data, says, here's the mean, and it aligns it along that mean so

313
00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:45.010
Anthony Taylor: while these values are drastically different.

314
00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:49.690
Anthony Taylor: see here, you see, this one goes up to point 200. This one's

315
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:55.170
Anthony Taylor: point 1 2 5 1, 2, 5. But here they all go up to point 4,

316
00:30:56.010 --> 00:31:01.180
Anthony Taylor: because this is the distance from the mean, not the actual value.

317
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:04.329
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's just how it works.

318
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:07.190
Anthony Taylor: Basically. Yes, Clay.

319
00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:11.100
Clayton Graves: here's my! Here's my thing.

320
00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:22.500
Anthony Taylor: II get what you're saying, that that you know we don't understand how it works. It just works well, I mean. That's how it works right there.

321
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:25.929
Anthony Taylor: Oh, AI in general. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, okay.

322
00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:38.180
Clayton Graves: But and and this ties back to this, too. If I if I do this. you're scaling that data ceases to have

323
00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:45.819
Clayton Graves: obvious meaning to me. And at that point in time. how do I know

324
00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:50.029
Clayton Graves: that I'm on the right path with what I'm doing.

325
00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:56.010
Clayton Graves: If I can't understand what it is that I'm seeing anymore.

326
00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:04.789
Anthony Taylor: You still can't, because you can track those standardized values back to the original row.

327
00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:16.790
Clayton Graves: Does that make sense? Sonya was a asking about earlier, too.

328
00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:22.260
Clayton Graves: And it was the same question I had which? Why, I put my hand down. But

329
00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:24.849
Clayton Graves: yeah, that's the thing I mean, it

330
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:37.410
Anthony Taylor: doesn't mean anything. We can't interpret. Clayton. You can't interpret necessarily. Why? And, by the way, most of the machine learning models we're gonna do in the machine learning part of this class you can interpret. But

331
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:44.059
Anthony Taylor: in this case we can still take this row because we know the index of this row

332
00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:46.759
Anthony Taylor: and put it back into the state.

333
00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:50.290
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we can still do that here in this case

334
00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:52.299
Anthony Taylor: in AI, it's a whole different feature.

335
00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:59.320
Anthony Taylor: Alright in AI. There are relationships being found in the data that we didn't code.

336
00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:03.379
Anthony Taylor: We said. this is how you find relationships.

337
00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:10.130
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And AI took that. And then we gave it a bunch of data and said, Find relations.

338
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:14.459
Anthony Taylor: And it found relationships. And as some of em, we're going.

339
00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:22.050
Anthony Taylor: We don't know why it found how it found that relationship. Okay, and but

340
00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:34.379
Anthony Taylor: but once it finds the relationship, we can say, Oh, yeah, we should be able to track it down. We should. And I don't know, and I'm sure there are some things still that are just so

341
00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:39.439
Anthony Taylor: complex that they're having struggles, figuring out how it came up with that.

342
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:49.889
Anthony Taylor: But the bottom line is is this is why we have medicines and new things that are coming out like weekly. Now we have new medicines, new medications. No one ever thought of.

343
00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:55.780
Anthony Taylor: because these models are relating things that people just didn't relate

344
00:33:56.510 --> 00:34:03.419
Anthony Taylor: or like. Why are these 2 things coming together? Well, and the cool thing about these models? Is it really just comes down to

345
00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:05.540
Anthony Taylor: asking the right question.

346
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:10.909
Anthony Taylor: The information's there. It can answer any questions.

347
00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:12.750
Anthony Taylor: But you got to know how to act.

348
00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:16.490
Anthony Taylor: Prompt engineers $110,000 a year.

349
00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:17.600
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, Ron.

350
00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:22.859
Masarirambi, Rodney: so if we go back to that to the, to the broad.

351
00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:24.000
Masarirambi, Rodney: So

352
00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:30.520
Masarirambi, Rodney: we see this like office scaling. But let's say, for example, one of those values

353
00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:35.059
Masarirambi, Rodney: came out like that. Would that?

354
00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:46.299
Masarirambi, Rodney: Would that like? Would they say that there's an issue, or it could. That can't happen, because it's still gonna it's it's going to distribute the values equally

355
00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.529
Anthony Taylor: across the meat.

356
00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:59.269
Anthony Taylor: So, no matter what that means mean, and the distance from the mean is going to be distributed, no matter what that means. If that means one. Or if that means 1 million.

357
00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:10.770
Anthony Taylor: okay, it's gonna give us the distance from the mean of the value that we're using. Jennifer. You're my math person right, my super math person. Does this formula make sense?

358
00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:17.290
Jennifer Dahlgren: Sadly? Yes.

359
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:18.320
Anthony Taylor: alright, cool.

360
00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:22.500
Anthony Taylor: Tanya, you had a question, did you? Did I answer it by accident?

361
00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:28.770
Raugewitz, Tania: I yeah, I think it's it's all. It's other people have addressed it. And

362
00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:37.890
Raugewitz, Tania: oh, okay, I was just gonna say with that scaling, and whether we need to know the math behind it, like Jennifer does.

363
00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:46.390
Raugewitz, Tania: or knowing that it it just is, it just works. It's been validated, verified, and you have a python function. This is like

364
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:53.400
Anthony Taylor: most of the statistics and map that we're learning in Python. Python has functions to do it. You don't need to memorize

365
00:35:53.790 --> 00:36:03.900
Raugewitz, Tania: that it does it. And so, because it does that, then back to these numbers that look out of whack on

366
00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:07.029
Raugewitz, Tania: are are look really large on one table, and then

367
00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:13.580
Raugewitz, Tania: they're more in line after they've been scaled. Is that just way of making it

368
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:17.510
Raugewitz, Tania: a way for it to be within our our

369
00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:22.180
Raugewitz, Tania: vision. We we can do something with that, because they've all been normalized

370
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:27.059
Raugewitz, Tania: and relatable to each other now, and I go back to Clayton's

371
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:40.819
Raugewitz, Tania: presentation project, where, looking at the wealth and education, it, it looked like there wasn't anything there, but when they did scale it down. Then they could say, actually, we now can relate these numbers to each other.

372
00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:42.490
Raugewitz, Tania: because absolutely.

373
00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:45.850
Anthony Taylor: that was such a great example, too. And it really came down to

374
00:36:46.440 --> 00:37:04.800
Anthony Taylor: because some of the numbers were so big they were causing the the the models to the art. Well, in their case wasn't models, wasn't it. It was just charting right? So it was causing the charting to look totally different when when they standard when they scaled it, and they brought them all to the same scale.

375
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:13.209
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Then it was like, Oh, well, wait a minute. These, when you put these in the same scale. There's a very obvious

376
00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:29.450
Kevin Nguyen: difference. Okay, Kevin, you must have something you want to add. Yeah. So for the packages that we use numpy sciences, learn, you can look at the source code to see how they do it as well. So it's transparent.

377
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:39.610
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, because all of this stuff is is open source. You can absolutely look at

378
00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:45.409
Anthony Taylor: the original. I mean, if if anybody ever just wants to.

379
00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:51.689
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you can come in here and there it is.

380
00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:54.059
Anthony Taylor: Here's the source.

381
00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:59.200
Anthony Taylor: It's not too bad.

382
00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:03.939
Anthony Taylor: and it's his python guys. It's just Piper.

383
00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:08.760
Anthony Taylor: It's very well, it's not always by. But in this case it's just about

384
00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:10.770
Anthony Taylor: okay.

385
00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:15.240
Anthony Taylor: So anyway, you can always still do that. If you want to

386
00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.750
Anthony Taylor: do, you need to. No.

387
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:27.620
Anthony Taylor: okay, you need to know. You need to scale your data. Okay. Now, the second part of of of this process is standardization.

388
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:31.060
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Now, standardization is

389
00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:34.040
Anthony Taylor: also vitally important.

390
00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:38.260
Anthony Taylor:  hoping they're gonna give me a

391
00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:50.140
Anthony Taylor: yeah. So what standardization can do? There's a couple of things. So let's just look at this. We have actual data. It's all over place. Right? We have big numbers. We have low numbers. We have

392
00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:51.910
Anthony Taylor: negative numbers black.

393
00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:56.650
Anthony Taylor: So we scale it. Now, it's all within

394
00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:58.090
Anthony Taylor: 0 to one.

395
00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:00.410
Anthony Taylor: Okay, which is good.

396
00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:02.390
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

397
00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:09.399
Anthony Taylor: But it's not necessarily standardized. We just scaled it. So we got everything from the meet.

398
00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.840
Anthony Taylor: Standardization allows us to go another step

399
00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:22.359
Anthony Taylor: and say, Okay, now we're going to distribute the data so that all of it is between negative one and one

400
00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:26.689
Anthony Taylor: or between 0 and one.

401
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:37.439
Anthony Taylor: Okay, those are pretty much the main ones. There are others that go a little higher. But that's the main thing. So scaling gets us to here. Standardization gets us to here

402
00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:43.859
Anthony Taylor: and again. long as you remember, this is a step in doing machine learning.

403
00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:49.430
Anthony Taylor: Most important thing. just standardize and scale everything.

404
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:53.479
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Let's do it. Is there?

405
00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:59.690
Anthony Taylor: Okay? If it's numbers standardized, it's yeah. Well, they all are on the same scale. Now, yeah, that's okay.

406
00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.470
Anthony Taylor: Go ahead. Do it. Think I heard anything?

407
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:09.679
Anthony Taylor: Alright? it just. And it's consistency. And like, here's another great example, I mean, look at these numbers.

408
00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:13.200
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So now let me ask you a question of these numbers

409
00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.149
Anthony Taylor: which one should be scaled.

410
00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:19.510
Anthony Taylor: Should I scale them all

411
00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:24.000
Anthony Taylor: I mean, I did just tell you scale them all. But I really didn't need scale them all.

412
00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:26.920
Raugewitz, Tania: Special core

413
00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:30.089
Anthony Taylor: spending score definitely. And what else?

414
00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:33.889
Mason, Natalie: Income

415
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:39.520
Anthony Taylor: income. What about age? Why wouldn't I skill age? That's a small number, right?

416
00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:48.300
Anthony Taylor: What do you guys think who thinks we should scale age?

417
00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.529
Raugewitz, Tania: Do you scale anything with a number

418
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:52.650
Anthony Taylor: we can scale it.

419
00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:56.850
Anthony Taylor: But here, let me give you this is age a number we would do math on.

420
00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:13.630
Anthony Taylor: See? Natalie's like, sure. What kind of math would you do with Aids? Right? How many candles? Yeah. Okay. Number days. And how many candles? Number of days? Yeah. But in data, age is a categorical variable.

421
00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:15.669
Anthony Taylor: It's a label.

422
00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:21.460
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's describing something. It's not giving us a measurable count.

423
00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:26.650
Anthony Taylor: You could say, what's a measurable count of years or days or minutes. Well, alright, but

424
00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:36.649
Anthony Taylor: most cases it's just a descriptive, a descriptive, variable. Alright, so we wouldn't do it. Customer. Id. Why wouldn't we scale that

425
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:40.780
Baro, Sonja: it's a descriptor.

426
00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:44.559
Anthony Taylor: Same thing, right? It's just it has no mathematical

427
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:46.230
Anthony Taylor: value at all.

428
00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:51.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we can't. We're not going to use. We're just not gonna use it.

429
00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:53.170
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

430
00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:59.369
Anthony Taylor:  alright. So let's go do this in code. Now.

431
00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:11.509
Anthony Taylor: okay, so the main thing I want you guys to take away from all of this is. And and I mean because some of you are probably like banging your heads. Oh, my God, this is complicated. How is it? Do it? Don't

432
00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:12.970
Anthony Taylor: worry about.

433
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:15.040
Anthony Taylor: Just know

434
00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:26.319
Anthony Taylor: that when you do machine learning models, part of preprocessing your data is to do standard scaling. and it's as simple as what I'm about to show you

435
00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:29.120
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna load the data. Here's the data we got.

436
00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:36.379
Anthony Taylor: So of these fields. Are there any of them? I can't standardize and scale. or don't want to

437
00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:54.509
michael mcpherson: just just the index. You don't want to scale that. But everything else the index right? What about myth? Because it's numer? It's not numeric.

438
00:42:54.540 --> 00:43:00.269
Anthony Taylor: Right? So method. We can't standard scale delicate essence, good or delicate.

439
00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:01.910
Anthony Taylor: Della Cassin

440
00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:12.209
Baro, Sonja: the Lickerson. Yeah. Cause that's some kind of well, does that become a descriptor, or all of those are variable. You mean method or or delicacy.

441
00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:18.539
Baro, Sonja: I think, is a delicate, delicate test, and maybe I think it's just spelled wrong.

442
00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:22.069
Anthony Taylor: But the point is is that these columns are all

443
00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:28.959
Anthony Taylor: scale. So we're gonna do that. So we're gonna take a look. And we can see all of the integers in this case

444
00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:36.870
Anthony Taylor: makes sense alright. So we can look at the column names. So since we don't want method, we can just take this and grab.

445
00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:40.290
Anthony Taylor: we can grab the whole thing and then just remove method.

446
00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:49.330
Anthony Taylor: Then we can say so. One thing that's interesting about standard scalar is similar to our Ml. Models, we actually train it.

447
00:43:50.440 --> 00:44:02.400
Anthony Taylor: Now let me explain why we train it. Alright. What? First off somebody explain to me. what's the what? What do you think training is doing in the Ml. Models

448
00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:07.470
Anthony Taylor: when I say fit it go, son.

449
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:08.960
Baro, Sonja: refining it.

450
00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:12.520
Anthony Taylor: refining it. Okay? Into what?

451
00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:16.600
Baro, Sonja: And by gathering.

452
00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.959
Baro, Sonja: helping it find patterns.

453
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:26.599
Anthony Taylor: But it's doing that by creating an algorithm in background.

454
00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:31.050
Baro, Sonja: right? Future data.

455
00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:44.540
Anthony Taylor: Sorry, I thought. And is this where it's like it's removing the other things that don't matter. We're only talking about fitting right now, not necessarily fitting for standard scalar fitting for machine learning.

456
00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:48.939
Baro, Sonja: Yeah. So what it's doing is it's looking at the data. And it's coming up with

457
00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:59.210
Anthony Taylor: a mathematical algorithm in the background that when given the same data again. it can come up with the answer whatever that answer we ask, come up.

458
00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:04.130
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's what it's doing. So in this case

459
00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.000
Anthony Taylor: for standard scalar.

460
00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:10.639
Anthony Taylor: we're going to look at the existing data. We're going to train

461
00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:22.189
Anthony Taylor: the standard scalar model. and then in this case also transform. But normally we just fit, then transform this method. Lets us do both in one pass.

462
00:45:22.450 --> 00:45:25.920
Anthony Taylor: but it's going to train it on these columns

463
00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:30.079
Anthony Taylor: and then apply it. That's what transformed us.

464
00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:38.580
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then, when it's done, it looks like this. Now, why is that important? It's important. Because when we get new data.

465
00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:44.299
Anthony Taylor: we needed to give it the exact fame.

466
00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:46.080
Anthony Taylor: scaling method.

467
00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:49.640
Anthony Taylor: use exact everything to be the same.

468
00:45:50.510 --> 00:46:01.620
Anthony Taylor: Okay? No matter what the data values are, we needed to apply the same standard scalar method that it applied to our data, to our training data.

469
00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:08.759
Anthony Taylor: So that's why we have to train it. It's going to store it that trained model, if you will.

470
00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:13.660
Anthony Taylor: and that way we will be able to apply it to incoming data later.

471
00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:18.969
Anthony Taylor: because whole point of this is get the data in a way that our machine learning model can work.

472
00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:23.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay. alright. So

473
00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:29.629
Anthony Taylor: here, now, we're gonna what are we gonna do? We're going to basically add our method back on

474
00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:33.200
Anthony Taylor: to our data. Okay, actually, what did they do to your

475
00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:43.189
Anthony Taylor: oh, I see, it created some arrays. We're gonna put those into a data frame. There they are in the data frame. Now, we're going to put method back onto the table. Oh, wait.

476
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:45.160
Anthony Taylor: But before we do

477
00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:49.180
Anthony Taylor: new wham, whang! Move

478
00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:56.769
Anthony Taylor: method. Okay. I don't want anybody to get offended. It's called, get dummies.

479
00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:03.110
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so this is encoding

480
00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.300
Anthony Taylor: done the easy way.

481
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:15.690
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So Pd, get dummies. We're passing in a single column. This method column up here alright.

482
00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:22.370
Anthony Taylor: and what Pd get dummies is going to do is do what's called one hot encoding.

483
00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:25.920
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So these are the

484
00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:31.859
Anthony Taylor: we haven't applied it yet. But this is what it's gonna do. Okay, there's only 2 values

485
00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:33.790
Anthony Taylor: in this case.

486
00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:38.089
Anthony Taylor: And if it's this value, it's going to put

487
00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:39.200
Anthony Taylor: one.

488
00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:43.900
Anthony Taylor: If it's this value, it's going to put a one.

489
00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:46.739
Anthony Taylor: but the other value will be a 0.

490
00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:53.260
Anthony Taylor: Now I will tell you when there's only 2 values like you really don't need to have 2 columns

491
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:57.139
Anthony Taylor: when you're doing one hot encoding. And let me give you an example. Male female.

492
00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:00.850
Anthony Taylor: Alright! Well, alright, never mind.

493
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:03.969
Anthony Taylor: That. Used to be a really good example.

494
00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:09.299
Anthony Taylor:  on, off there we go on off.

495
00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:12.410
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if you know it's on.

496
00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:17.920
Anthony Taylor: it's on. If it's not on. it's off

497
00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:21.400
Anthony Taylor: right? Easy.

498
00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:28.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and so in this case, if it's not a rest cafe, it's a retailer.

499
00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:35.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if it's a rescue, it's not okay. So you don't really need to go. But

500
00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:36.420
Anthony Taylor: that's late.

501
00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:43.460
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So now, when we take a look, we see, and and the irony to it is, I don't like that. They're doing this Boolean thing. Yet

502
00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:49.919
Anthony Taylor: keep in mind that pandas displays booleans as the word

503
00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:54.620
Anthony Taylor: true or false. but in the background it's 0 and one

504
00:48:56.180 --> 00:49:00.169
Anthony Taylor: all right. So these are numbers, even though they don't look like numbers

505
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:02.329
Baro, Sonja: and just an hour

506
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:07.480
Baro, Sonja: quick question on that, then. So you don't have to convert.

507
00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:13.800
Baro, Sonja: because it's a Boolean, it doesn't. You don't have to convert anything to. It's already 0 and one, yeah.

508
00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:16.169
Baro, Sonja: it's just not displaying 0 1.

509
00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:22.200
Anthony Taylor: Right? Right? So now, if there were like 5 values in that column.

510
00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:27.659
Anthony Taylor: you would have all 5 of them would have their own column.

511
00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:32.829
Anthony Taylor: and each one, all of them would be false except for the one that's true.

512
00:49:35.370 --> 00:49:36.609
Anthony Taylor: Does that make sense?

513
00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:41.180
Anthony Taylor: All of them would be fun. We'll see another example of this. Don't worry.

514
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:45.290
Anthony Taylor: But the whole idea is is that we are creating

515
00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:48.889
Anthony Taylor: a column for every value, and we're only gonna put a one

516
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:55.189
Anthony Taylor: one hat encoding in the column that the value is present.

517
00:49:56.370 --> 00:50:07.710
Anthony Taylor: and that's it. Alright. alright! So this next one isn't everyone. Do so we'll do it all together. and it's going to do a lot of the stuff we just talked about. Okay.

518
00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:11.550
Anthony Taylor: so then

519
00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:13.450
Anthony Taylor: do it.

520
00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:19.910
Anthony Taylor: Anybody struggling with this concept? So far.

521
00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:23.930
Anthony Taylor: the most important thing is here, guys, it's step by step

522
00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:28.869
Anthony Taylor: as long, and I'm going to try my best to explain why you do it.

523
00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:31.030
Anthony Taylor: how it doesn't.

524
00:50:31.770 --> 00:50:38.090
Anthony Taylor: It's good to have a general understanding. but I wouldn't get too hung up on the math.

525
00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:43.220
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's not necessary to do this job. Not. And I mean

526
00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:44.490
Anthony Taylor: any of this job

527
00:50:44.610 --> 00:50:49.039
Anthony Taylor: like data analysts, data sciences. Even the data scientists don't need to know.

528
00:50:50.290 --> 00:50:53.160
Anthony Taylor: Alright, they just need to know that it does.

529
00:50:53.990 --> 00:51:01.909
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. So we're gonna import pandas. We're gonna import standard scalar. We're gonna do k-means again. So let's get those all in there.

530
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:09.690
Anthony Taylor: It says, read in the file. So that is our file. It's right here. So

531
00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:16.029
Anthony Taylor: so we're gonna do, they're calling it CC info, underscore. Yeah.

532
00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:19.780
Ecosystems.

533
00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:21.790
Anthony Taylor: Pd, dot.

534
00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:25.940
Anthony Taylor: We'll see as

535
00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:26.960
Anthony Taylor: me

536
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:31.859
Anthony Taylor: way too long way way too long

537
00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:41.059
Meredith McCanse (she/her): get Csq instead of Csc.

538
00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:42.819
Anthony Taylor: thank you very much.

539
00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:47.719
Anthony Taylor: Okay, let's see if that works. Look at that

540
00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:51.009
Anthony Taylor: alright. So here we can see right away. We've got

541
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:58.350
Anthony Taylor: got some education. We got marriage. We got age. We got Bill so right away. Tell me which of these

542
00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:01.019
Anthony Taylor: we need to consider for standard scale

543
00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:05.880
Meredith McCanse (she/her): bill, Emma, and

544
00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:10.530
Meredith McCanse (she/her): pay amount and limit balance

545
00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:14.650
Anthony Taylor: limit balance. Bill. Emer.

546
00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:17.539
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I would say, those for sure.

547
00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:24.660
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I'm not even sure what default is in this. Oh, default is probably, if they they defaulted on alone would be my guess

548
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:35.590
Anthony Taylor: or credit card. Maybe I don't know. Yeah, probably. So that might turn into an important thing later, we'll check it out. So let's do a quick

549
00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:39.019
Anthony Taylor: info on this one.

550
00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:46.539
Anthony Taylor: This just tells us our. So we know for sure, we gotta do something with these guys.

551
00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:56.489
Anthony Taylor: Let's see how many different categories are in education. So what are some ways we know how to do that where we can see all of the values in a column.

552
00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:00.580
Masarirambi, Rodney: the data frame dot column.

553
00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:06.489
Anthony Taylor: data frame dot columns. Well, that would tell us all of the columns.

554
00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:12.730
Anthony Taylor: But I want to see the data that's in that column. So I want to see the data in, let's say, education.

555
00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:15.550
Anthony Taylor: Anybody

556
00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:24.650
Anthony Taylor: there. It is nice call value. Count. Remember, this gives us like a distinct list with the counts.

557
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:29.910
Anthony Taylor: There we go. So you can see there's a secondary primary post. Grad. Oven.

558
00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:44.220
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So with that, it's telling us to do get dummies. That's just so. Education. underscore end code. It was Pd, dot get that meets

559
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:46.410
Anthony Taylor: and we're just going to pass in that column.

560
00:53:49.330 --> 00:53:54.160
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then, when we're done, let's just take a quick look

561
00:53:54.190 --> 00:53:57.149
Anthony Taylor: at our encoded data.

562
00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:00.959
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So here you see.

563
00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:04.009
Anthony Taylor: all 4 of those different values.

564
00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:07.959
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And only the one

565
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:15.609
Anthony Taylor: that is true is marked true. So if we were to look at the actual data.

566
00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:18.900
Anthony Taylor: oh, we didn't do a tail. Well, we have a tail.

567
00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:23.929
Anthony Taylor: Think we have it right here. Secondary, other secondary post-grad primary.

568
00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:30.670
Anthony Taylor: secondary, other secondary postgrad

569
00:54:30.970 --> 00:54:33.720
Anthony Taylor: primary. You guys see that.

570
00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:40.169
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so that's what one hot coding does for us. Now, let's just put this

571
00:54:40.550 --> 00:54:47.859
Anthony Taylor: onto our data frame. So we're going to do. CC, info, df equals. Pd dot concat.

572
00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:52.689
Anthony Taylor: Remember, we did Kincat a long time ago process so much grief.

573
00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:58.229
Anthony Taylor: CC, and so df, then we're going to add our education encode data.

574
00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:01.879
Anthony Taylor: And we're going to do this on axis one.

575
00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:07.060
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

576
00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:09.069
We'll get rid of

577
00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:13.959
Anthony Taylor: the education column. Now, we don't need it anymore. In fact.

578
00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:17.110
Anthony Taylor: it's kind of in the way. So we'll do.

579
00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:29.520
Anthony Taylor: hey?

580
00:55:32.170 --> 00:55:36.419
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then we'll take a look at our new fancy data frame.

581
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:44.079
Anthony Taylor: So here you can see we have numbers, numbers, numbers, other post-grad, primary, secondary. These are now one audit code.

582
00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:50.160
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now. what else do you guys think we need to do with this just

583
00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:53.429
Anthony Taylor: well, it kind of tells us, doesn't.

584
00:55:53.480 --> 00:56:00.719
Anthony Taylor: So it's telling us to encode marriage. Now we're just gonna assume you're either married or you're not.

585
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:11.120
Anthony Taylor: There is, no, it's complicated. Okay. none of those just doesn't exist. We haven't got to that level

586
00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:22.690
Anthony Taylor: of awareness yet. Okay, so we're going to create a function to do our encoding. Alright. So we'll call it encode marriage.

587
00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:26.780
Anthony Taylor: And to this function we'll pass in

588
00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:28.170
Anthony Taylor: marriage.

589
00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:34.130
Anthony Taylor: And we're basically just going to say if the value we pass in

590
00:56:34.970 --> 00:56:36.470
Anthony Taylor: equals. Yes.

591
00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:42.580
Anthony Taylor: then I'll return one

592
00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:44.940
Anthony Taylor: health

593
00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:49.810
Anthony Taylor: return 0.

594
00:56:50.410 --> 00:57:02.539
Anthony Taylor: So what's that going to do? It's going to replace all these yeses with ones and all these no's with 0 pretty cool. Right? So to do that, we just have to do an apply. So we're going to apply this

595
00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:06.489
Anthony Taylor: to the marriage column, do it in place

596
00:57:11.090 --> 00:57:12.410
Anthony Taylor: and

597
00:57:17.970 --> 00:57:20.190
Anthony Taylor: dot apply

598
00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:30.310
Anthony Taylor: and go. So we're gonna call our function we just made. And then we'll take a look at the new cool data frame. And there you go. So now, marriage is a number.

599
00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:33.829
Anthony Taylor: Okay, one to 0.

600
00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:39.070
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Can you scroll up and show that we scroll up and show the code there for a sec. Thanks

601
00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:40.590
Anthony Taylor: this one. Sure.

602
00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:44.200
I

603
00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:47.610
Anthony Taylor: sometimes, I see.

604
00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:50.820
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Thank you.

605
00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:59.529
Anthony Taylor: No problem. Okay, so back to our original question, what do we need to scale? I'm going to stick with what you guys said at the beginning limit amount.

606
00:57:59.690 --> 00:58:14.060
Anthony Taylor: our limit balance fill amount payment amount. Okay? So let's knock it down. So we're gonna do. CC info. underscore data underscore scale.

607
00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:19.790
Anthony Taylor: And we're going to say, standard scalar dot

608
00:58:20.170 --> 00:58:22.660
Anthony Taylor: fit underscore transform.

609
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.149
Anthony Taylor: It's funny. I used to tell them that was so silly, anyway,

610
00:58:29.250 --> 00:58:30.460
Anthony Taylor: bracket bracket.

611
00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:34.529
Anthony Taylor: So 2 brackets, because we're going to pass in more than one column.

612
00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:41.899
Anthony Taylor: remember. So we need to pass in an array or a list into our brackets. So we're going to pass in

613
00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:44.760
Anthony Taylor: limits. Balance.

614
00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:48.900
Anthony Taylor:  hi! Yang!

615
00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:53.760
Anthony Taylor:  Fill them out

616
00:58:57.320 --> 00:59:02.190
Anthony Taylor: and pay him out. Oh, I messed something up big time right there.

617
00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:04.160
Anthony Taylor: Huh?

618
00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:09.949
Anthony Taylor: So before I run this, I'm gonna do some. I wanted you guys to see what I just did there.

619
00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:12.510
Anthony Taylor: So I accidentally hit run.

620
00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:14.880
Anthony Taylor: So I ran that code.

621
00:59:18.110 --> 00:59:19.759
Anthony Taylor: Well, maybe I didn't.

622
00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:25.230
Anthony Taylor: Looks like I did, though.

623
00:59:29.530 --> 00:59:31.789
Anthony Taylor: Huh? I guess I didn't.

624
00:59:33.370 --> 00:59:44.160
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright, we're okay. If I would have accidentally ran it if it would have worked. Okay, what would have happened? Oh, oh, maybe I did, because I'm doing it to this one.

625
00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:45.320
Anthony Taylor: Here, let's take a look.

626
00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:46.930
Baro, Sonja: Thank you.

627
00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:49.120
Baro, Sonja: Mine's showing.

628
00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:53.319
Baro, Sonja: But there's this an array that's supposed to display

629
00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:57.100
Anthony Taylor: right right here. Yeah.

630
00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:06.120
Anthony Taylor: yeah, see, I've already. I accidentally made it when I only had one column in there which basically applied. It's only one column not good.

631
01:00:06.330 --> 01:00:11.879
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now the good news is, as we weren't overwriting our data frame, we didn't break anything.

632
01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:17.949
Anthony Taylor: but if I was overwriting our data frame, I'd have to go back and start from the top. Come all the way back down.

633
01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:22.459
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But we didn't. So we're okay. So

634
01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:29.040
Anthony Taylor: So now we can run it, and we'll see, all 3 columns have been scaled.

635
01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:36.040
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now that we have them scaled, we can add them back to

636
01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:41.430
Anthony Taylor: our original data frame. Now, the way we do that

637
01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:51.200
Anthony Taylor: is, we create a data frame from this. Okay?

638
01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:54.070
Anthony Taylor: And then we basically

639
01:00:54.130 --> 01:01:01.610
Anthony Taylor: are going to append it into our old data frame. And this is just a step. It's it's awful. But it's okay.

640
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:13.799
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So we're gonna say, Pd, dot data frame. And in here we're just going to pass in our data and tell it what columns cause. See, they don't have column headers into it.

641
01:01:14.050 --> 01:01:21.070
Anthony Taylor: So columns equals single bracket is just a list of columns limit, though.

642
01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.259
Bill amounts

643
01:01:28.110 --> 01:01:29.460
Anthony Taylor: and pay him out.

644
01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:33.499
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So that created the new data frame.

645
01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:36.939
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to replace

646
01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:44.760
Anthony Taylor: these same columns. So basically, we're going to replace this column.

647
01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:48.589
Anthony Taylor: this column and this column with the data

648
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:51.869
Anthony Taylor: that we just create. So to do that.

649
01:01:53.090 --> 01:01:55.440
Anthony Taylor: we're going to do the name of the data frame

650
01:01:57.660 --> 01:01:59.930
column we want to replace.

651
01:02:02.450 --> 01:02:08.500
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to call, put the the column from the other data frame in its place. So we're going to do?

652
01:02:14.350 --> 01:02:16.369
Anthony Taylor: Okay, does that make sense to everybody?

653
01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:22.009
Anthony Taylor: So we, we made this new feel.

654
01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:32.030
Anthony Taylor: These are now the 3 columns. We turn those into a data frame. And now we're replacing the old value with the new value.

655
01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:40.200
Anthony Taylor: And that's it. And we're going to do that for all 3 columns. So I'm just going to copy paste. And then, just

656
01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:52.280
Anthony Taylor: okay. And now we can look at our data frame.

657
01:02:53.130 --> 01:02:54.340
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, Mike.

658
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:56.609
michael mcpherson: can you do that all in one line?

659
01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:07.409
Anthony Taylor:  you mean this part of it. maybe this part and this part. No.

660
01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:13.040
Anthony Taylor: this part. Probably

661
01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:20.389
michael mcpherson: I have to do like a dictionary or something. You probably do almost the same amount of type.

662
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:25.219
michael mcpherson: So I don't know if it benefits you a lot. But

663
01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:29.740
Anthony Taylor: that's probably like a good Chat Tpp question, because they would know that obscure stuff.

664
01:03:30.490 --> 01:03:32.760
Anthony Taylor: But now let's look at our data.

665
01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:45.839
Anthony Taylor: numbers, numbers numbers. even though it's true, false. scaled numbers. So we have nothing that's like outrageous. The only thing that's kind of weird here is age.

666
01:03:46.530 --> 01:03:48.430
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're not gonna worry about it.

667
01:03:49.030 --> 01:03:52.549
Anthony Taylor: Brian. No worry about it. We'll just leave it alone.

668
01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:56.570
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So now our data is ready.

669
01:03:56.580 --> 01:04:08.659
Anthony Taylor: So guys hear this. it's one of those moments. Okay. preprocessing is 80% of data. Science.

670
01:04:10.370 --> 01:04:13.110
Anthony Taylor: Okay. models are simple

671
01:04:14.770 --> 01:04:18.520
Anthony Taylor: getting the data ready and cleaned up. That's the work.

672
01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:24.790
Anthony Taylor: Alright. And that's also AI data science. AI, same thing.

673
01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:26.970
Anthony Taylor: AI is data. Science.

674
01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:33.299
Anthony Taylor: Okay? I mean. Granted. Right now, we're doing more predictive stuff. But we'll get to the AI side

675
01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:40.340
Anthony Taylor: first. You got to know this. So we're just going to do the same thing we've been doing all day. Yeah, Rodney.

676
01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:45.730
Masarirambi, Rodney: So for this part. it kind of seems like

677
01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:53.320
this might be worthy of like making like a shortcut which you can paste and just put everything in there. Right cause.

678
01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:57.809
Anthony Taylor: I love this guy. Yes, we will learn that. I promise.

679
01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:02.780
Masarirambi, Rodney: What we will eventually learn is that you can create a pipeline

680
01:05:03.210 --> 01:05:05.810
Anthony Taylor: that takes all of these steps

681
01:05:05.830 --> 01:05:11.340
Anthony Taylor: and basically makes it into a single thing that you just basically pass the data into.

682
01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:21.090
Anthony Taylor: Okay, maybe some more information. But way simple. But we gotta learn how to, you know. Walk up the steps before we can build the elevator.

683
01:05:22.270 --> 01:05:31.409
Anthony Taylor: Okay. I don't know if that's a real thing. That's a saying. I just made it up. Think I'm ready to become an old country dude. Now

684
01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:38.900
Masarirambi, Rodney: you say that.

685
01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:43.900
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I'm almost smart as Jack. Jp.

686
01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:46.300
Anthony Taylor: all right. I

687
01:05:46.650 --> 01:05:47.380
I love that.

688
01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:58.209
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So now we're just gonna do what we've been doing all day. We're gonna create a model. I mean, we could even go grab this from our old code, right? Because it's exactly

689
01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:00.549
Anthony Taylor: the same. Nothing is different

690
01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:03.380
in underscore

691
01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:07.369
Anthony Taylor: clusters. We're gonna make it. I

692
01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:09.720
Anthony Taylor: we're going to do in init

693
01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:12.889
Anthony Taylor: equals. Auto

694
01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:17.489
Anthony Taylor: and random states was what

695
01:06:18.010 --> 01:06:18.840
Anthony Taylor: and

696
01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:22.400
Anthony Taylor: from there we got to fit it

697
01:06:25.610 --> 01:06:26.970
Anthony Taylor: with our data.

698
01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:32.679
Anthony Taylor: And last, but not least, we're going to append the inertia.

699
01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:35.270
Anthony Taylor: I spelled

700
01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:38.570
Anthony Taylor: what nobody caught that

701
01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:43.510
Anthony Taylor: inertia dot append

702
01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:47.359
Anthony Taylor: a underscore model dot.

703
01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:50.960
Masha.

704
01:06:51.530 --> 01:06:54.229
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so there's our loop.

705
01:06:55.390 --> 01:06:58.770
Anthony Taylor: And then, now, we can create our little data frame.

706
01:06:59.590 --> 01:07:02.750
Anthony Taylor: We're almost done. Guys. One question, yeah.

707
01:07:02.930 --> 01:07:19.719
Masarirambi, Rodney: When when you were doing it because this came up like whilst we're in our group. When you did K. Model fit, there was K. Model fit predict, will that do? Both of them at the same time fit and predict it. Yes, it will just like fit transform that did for standard Scalar. Yes, it's exactly the same thing

708
01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:31.150
Anthony Taylor: but and and and on the cont on the the flip side, if you go standard scalar fit right and save that to a variable, then you could apply that to something separate

709
01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:33.849
Anthony Taylor: like not all in one line. But

710
01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:42.900
Anthony Taylor: I mean honestly, and it's just habit. I think we do them separately, just because we like the whole model fit, predict model fit. Predict.

711
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:46.040
Anthony Taylor: We want you guys to just say that in your sleep.

712
01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:52.490
Anthony Taylor: So we just keep making you say it. Yeah, Meredith.

713
01:07:53.460 --> 01:08:04.439
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I have a question about the where you created the empty list, the inertialist. The name of that like Bob, does it?

714
01:08:04.550 --> 01:08:07.550
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Could it be named anything. And we're just calling it okay?

715
01:08:08.030 --> 01:08:17.159
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Because down below, so at the beginning, you're referencing the list. But inside the parentheses when you do dot inertia. That's not.

716
01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:20.989
Meredith McCanse (she/her): That has nothing to do with the name of the list. That's the way that you call the

717
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:27.149
Anthony Taylor: that's the so the when we fit the model. It creates a property

718
01:08:27.210 --> 01:08:39.930
Anthony Taylor: called inertia. So what this is doing is we're taking the model that we fit, and we're getting the property of inertia and putting it in this list that we created. we just called an inertia to make it easier.

719
01:08:40.279 --> 01:08:48.630
Anthony Taylor: That's it. But but we're gonna leave it, Bob, now, because you made me think of Bob. And well, frankly, I missed all.

720
01:08:49.649 --> 01:08:52.079
Anthony Taylor: Haven't, said Bob. In days.

721
01:08:58.029 --> 01:08:58.790
Anthony Taylor: Nope.

722
01:09:02.359 --> 01:09:08.009
Anthony Taylor: Oh, my gosh! Am I like so it's like something well on the keys here. Can't get anything to work.

723
01:09:09.870 --> 01:09:12.479
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then

724
01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:20.009
Mason, Natalie: that needs to be data, not date, same

725
01:09:20.370 --> 01:09:25.040
Anthony Taylor: dug on it. I don't even know what I'm doing anymore.

726
01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:27.879
Anthony Taylor: Date got this coach.

727
01:09:29.050 --> 01:09:31.630
Anthony Taylor: I think. Look at that. I can't get. It.

728
01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:40.510
Anthony Taylor: Must be break time. Okay. Oh. Bob is not to find. Oh, I actually have to run this. And then this

729
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:42.630
Anthony Taylor: amendments. There we go.

730
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:56.539
Anthony Taylor: Okay. all right. And last, but not least, we're gonna plot it again. You can copy this from every single homework we've done today. and our homework activity in the last like 2 days.

731
01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:04.950
Anthony Taylor:  And and and it'll be exactly the same.

732
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:21.029
Anthony Taylor: you know. I don't care about the rest.

733
01:10:22.670 --> 01:10:28.439
Anthony Taylor: There we go. So yeah, 3, 4 again. Oh, my God, really

734
01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:34.780
Anthony Taylor: okay. Well, you know what everybody join me as we go back to the last activity

735
01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:39.520
Anthony Taylor: we did as a group or right here. And we're going to grab

736
01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:44.190
Anthony Taylor: this code

737
01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:56.309
Anthony Taylor: right here. since this is a 3 cluster and go back to our code, there's no point in rewriting. Code makes no sense.

738
01:10:57.570 --> 01:11:03.360
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to go oop, and the only thing we need to do is change this

739
01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:06.799
Anthony Taylor: and this

740
01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:10.220
Anthony Taylor: and this.

741
01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:12.870
Masarirambi, Rodney: Would you like a shortcut? For that

742
01:11:13.690 --> 01:11:17.019
Anthony Taylor: we could, we could have totally made this into a function, a hundred percent.

743
01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:23.290
Masarirambi, Rodney: Oh, me, oh, a hundred percent guy would. Oh, no, I meant a shortcut for changing all those at the same time.

744
01:11:23.930 --> 01:11:27.349
Anthony Taylor: Oh, yeah, we could have done that. I didn't. But we could.

745
01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:33.560
Anthony Taylor: So let's you know what, let's go, how to change all of these variables to just to keep it

746
01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:35.770
Anthony Taylor: similar.

747
01:11:36.690 --> 01:11:38.709
Anthony Taylor: Okay, let's see.

748
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:40.019
Anthony Taylor: Oh, they're doing.

749
01:11:41.950 --> 01:11:45.929
Anthony Taylor: K, 3. And then this would be.

750
01:11:47.710 --> 01:11:50.169
Anthony Taylor: is this k, 3, 2 k, 3.

751
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:52.220
Anthony Taylor: Now.

752
01:11:53.770 --> 01:11:55.659
Anthony Taylor: no, this would be CC. Info.

753
01:12:07.630 --> 01:12:16.579
Anthony Taylor:  Alright, as you do.

754
01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:23.050
Anthony Taylor: And then. last, but not least.

755
01:12:24.170 --> 01:12:27.799
Anthony Taylor: we'll grab the same. Actually grab the thought up above one or 2.

756
01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:30.599
Anthony Taylor: Oh, no, we're doing a scatter on this one.

757
01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:38.080
Anthony Taylor: Take a look. Oh. we didn't call it customer segments. I called it okay, underscored.

758
01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:41.480
Anthony Taylor: What's missing

759
01:12:42.190 --> 01:12:46.040
Dipinto, Matt: different name for your data frame, don't you?

760
01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:52.699
Anthony Taylor: It's only problem with copy and paste in that way is you get some weirdness. There you go.

761
01:12:54.480 --> 01:13:03.349
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So yeah, the only thing we did is a shortcut. There is. We went and copy code we already had. But could you make this into a function? Sure you could.

762
01:13:15.050 --> 01:13:20.089
Anthony Taylor: That's all I need. For some reason my elbow curve ended up with a straight line.

763
01:13:20.670 --> 01:13:23.119
Anthony Taylor: Oh, my God, that's weird!

764
01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:29.869
Anthony Taylor: Just messing, Buddy. I don't know. You want me to take a look. Hold on one sec. Let me finish filling this out.

765
01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:34.140
Anthony Taylor: Actually, will it make this even easier? I'm just gonna call this CC info

766
01:13:35.150 --> 01:13:39.100
Anthony Taylor: underscored the yeah. So now.

767
01:13:53.890 --> 01:13:55.679
Anthony Taylor: but and so there's your function.

768
01:13:57.130 --> 01:13:59.460
Anthony Taylor: So now you could just pass in

769
01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:01.659
mean it

770
01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:06.990
Anthony Taylor: parentheses. CC,

771
01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:08.590
there.

772
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:10.740
Anthony Taylor: it's good enough.

773
01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:14.910
and there you go.

774
01:14:16.210 --> 01:14:21.379
Anthony Taylor: Now it does that whole K-means model for you. and adds the column to the end.

775
01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:34.350
Anthony Taylor: and then for for the plot. I mean honest to God, you could do the same thing. You could just create, share, turn this into a function, and pass in like the name of the data frame or something.

776
01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:35.850
Anthony Taylor: Wow!

777
01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:42.080
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Hi, what was Clayton? What was it you and me? What was you said?

778
01:14:42.730 --> 01:14:46.080
Clayton Graves: Oh, you wanted to show us your crazy line.

779
01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:50.360
Anthony Taylor: not as bent as I should be, boss.

780
01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:05.919
Anthony Taylor: That is definitely a straight line. Most likely your inertia is wrong. Scroll up

781
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:14.310
Anthony Taylor: per IK. Oh, right there. See where you have in clusters. PIN clusters equals. You. Put a one there, put either.

782
01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:19.030
Anthony Taylor: There you go.

783
01:15:24.210 --> 01:15:25.950
Clayton Graves: Oopsie.

784
01:15:26.250 --> 01:15:28.359
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, redo that there you go.

785
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.570
Clayton Graves: Oh, that's much better.

786
01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:36.930
Anthony Taylor: That is way more bent. Thank you.

787
01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.110
Anthony Taylor: Hi.

788
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:42.259
Anthony Taylor: Hi! So any questions about that

789
01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:45.450
Anthony Taylor: standard scalar

790
01:15:45.840 --> 01:16:00.700
Baro, Sonja: can you get dummies? Yes, sorry. I couldn't keep up with every. That's okay. You're gonna get it across. Okay? Cause I wasn't sure if we were going to use it for another exercise tonight.

791
01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:05.340
Anthony Taylor: probably

792
01:16:05.650 --> 01:16:16.780
Baro, Sonja: I can push it while you guys are break if you really want. But I don't think you need it, or just leave it up during break. Or yeah, I'll leave it. I'll leave it up. What? That right? You want me to leave up the function, or the one without the function.

793
01:16:17.310 --> 01:16:19.099
Baro, Sonja: without the function.

794
01:16:20.210 --> 01:16:23.409
Anthony Taylor: dang or with with the function.

795
01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:29.879
Baro, Sonja: I have the function I need above the function.

796
01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:31.170
This part.

797
01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:44.580
Baro, Sonja: yeah, creating, creating, creating a loop. Well, like I said this, this literally need to copy and paste this from any of the activities. Just change the data frame in.

798
01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:50.370
Anthony Taylor: that's it. And then the next one, too. I mean. Don't call it Bob.

799
01:16:50.640 --> 01:17:03.980
Baro, Sonja: if you want to use the one from the other activity. Yeah, I'm missing all the stuff at the top, the data pre processing, so I can't run any of this

800
01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:11.760
Anthony Taylor: real quick.

801
01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:17.260
Anthony Taylor: I'll just push it real quick. It's a big deal. I'll just do a quick push of the stuff up till now.

802
01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:27.050
Anthony Taylor: And you guys can go on break until 9 or 8 20. Okay, yeah, I'll see you guys at 8, 20,

803
01:17:29.190 --> 01:17:35.760
Anthony Taylor: or whatever you would have called what I just tried to do sounded like rhythmic screaming. But

804
01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:41.350
Anthony Taylor: I know that's not true, because I have 0 rhythm. I cannot be alright. Here we go.

805
01:17:42.510 --> 01:17:44.680
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So

806
01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:49.700
Anthony Taylor: I love this line. It's an understatement. I think I must have skipped something here. I

807
01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:56.329
Anthony Taylor: preprocessing is literally everything not just important, vital.

808
01:17:59.270 --> 01:18:02.969
Anthony Taylor: We come to the end of today's activities.

809
01:18:03.670 --> 01:18:07.570
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna talk about 2 new algorithms.

810
01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:13.870
Anthony Taylor: Okay? K means we pretty much beat it to death. Honestly for clustering. It's very good.

811
01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:28.659
Anthony Taylor: It does a nice job. Most of the time. It's sufficient. Okay. but we're gonna talk about 2 other ones. These are not the only 2 other ones. They're just 2 other ones that do it. Slightly

812
01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:29.670
Anthony Taylor: different

813
01:18:31.090 --> 01:18:32.060
Anthony Taylor: birch

814
01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:44.510
Baro, Sonja: and

815
01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:50.309
Anthony Taylor: balanced, integrative reducing and clustering, using hierarchies.

816
01:18:50.410 --> 01:19:03.039
Anthony Taylor: This is the key difference between the K-means and birch K-means is simply a clustering algorithm. It brings things together based on the mean value of center of

817
01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:04.440
Anthony Taylor: of the cluster.

818
01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:09.250
Anthony Taylor: Birch actually creates hierarchies.

819
01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:18.309
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this, then this, then this, then this, in fact, I don't think we have this demo at least today.

820
01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:22.330
Anthony Taylor: But you can even create a visualization showing

821
01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:26.350
Anthony Taylor: the hierarchical tree that it creates.

822
01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:28.200
Anthony Taylor: It's kind of interesting.

823
01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:42.130
Anthony Taylor: basically just says, Hey, these 2 things are really close to each other. And these 2 things branch over. And then these 2 things are close to these 2 things. and then these 4 things are close to these 10 things, and then these 10 things, and so on, and so

824
01:19:42.510 --> 01:19:53.140
Anthony Taylor: until it gets to like 2 giant clusters, or however many it decides you need  So it uses hierarchical clustering.

825
01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:59.459
Anthony Taylor: it. It often starts out with many, but as it's learning, it starts combining, combining, combining

826
01:20:01.090 --> 01:20:03.560
Anthony Taylor: until you have whatever left out

827
01:20:03.970 --> 01:20:09.740
Anthony Taylor: the inventors. They designed it. So the reason virtually even exist is because pay means

828
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:15.920
Anthony Taylor: more data you get are the more columns you get and the more data you get the worse it performs.

829
01:20:16.030 --> 01:20:20.699
Anthony Taylor: not in its clustering capabilities, but just in the time it takes to train.

830
01:20:21.310 --> 01:20:26.770
Anthony Taylor: So birch. actually is fairly memory light.

831
01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:32.920
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's not too bad. Deals very well with large data.

832
01:20:33.810 --> 01:20:41.279
Anthony Taylor: Alright. alright! A glomer little press string. It's like birch.

833
01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:46.580
Anthony Taylor: Couple of other points. You do not give it a cluster, count. You don't with virt, either.

834
01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:53.159
Anthony Taylor: It comes up with its own cluster, count. You can tell it. I want you to end

835
01:20:53.270 --> 01:21:04.239
Anthony Taylor: with a certain number of clusters, and it will, if it can. That make sense, you say I want to, and it can't get down to 2. It just won't do it, it'll stop it, whatever it can.

836
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:11.029
Anthony Taylor: Sometimes there isn't the single. So the reason why we show you this stuff is because

837
01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:15.380
Anthony Taylor: while K-means would probably handle most of your clustering needs.

838
01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:18.439
Anthony Taylor: You may come up with something that hey? I want to try this.

839
01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:20.279
Anthony Taylor: Try it.

840
01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:31.429
Anthony Taylor: and you're probably thinking, well, wouldn't that be a lot of work? Well, you're gonna see, it's actually not. Why wouldn't you use birch or the other one as opposed to to K-means.

841
01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:43.939
Clayton Graves: because you don't have to come up with a specific number of clusters. Well, and and I'll I'll I'll give you the the best answer I can for that right. Remember that whole interpretability thing we talked about

842
01:21:44.150 --> 01:21:52.430
Anthony Taylor: right? Because it's gonna make hierarchical clustering and the way it does it. It may not be as obvious as Amy.

843
01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:57.770
Anthony Taylor: Results doesn't mean it won't be. It depends on how your analysis go.

844
01:21:57.870 --> 01:22:00.710
Anthony Taylor: But but the whole thing is is K-means is

845
01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:04.719
Anthony Taylor: K-means is by far the most popular.

846
01:22:05.630 --> 01:22:06.590
Anthony Taylor: But

847
01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:14.390
Anthony Taylor: I say that, and you see other ones come up and down all the time in popularity. So to be honest, Playton.

848
01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:19.640
Anthony Taylor: If Birch, if you run birch, and when I show it to you you'll see it's really simple to run

849
01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:24.029
Anthony Taylor: run it. If it's better if it gives you better results. Use them.

850
01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:29.309
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And I'm even gonna show you a way to measure the results against all 3.

851
01:22:30.710 --> 01:22:34.559
Anthony Taylor: And even with the score saying

852
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:44.899
Anthony Taylor: that technically, this one is doing a better job of clustering. It still may not be the best one. You still may have to go. I'm going to go check and try this other.

853
01:22:45.150 --> 01:22:57.200
Anthony Taylor: This is the the hardest thing to get across to people about data. Science is. it's data. Science might not even be the right book. It's almost data art.

854
01:22:57.910 --> 01:23:01.229
Anthony Taylor: right? Because it really comes down to

855
01:23:01.390 --> 01:23:12.110
Anthony Taylor: you gotta just fiddle with stuff. You gotta play with the numbers. You gotta try this. It's it's so iterative that you know. And maybe that's what science part comes in

856
01:23:12.170 --> 01:23:15.479
Anthony Taylor: right? It's because you just gotta keep repeating yourself

857
01:23:15.550 --> 01:23:28.099
Anthony Taylor: again and again trying different things, trying different values. That's why. And you haven't seen it yet. But you will stuff like auto, ML. And all of these automated capabilities are becoming

858
01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:30.150
increasingly popular

859
01:23:30.170 --> 01:23:34.920
Anthony Taylor: because they can do thousands of iterations.

860
01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:38.999
Anthony Taylor: different models, different settings, all in one pass.

861
01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:45.599
Anthony Taylor: You could just say, Go. do it. walk away, go, have a beer.

862
01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:50.499
Anthony Taylor: I have a barbecue smoke, Brisket.

863
01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:52.430
Anthony Taylor: Come back.

864
01:23:52.850 --> 01:23:55.450
Clayton Graves: My challenge is

865
01:23:56.940 --> 01:24:00.860
Clayton Graves: working with the results and understanding the results and

866
01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:04.240
Clayton Graves: putting the results sort of useful

867
01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:06.000
Clayton Graves: synthesis

868
01:24:08.690 --> 01:24:13.249
Anthony Taylor: that I understand. And partially. we haven't done much with that yet.

869
01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:17.629
Anthony Taylor: So it's normal right now for you to say that.

870
01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:22.860
Anthony Taylor: But we're gonna get there. As you start seeing the results, we'll start. We'll start

871
01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:26.439
Anthony Taylor: explaining them best that we can.

872
01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:27.460
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

873
01:24:27.570 --> 01:24:38.349
Anthony Taylor: as we go through it and and and challenge Clayton. Everybody challenge us as a class when we get to results, you know. Well, what does that mean?

874
01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:41.370
Anthony Taylor: Okay, let's look at it. Let's figure out what that means.

875
01:24:41.850 --> 01:24:43.400
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Okay.

876
01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:48.679
Anthony Taylor:  we looked at Birch. We looked at Glumdal.

877
01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:54.469
Anthony Taylor: So bottom line often try multiple algorithms to find out which one appears to work best.

878
01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:57.519
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're gonna try out all 3

879
01:24:59.170 --> 01:25:02.509
Anthony Taylor: on a single dataset. It'll be very exciting.

880
01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:07.380
Anthony Taylor: and that's it. And then you're gonna do an activity week. So

881
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:14.549
here we go.

882
01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:28.550
Anthony Taylor: Okay. alright. So we're just gonna grab some grab a data set. We're gonna make moons. Member, make moons

883
01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:32.150
Anthony Taylor: made like the data look like that.

884
01:25:34.260 --> 01:25:37.659
Anthony Taylor:  you'll see. We'll we'll chart it out

885
01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:51.770
Anthony Taylor: alright. We're gonna well, okay. So we're gonna bring in pay means agglomerative clustering and birch. So what is the how do we do machine learning? What are the 3 things we always do?

886
01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:53.719
Baro, Sonja: I don't favor. I don't

887
01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:55.350
Anthony Taylor: thank you very much.

888
01:25:55.570 --> 01:25:59.000
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So these are the models. Part one

889
01:25:59.650 --> 01:26:05.430
Anthony Taylor: K-means 3, auto random state 0 fit. Predict, we're done.

890
01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:07.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

891
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:12.570
Anthony Taylor: pay means is done right? That's all we have to do.

892
01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:17.619
Anthony Taylor: Okay, let's do birch. Get ready for it. Are you ready.

893
01:26:18.650 --> 01:26:22.920
Anthony Taylor: birch model fit? Predict. Guess what we're done

894
01:26:25.450 --> 01:26:29.710
Anthony Taylor: just like that. That agglomerative

895
01:26:32.290 --> 01:26:34.850
Anthony Taylor: model fit. Predict.

896
01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:41.070
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this is just them messing with you. This is exactly the same as these 2 steps.

897
01:26:41.210 --> 01:26:43.229
Anthony Taylor: but we just combined it into what

898
01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:45.459
Anthony Taylor: got it.

899
01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:51.970
Anthony Taylor: We've now run all 3 models and trained them with different algorithms.

900
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:56.690
Anthony Taylor: Look at that code, guys, does it get easier than that?

901
01:26:57.510 --> 01:27:02.080
Anthony Taylor: Could you create a function from this 100%. Yes.

902
01:27:03.310 --> 01:27:04.790
Anthony Taylor: you just pass in them all

903
01:27:06.460 --> 01:27:12.990
Anthony Taylor: model and data frame. That's it. Okay, alright. So now let's look at the predictions.

904
01:27:13.010 --> 01:27:15.749
Anthony Taylor: So here we have

905
01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:22.899
Anthony Taylor: birch labels. We're creating a column called birch Labels, and we're going to put birch predictions in it and take a look.

906
01:27:23.870 --> 01:27:24.910
Anthony Taylor: Well, there they are.

907
01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:29.320
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

908
01:27:30.990 --> 01:27:40.900
Anthony Taylor: Now, here, we're going to rename the values from 0 and one to yes and no. Okay, that's exciting.

909
01:27:42.670 --> 01:27:49.849
Anthony Taylor: Wait, what feature? 0 is one feature. What? Wait. What do we do? Oh, sorry we changed the column names. My bad.

910
01:27:50.710 --> 01:27:51.720
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

911
01:27:52.990 --> 01:27:56.610
Anthony Taylor: Now we're gonna do a nice lot.

912
01:27:56.910 --> 01:27:58.369
Anthony Taylor: and we can see

913
01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:05.230
Anthony Taylor: pretty much. There's the split. So you guys remember the moons now.

914
01:28:05.690 --> 01:28:08.130
Anthony Taylor: when you see this like, Oh, yeah, the moves

915
01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:12.629
Anthony Taylor: alright. So it did it. So there's purchase

916
01:28:13.170 --> 01:28:13.990
Anthony Taylor: split.

917
01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:21.599
Anthony Taylor:  now we can. So this was, how many clusters was this?

918
01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:23.790
Anthony Taylor: 3. Right?

919
01:28:24.870 --> 01:28:25.950
Anthony Taylor: Not 2.

920
01:28:26.090 --> 01:28:28.759
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So we have 2 there.

921
01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:32.059
Anthony Taylor: says, estimate the scores. Okay.

922
01:28:33.170 --> 01:28:39.330
Anthony Taylor: So we got estimates, scores for 2 clusters. So we're gonna have. Yes, Sunny.

923
01:28:40.330 --> 01:28:46.150
Baro, Sonja: sorry. I just wanna confirm on the the visual, the burge. The moons.

924
01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:49.390
Baro, Sonja: Isn't that telling us there's 2 clusters.

925
01:28:49.710 --> 01:28:50.800
Anthony Taylor: Yes, ma'am.

926
01:28:51.650 --> 01:28:52.620
Baro, Sonja: Okay.

927
01:28:53.110 --> 01:28:54.680
Baro, Sonja: perfect. Thank you.

928
01:28:55.050 --> 01:28:56.110
Anthony Taylor: Not a problem.

929
01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:59.909
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So here we're gonna run it again.

930
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:18.390
Anthony Taylor: And run it out to here. I'm not sure why they're having us run it again. But we just will. Oh, and then we're gonna do it for 3. I guess we're just resetting everything. Okay? And now we're going to talk about. So this is how we sport. So we can't use the elbow curve. There is no inertia shop

931
01:29:19.290 --> 01:29:21.559
Anthony Taylor: with birch or agglomerative cluster.

932
01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:26.270
Anthony Taylor: So because we don't have inertia. we can't

933
01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:41.810
Anthony Taylor: look at that to see and to be honest with you. Inertia just tells us how many clusters we should use. It doesn't really tell us how well the model worked. So there is a measure that scores a cluster model.

934
01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:49.450
Anthony Taylor: Alright, and it's called the Kalinsky. How about score

935
01:29:52.710 --> 01:29:53.780
Anthony Taylor: that work?

936
01:29:55.770 --> 01:29:56.860
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

937
01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:00.770
Anthony Taylor:  this value

938
01:30:00.820 --> 01:30:02.000
Anthony Taylor: will.

939
01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:06.850
Anthony Taylor: Basically, it just looks at the clusters. And it goes.

940
01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:13.040
Anthony Taylor: This is, these are grouped nicely. pretty much

941
01:30:13.810 --> 01:30:16.800
Anthony Taylor: alright, the higher the value

942
01:30:17.210 --> 01:30:18.110
Anthony Taylor: the better.

943
01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:20.619
Anthony Taylor: So there's a problem with that

944
01:30:20.710 --> 01:30:22.610
Anthony Taylor: is 5, 88 high.

945
01:30:23.890 --> 01:30:24.969
Anthony Taylor: I don't know

946
01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:27.460
Anthony Taylor: if it's

947
01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:29.569
Anthony Taylor: if it's you know

948
01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:33.020
Anthony Taylor: how much dinner cost. That's high.

949
01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:37.900
Anthony Taylor: right? If it's the price of a new Mercedes

950
01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:39.760
Anthony Taylor: that's really low.

951
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:45.189
Anthony Taylor: So we don't know. We have no idea. So what do we do? Well, we need to

952
01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:50.209
Anthony Taylor: to compare. So we're going to do a birch with 2.

953
01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:56.440
Anthony Taylor: Right? So this one was birch with 2 clusters. This one will do birch with 3, and we'll run it again.

954
01:30:56.570 --> 01:31:03.810
Anthony Taylor: and we can see 6, 54. So now we have so something to compare to. So this tells us that

955
01:31:03.970 --> 01:31:07.710
Anthony Taylor: 3 clusters is probably better than 2

956
01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:11.190
Anthony Taylor: for this particular train.

957
01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:14.030
Anthony Taylor: Make sense.

958
01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:21.420
Baro, Sonja: Anthony, why you keep going.

959
01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:33.430
Baro, Sonja: Would you do run it again with 4 to keep getting absolutely absolutely. You could do that. That's again part of data science. Just try.

960
01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:35.509
Baro, Sonja: We don't know the ceiling, though.

961
01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:38.939
Anthony Taylor: Well, you will, because when you get 4 it's probably gonna go down.

962
01:31:40.830 --> 01:31:44.859
Dipinto, Matt: Can you remember me for a second and try something?

963
01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:53.919
Dipinto, Matt: What if you ask it to make 500 clusters. So it's a I just googled it. I know this is stupid.

964
01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:58.009
Dipinto, Matt: but I think it's I think the answer becomes infinity.

965
01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:03.620
Dipinto, Matt: It's the ratio of like into out of cluster, and this might take forever to cluster, because there's so many. There we go, there we go.

966
01:32:03.860 --> 01:32:05.940
Anthony Taylor: I just ran it. I just did it.

967
01:32:06.260 --> 01:32:07.560
Anthony Taylor: Let's see what it did.

968
01:32:07.630 --> 01:32:09.689
Baro, Sonja: So I'm excited to see what happens.

969
01:32:10.590 --> 01:32:11.840
Anthony Taylor: So scared.

970
01:32:12.490 --> 01:32:15.519
Baro, Sonja: 6, 54. It's still better. That doesn't make sense.

971
01:32:15.770 --> 01:32:18.060
Anthony Taylor: Let's let's see, did I run the right way?

972
01:32:19.470 --> 01:32:21.880
Anthony Taylor: Which one did I do?

973
01:32:22.290 --> 01:32:26.189
Anthony Taylor: Oh, that was the agglomerative. I probably just really messed that up.

974
01:32:26.370 --> 01:32:30.150
Anthony Taylor:  Hold on, we'll go down to the bottom.

975
01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:31.660
Anthony Taylor: I went. I went too far up.

976
01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:36.760
Baro, Sonja: Cause didn't you say there was one that would tell you the best.

977
01:32:38.350 --> 01:32:39.690
Baro, Sonja: Not for this.

978
01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:43.580
Baro, Sonja: Okay, that was Pca, right?

979
01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:51.760
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so look, there you go. Most it would do is 5. Yeah. Pca, something different. We'll get to that tomorrow.

980
01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:55.579
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So the most you could do on this one is 5.

981
01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:59.659
Anthony Taylor: So we could drop it to 5.

982
01:33:00.850 --> 01:33:06.130
Anthony Taylor: It did do that. Let's see what the new score is so in this case, 5 would've been good.

983
01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:11.890
Raugewitz, Tania: Can you kind of you force that answer by

984
01:33:12.450 --> 01:33:15.250
Raugewitz, Tania: telling it an ungodly hide number like 500.

985
01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:20.019
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I mean, I'm sure if we went, looked at the documentation for this.

986
01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:25.769
Anthony Taylor: it would have told us that 5 was either. It would tell us that 5 is most.

987
01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:27.990
Anthony Taylor: or it would tell us.

988
01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:33.189
Anthony Taylor: let's see. the default is 3.

989
01:33:35.550 --> 01:33:43.529
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I don't know if there is a Max. Maybe in this case the most it could come up with was 5. So it said, This is the best I could give you is 5, captain.

990
01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:49.000
Anthony Taylor: but based on that score. That's also the best.

991
01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:52.299
Anthony Taylor: Well, in this case. Yeah, absolutely.

992
01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:55.339
Dipinto, Matt: So. I think this will not always be the case. I promise

993
01:33:55.450 --> 01:33:59.739
Dipinto, Matt: there's kind of argument to be made against that, though it might be numerically the best.

994
01:33:59.860 --> 01:34:19.599
Dipinto, Matt: But if you look at these 2 moons depending on what you think of as a cluster. There's 2 clusters in there, right like there's 2 groups, and there's space between them. And so as we force it to make more clusters, the average distance between points in the cluster and the opposite cluster gets better and better and better, because, you know, we're kind of narrowing out that gap in the middle.

995
01:34:19.850 --> 01:34:23.379
Dipinto, Matt: But is it necessarily a better cluster

996
01:34:23.690 --> 01:34:31.670
Dipinto, Matt: to, you know, visual or intuition, or non mathematical approaches? And I don't think that more clusters is also better.

997
01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:39.799
Clayton Graves: and this goes back to the after step. Is that just something you would learn to eyeball then, because

998
01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:47.629
Anthony Taylor: you wouldn't eyeball anything. What you would do is you would when you. So what you would do is you'd run the model. You would probably go

999
01:34:47.850 --> 01:34:49.699
Anthony Taylor: 5 scored the highest.

1000
01:34:50.250 --> 01:34:53.989
Anthony Taylor: Okay, let's go. We do our analysis with 5 plus.

1001
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:59.139
Anthony Taylor: And then, as you dig like, we talked about earlier, you might be like, Oh, you know what

1002
01:34:59.230 --> 01:35:02.150
Anthony Taylor: these 2 clusters are too similar. Let's combine them.

1003
01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:07.900
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then these 2 clusters are too simple. So let's drop it down to 3 or down to 4.

1004
01:35:08.050 --> 01:35:17.660
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's the the analysis step is. Yeah, you just can't do clustering without the analysis. Step it just it just can't be done. Practically

1005
01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:21.799
Anthony Taylor: you could do it. But it isn't gonna mean anything to anybody. Yeah, Mike.

1006
01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:27.020
michael mcpherson: the image is the same. It just adds in 3 5 colors.

1007
01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:33.040
Anthony Taylor: Well, yeah, because the moons never change. But the color shows you how it clustered the data.

1008
01:35:35.170 --> 01:35:36.409
Anthony Taylor: Does that make sense?

1009
01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:45.610
Anthony Taylor: So yeah, so if we change this one. the birch one to 5, this one

1010
01:35:46.630 --> 01:35:54.919
Anthony Taylor: we can make. I'll show you what Mike's talking. So he ran this guy and this guy

1011
01:35:55.770 --> 01:35:58.800
Anthony Taylor: and this guy

1012
01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:04.979
Anthony Taylor: and this guy. and so now you can barely tell. But there's actually 5 columns there.

1013
01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:10.390
Clayton Graves: Why, why does that look better or worse than 2 clusters?

1014
01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:17.400
Anthony Taylor: It it it doesn't, I mean. But if you go back to to Matt's Point. You know we we have.

1015
01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:26.189
Anthony Taylor: We have the point. Well, okay, let's talk about. Remember what that score does that sabinsky that that crazy score.

1016
01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:37.329
Anthony Taylor:  that's like the name of it. But anyway, you know the score, grandma, the Kalinsky harmonize score. Okay, what it determines is how tightly

1017
01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:39.410
Anthony Taylor: fit the clusters are

1018
01:36:40.290 --> 01:36:46.809
Anthony Taylor: so more clusters in this data right here. It would make sense that it would see this

1019
01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:50.540
Anthony Taylor: and this and this.

1020
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:59.280
Anthony Taylor: and the only one that doesn't look tightly fit. Is this one? And and maybe this one. Okay, but the other ones are all pretty tight.

1021
01:36:59.870 --> 01:37:12.459
Anthony Taylor: though it scored it higher done. But to Matt's point, does that mean it's right? We don't know. That's why you have to get the analyst in here now and go. Yeah, I need you to go. Look at each groups and see if they make sense.

1022
01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:15.909
Anthony Taylor: because they may not. They may not make. I mean, they may be

1023
01:37:16.410 --> 01:37:18.580
Anthony Taylor: too similar or

1024
01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:25.099
Anthony Taylor: too different. Right? I mean, it just depends on on how the data pans out. And and again.

1025
01:37:25.420 --> 01:37:29.190
Anthony Taylor: do this. A lot. Guys, this happens at work a lot.

1026
01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:36.139
Anthony Taylor: You will get data. Someone will say, we need to label this data. You do it with clustering.

1027
01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:41.609
Anthony Taylor: You cluster it, you analyze it, you label it based on how it clustered.

1028
01:37:42.420 --> 01:37:44.160
Anthony Taylor: Now, your data is labeled.

1029
01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:50.069
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and then from there we flip over to classification, which we'll do next.

1030
01:37:51.690 --> 01:37:54.130
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so

1031
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:58.230
Anthony Taylor: it. This? This? Is it. But to answer, you guys this question.

1032
01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:01.760
Anthony Taylor: if there is no direct

1033
01:38:02.260 --> 01:38:06.399
Anthony Taylor: answer for how many clusters are right until you start looking at the data.

1034
01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:13.540
Clayton Graves: and since you look at it quantitatively, but it ain't gonna make any difference. And and since there is no real answer to that.

1035
01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:23.369
Clayton Graves: it, it brings you back to the score, and and the score being your main indicator. and if that's the case, then

1036
01:38:23.980 --> 01:38:33.040
Clayton Graves: 5 clusters is the best, and then you would give it to a data analyst, and they would say, Well, that's not the best, or that is the best right, they would say, you know what

1037
01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:40.519
Anthony Taylor: I see why I did 5, but these 2 are the same. So slip, drop it to 4, or these 3 groups are the same. Drop it to 3.

1038
01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:42.200
Anthony Taylor: But

1039
01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:53.480
Anthony Taylor: it's kind of weird that they did it with this data. If this was normally distributed data. right? Just scatter plot of data across the screen. This would probably make more sense.

1040
01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:56.670
Anthony Taylor: Okay, because this is the moon data. It's kind of weird.

1041
01:38:57.320 --> 01:38:59.299
Anthony Taylor: But yeah.

1042
01:38:59.330 --> 01:39:01.859
Anthony Taylor: so and you know what, I'm bet you

1043
01:39:04.710 --> 01:39:06.570
Anthony Taylor: that you're gonna get to find that out.

1044
01:39:08.540 --> 01:39:12.150
Anthony Taylor: Yup. yeah. So you guys are gonna fit.

1045
01:39:13.530 --> 01:39:17.209
Anthony Taylor: You guys are gonna do birch and stuff on the data we've been using all day.

1046
01:39:17.630 --> 01:39:19.489
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's what you're gonna do.

1047
01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:24.369
Anthony Taylor: or the rest of class pretty much hold on. Is that it? Really.

1048
01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:28.819
Anthony Taylor: I think it is.

1049
01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:38.620
Anthony Taylor: Yep, okay. So for 25 min. you guys are going to do this last one. This is kind of bringing it all together.

1050
01:39:39.850 --> 01:39:47.860
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you're gonna preprocess. You're gonna do a K-means. You're gonna do an elbow. You're gonna do

1051
01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:52.430
Anthony Taylor: everything. Just remember that

1052
01:39:53.150 --> 01:39:59.500
Anthony Taylor:  copy for the cadmium stuff. Just go grab it for one of your other activities.

1053
01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:11.530
Anthony Taylor: Most of it is exactly the same. Alright, don't! Don't kill yourself coding out all of that stuff if it doesn't give it to you alright. Got it awesome.

1054
01:40:20.770 --> 01:40:23.080
Anthony Taylor: So how do we do with that? One?

1055
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:26.630
michael mcpherson: Horrible is good.

1056
01:40:26.750 --> 01:40:30.440
Anthony Taylor: horrible! Mike! Natalie was. Thumbs up, man.

1057
01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:33.749
Anthony Taylor: anybody else struggle with that one

1058
01:40:35.620 --> 01:40:36.650
Anthony Taylor: little bit

1059
01:40:37.260 --> 01:40:38.760
Anthony Taylor: little bit spit

1060
01:40:39.110 --> 01:40:43.539
Anthony Taylor: little bit alright. Well, let's go through it. See what we got

1061
01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:52.370
Anthony Taylor: alright. So we're gonna import our stuff same stuff as always and import our data. Gotta get that

1062
01:40:52.860 --> 01:41:00.560
Anthony Taylor: we can see right away we've got this is that limit balance. Fill them out, pay them out. So they already kind of know what to do with this one?

1063
01:41:01.460 --> 01:41:04.279
Anthony Taylor: Actually, I'm gonna check. Make sure I'm in the right activity. Yep.

1064
01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:09.509
Anthony Taylor: so we got we take a look same as earlier.

1065
01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:14.230
Anthony Taylor: Okay, is this literally the same exercise we did earlier?

1066
01:41:14.460 --> 01:41:19.359
michael mcpherson: Am I on the right one? Yes. Is this the right one? But the names have all changed.

1067
01:41:22.050 --> 01:41:24.630
Masarirambi, Rodney: It's the same. but different.

1068
01:41:26.450 --> 01:41:31.730
Anthony Taylor: You're making me think of that bon Jovi song. It's all the same.

1069
01:41:32.850 --> 01:41:35.809
Anthony Taylor: only the names are changed.

1070
01:41:36.670 --> 01:41:40.550
Anthony Taylor: Okay? I thought we said, singing.

1071
01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:41.850
Anthony Taylor: bye.

1072
01:41:43.730 --> 01:41:56.499
Anthony Taylor: I personally learn better if you sing it to me. So you don't want me singing. Only thing you'll remember is how much your header set.

1073
01:41:56.900 --> 01:42:03.109
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we're gonna get done. Eastern education, which we did do earlier. I remember very clearly on this week

1074
01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:10.120
Anthony Taylor: A, then we're gonna take a look at it and add it back to our table. Yay.

1075
01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:13.970
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna encode marriage. Did they give you this at least?

1076
01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:18.640
Anthony Taylor: How did they make you go copy paste? Okay, good.

1077
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:27.009
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Here we go. Let's get some. Oh, no. We did this earlier, too. We scaled it, and then we added it back to the data frame.

1078
01:42:28.010 --> 01:42:34.540
Anthony Taylor: Everybody with me. So far. any questions, doubts. concerns

1079
01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:47.360
Anthony Taylor: trying to drag this out for 18 min. Okay. part 3 elbows. So we're gonna do what we've done like every time today

1080
01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:50.490
Anthony Taylor: that this you could copy right from

1081
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:52.200
Anthony Taylor: to other activity.

1082
01:42:54.210 --> 01:42:57.880
Anthony Taylor: gonna create our list. loop through.

1083
01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:00.680
Anthony Taylor: create the the elbow data

1084
01:43:01.370 --> 01:43:02.540
Anthony Taylor: lot it

1085
01:43:03.950 --> 01:43:06.650
Anthony Taylor: 3 or 4, probably.

1086
01:43:07.550 --> 01:43:09.810
Anthony Taylor: Okay, try it with 3.

1087
01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:18.980
Anthony Taylor: Oh, okay. And before we do anything with it, we're gonna do an agglomerative. Why not?

1088
01:43:20.660 --> 01:43:22.250
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna do a perch.

1089
01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:27.919
Raugewitz, Tania: Alright. Can you kind of slow down for this slowdown right here? What would you like me to go.

1090
01:43:28.610 --> 01:43:30.290
Raugewitz, Tania: Okay? So

1091
01:43:32.010 --> 01:43:33.400
Raugewitz, Tania: we

1092
01:43:34.010 --> 01:43:42.750
Raugewitz, Tania: we're getting a bit of an error. So you did. The agglomer equals agglomerative clustering and clusters. 3.

1093
01:43:44.270 --> 01:43:48.499
Anthony Taylor: Remember, you could do fit and predict but fit. Predict.

1094
01:43:48.610 --> 01:43:54.080
Raugewitz, Tania: I, I didn't take the X out. I was using my copy paste.

1095
01:43:55.030 --> 01:44:00.230
Raugewitz, Tania: Okay, the previous.

1096
01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:14.899
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Excellent. Yeah. So another reason I kinda and I will slow down. But just so, you guys know the only reason I kind of went faster, because again, it's model fit. Predict. I mean, it's the same thing. The only thing we're changing

1097
01:44:15.230 --> 01:44:16.310
Anthony Taylor: name of them up.

1098
01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:17.480
Raugewitz, Tania: And then.

1099
01:44:17.690 --> 01:44:25.040
Raugewitz, Tania: to show you did the negative, 10 rose that that was just to show. Yeah, some data. But yeah.

1100
01:44:25.710 --> 01:44:28.800
Raugewitz, Tania: how did it? An example of how you can show data?

1101
01:44:29.410 --> 01:44:32.329
Anthony Taylor: Oh, well, right? So, yeah, I mean, you coulda just went

1102
01:44:34.190 --> 01:44:35.830
Anthony Taylor: and just showed all of it

1103
01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:39.599
Anthony Taylor: right. But we sliced it down and said, let's show like

1104
01:44:39.610 --> 01:44:41.979
Raugewitz, Tania: the last 10. Yeah.

1105
01:44:42.820 --> 01:44:47.419
Raugewitz, Tania: Yeah. So we just said, by doing negative 10. We said, Show us the last 10.

1106
01:44:51.310 --> 01:44:52.120
Raugewitz, Tania: Alright.

1107
01:44:52.770 --> 01:44:53.730
Anthony Taylor: Coolio.

1108
01:44:53.950 --> 01:45:01.630
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, that's true that they did. They actually tell you guys 10? Or is that just what they did. That's just what they did. Okay, alright.

1109
01:45:01.670 --> 01:45:08.800
Anthony Taylor: So let's go through birch, nice and slow birch. We select our model in clusters 3. We fit it with our data frame.

1110
01:45:10.410 --> 01:45:16.259
Anthony Taylor: Then we do our predict into a variable again. This time we're going to show the last 10 in.

1111
01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:24.670
Anthony Taylor: So there you go. We can see right away, they're slightly different. I wouldn't even say slightly different. Let's say they're a lot different.

1112
01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:27.250
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1113
01:45:28.190 --> 01:45:37.740
Anthony Taylor:  And then, now, we're gonna copy our data frame. We're going to create. We're going to take basically our predictions from each

1114
01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:41.009
Anthony Taylor: and put them in a different column.

1115
01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:45.599
Anthony Taylor: And then we're gonna take a quick look@themusing.ed.

1116
01:45:45.970 --> 01:45:54.080
Anthony Taylor: Oh, what did I miss? It? Did click on something wrong. You accidentally did some copying and paste. I sure did, didn't II sure did.

1117
01:45:54.420 --> 01:45:55.459
Anthony Taylor: Here we go

1118
01:45:56.770 --> 01:46:04.530
Anthony Taylor: alright. So now we can see we kind of take a look collaborative. So you can see the interesting thing. Well, none of them are the same

1119
01:46:05.870 --> 01:46:10.979
Anthony Taylor: as I say, look like we're going to be similar. But they're not

1120
01:46:12.490 --> 01:46:13.809
Anthony Taylor: okay. Now.

1121
01:46:15.060 --> 01:46:16.300
Anthony Taylor: Pop, Quiz.

1122
01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:19.760
Anthony Taylor: does it matter?

1123
01:46:21.250 --> 01:46:25.550
Anthony Taylor: Does. it matters that this is 0.

1124
01:46:25.710 --> 01:46:31.639
Anthony Taylor: This is 0, and this is one or even that. This is 2. This is 0. This is what

1125
01:46:32.490 --> 01:46:33.590
Anthony Taylor: does it matter.

1126
01:46:35.330 --> 01:46:36.889
Anthony Taylor: Derek, why doesn't it matter?

1127
01:46:39.790 --> 01:46:43.289
Derek Rikke: Are we just guessing, I think, cause the numbers

1128
01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:47.109
Derek Rikke: only relate to the model like they don't

1129
01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:52.630
Anthony Taylor: related to each other. It's just clusters. Since they're not labels.

1130
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:57.690
Anthony Taylor: Right? They're just that's just how we identified a cluster of data.

1131
01:46:57.960 --> 01:47:08.040
Anthony Taylor: the cluster, how they got started, how they became 0 one and 2. We don't know. They they do it totally differently, each one.

1132
01:47:08.190 --> 01:47:15.149
Anthony Taylor: So there's no no, nothing that says that cluster 0. Here is the same cluster as 0 here.

1133
01:47:16.210 --> 01:47:18.430
Anthony Taylor: This could actually be closer to one.

1134
01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:23.019
Anthony Taylor: Or maybe you know, this 0 is cluster 2.

1135
01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:24.410
Anthony Taylor: We don't know.

1136
01:47:24.850 --> 01:47:32.659
Anthony Taylor: Okay, all we know is that it created 3 clusters, and this row was identified as Cluster 0,

1137
01:47:32.850 --> 01:47:35.509
Anthony Taylor: the cluster 0 may not be the same in both

1138
01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:36.880
algorithms.

1139
01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:38.980
Anthony Taylor: Okay, good.

1140
01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:40.269
Anthony Taylor: good, good. Good.

1141
01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:43.589
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So then, we're yeah, Ronnie.

1142
01:47:44.890 --> 01:47:45.810
Masarirambi, Rodney: So

1143
01:47:47.730 --> 01:47:50.120
Masarirambi, Rodney: is there a time when we would.

1144
01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:55.600
Masarirambi, Rodney: you know, call this out like in a report like where we use the different

1145
01:47:55.700 --> 01:47:58.890
plus where we say that the differences between.

1146
01:47:59.740 --> 01:48:06.850
Masarirambi, Rodney: like the different outputs between K-means, I'll go, and virt or no or no.

1147
01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:16.669
Anthony Taylor: Well, the the the question is, is, are there different? So let's hold that, Mike. Hold on 1 s. Let me let me let me run these 3 plots real quick.

1148
01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:26.170
Anthony Taylor: So visually. Okay. we can see. Here's the K-means clusters. Okay.

1149
01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:35.200
Anthony Taylor: there's the same graph. But the agglomerative cluster. Now we can see a difference. Right? You see the difference.

1150
01:48:35.390 --> 01:48:39.130
Masarirambi, Rodney: I certainly can, right? And then here's the birch clusters.

1151
01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:44.840
Anthony Taylor: Birch is actually most similar to canyes in the graph.

1152
01:48:46.020 --> 01:48:51.009
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So with that being said just because

1153
01:48:51.470 --> 01:48:55.270
Anthony Taylor: they like. So here's a great example. This data

1154
01:48:55.750 --> 01:48:59.870
Anthony Taylor: is one. this cluster here.

1155
01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:03.299
Anthony Taylor: this cluster's 0, this cluster's 2.

1156
01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:08.090
Anthony Taylor: You see that by the color scale here. But up here

1157
01:49:09.090 --> 01:49:15.169
Anthony Taylor: this bottom cluster is 0. The screen clusters 2, and this top one's one

1158
01:49:16.830 --> 01:49:21.200
Anthony Taylor: now. But we can agree that this 0

1159
01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:25.269
Anthony Taylor: is the same as this one. Can we agree with that

1160
01:49:26.620 --> 01:49:34.220
Anthony Taylor: right? So that goes back to what Derek was saying. The clustered numbers don't necessarily equate to their position

1161
01:49:35.950 --> 01:49:44.779
Anthony Taylor: alright because of the thing. So what would you have to do? We're back to the same thing. We gotta go. Do announce. Now this visual gives us a nice mapping.

1162
01:49:45.130 --> 01:49:50.059
Anthony Taylor: right? We can tell. Like in all of them, the green is pretty much the same.

1163
01:49:51.940 --> 01:49:57.640
Anthony Taylor: I mean, they're slightly different groupings, but they're in the center. But the 2 blues switch places.

1164
01:49:59.050 --> 01:50:01.000
Anthony Taylor: So yeah, yes, Mike.

1165
01:50:01.300 --> 01:50:02.760
Anthony Taylor: thank you for being patient.

1166
01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:06.340
michael mcpherson: My,

1167
01:50:06.810 --> 01:50:11.930
michael mcpherson: marriage encoding keeps coming back as an object, and it won't do anything.

1168
01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:15.650
michael mcpherson: Even after the

1169
01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:22.549
Anthony Taylor: II would assume that you're in code function. You put the return one in. Quotes

1170
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:24.000
michael mcpherson: no.

1171
01:50:25.490 --> 01:50:27.060
Anthony Taylor: and here you did not.

1172
01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:30.559
michael mcpherson: No? Well, then.

1173
01:50:30.860 --> 01:50:34.149
Anthony Taylor: look up how to convert a column into an integer.

1174
01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:37.540
michael mcpherson: Thank you.

1175
01:50:38.350 --> 01:50:44.019
michael mcpherson: That'll be that. That's their next solution. But it shouldn't have done that

1176
01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:46.160
michael mcpherson: code that you gave define?

1177
01:50:46.450 --> 01:50:48.699
Define, encode, marriage, marriage.

1178
01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:52.700
michael mcpherson: if marriage equals, yes, return, one else returns 0.

1179
01:50:52.890 --> 01:50:54.590
michael mcpherson: That should have converted

1180
01:50:55.350 --> 01:50:56.600
michael mcpherson: the object

1181
01:50:56.770 --> 01:51:02.739
michael mcpherson: to to an integer as long as you didn't have quotes around, you want to, you know. Let share with us shows real quick.

1182
01:51:03.170 --> 01:51:04.799
Anthony Taylor: I'm I'm suspicious.

1183
01:51:09.390 --> 01:51:12.090
michael mcpherson: See? Merge object

1184
01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:14.120
michael mcpherson: run.

1185
01:51:16.330 --> 01:51:21.949
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Well, you ran it more than once. So do me a favor. Go up.

1186
01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:25.610
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, yeah. Okay, I'll do that.

1187
01:51:34.660 --> 01:51:43.889
Anthony Taylor: Okay, thank you. And the truth. Value of a series is ambiguous. Use a.md. 8. Pool!

1188
01:51:45.130 --> 01:51:49.600
Anthony Taylor: What line is that? Return? Apply standard.

1189
01:51:50.430 --> 01:51:52.880
Anthony Taylor: Apply in co-marriage.

1190
01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:19.630
Dipinto, Matt:  and access for the month. This we're doing.

1191
01:52:21.270 --> 01:52:22.700
Anthony Taylor: Scroll up a little bit.

1192
01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:29.900
Anthony Taylor: and again

1193
01:52:31.830 --> 01:52:33.990
Anthony Taylor: marriage is right there.

1194
01:52:36.610 --> 01:52:38.030
Anthony Taylor: Scroll back down.

1195
01:52:40.270 --> 01:52:42.640
michael mcpherson: I even tried to do

1196
01:52:43.340 --> 01:52:48.250
michael mcpherson: do it by way of get dummies, and it came up with the same thing.

1197
01:52:49.170 --> 01:52:51.419
Anthony Taylor: But I mean you can't

1198
01:52:52.620 --> 01:52:56.060
Anthony Taylor: technically should have worked as well. But.

1199
01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:02.100
Anthony Taylor: huh!

1200
01:53:03.330 --> 01:53:08.070
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. Let's look at it in a bit. That's weird. It's gonna be something simple, I'm sure.

1201
01:53:08.540 --> 01:53:26.459
Anthony Taylor: but I don't see it right now. We won't hold everybody up on that alright. No, no, no good. That that's just strange. I don't get it actually, though, I think we're almost to the end, anyway. So here we go. So you guys can see all the charts show that each one was pretty close to the same

1202
01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:38.410
Anthony Taylor: slight difference in the one and 2, I think. But the 3 of the other top groups seems to be very similar in each one. So here we're going to create 3 lists.

1203
01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:43.749
Anthony Taylor:  and oh, look at this. Oh, this is bonus.

1204
01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:48.859
Anthony Taylor: We don't have to do this one, but it's kind of cool, so we'll run through

1205
01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:52.540
Anthony Taylor: alright. We're going to do the same loop that we've been doing all along.

1206
01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:59.969
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this looks really busy. I don't want you guys to worry too much about it, because it's really not doing too much more.

1207
01:54:01.150 --> 01:54:08.519
Anthony Taylor: It's going to run the K-means model. It's going to fit it. There is another property called labels.

1208
01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:12.979
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're gonna take those labels

1209
01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:16.840
Anthony Taylor: and use them

1210
01:54:16.900 --> 01:54:22.090
Anthony Taylor: to get our metrics. Remember, we did this earlier with the Kalinsky harvest score.

1211
01:54:22.610 --> 01:54:25.430
Anthony Taylor: Alright. We're Gonna take that score

1212
01:54:25.700 --> 01:54:27.080
Anthony Taylor: and append it

1213
01:54:28.090 --> 01:54:32.510
Anthony Taylor: to this list here. So there's our K-means score.

1214
01:54:33.290 --> 01:54:40.220
Anthony Taylor: Then we're gonna do the same thing. Ablative fit predict labels, score, append the score

1215
01:54:41.380 --> 01:54:42.350
Anthony Taylor: birch

1216
01:54:43.790 --> 01:54:44.610
Anthony Taylor: fit.

1217
01:54:44.740 --> 01:54:48.690
Anthony Taylor: predict or fit. Get the labels score.

1218
01:54:48.890 --> 01:54:50.280
Anthony Taylor: append the score

1219
01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:54.160
Anthony Taylor: alright that way. We end with

1220
01:54:54.490 --> 01:54:56.640
Anthony Taylor: 3 lists of

1221
01:54:58.080 --> 01:54:59.690
Anthony Taylor: looks like 9.

1222
01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:05.570
Anthony Taylor: Value. 9 runs for each of our moms.

1223
01:55:06.060 --> 01:55:09.350
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this takes like 6 s to run.

1224
01:55:11.070 --> 01:55:24.100
Anthony Taylor: Did anybody get to this? Or was this even in the activity? That's alright. This is extra. It does say bonus on my screen. all right. So now we can take a look. And C, and what we're looking for is the higher scores

1225
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:28.010
Anthony Taylor: with the right amount of clusters. So like, here's an 11,000.

1226
01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:32.930
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So it looks like K-means wins

1227
01:55:33.260 --> 01:55:36.210
Anthony Taylor: K-means at 2 3, 4,

1228
01:55:36.750 --> 01:55:39.449
Anthony Taylor: maybe 5. I'd say 4 or 5.

1229
01:55:41.290 --> 01:55:46.580
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so that's the point of that exercise is, you can compare 10 different runs

1230
01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:49.680
Anthony Taylor: with each other and and see

1231
01:55:49.870 --> 01:55:53.740
Anthony Taylor: but, by the way, on that which one was last birch.

1232
01:55:55.680 --> 01:56:00.920
Anthony Taylor: Here you can see how Birch started high and then went down

1233
01:56:02.090 --> 01:56:11.680
Anthony Taylor: as it got further away. So the best birch was actually right about there. So they don't always get better as they.

1234
01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:13.810
Anthony Taylor: But yeah.

1235
01:56:15.340 --> 01:56:18.010
Anthony Taylor: any questions on any of this stuff

1236
01:56:19.710 --> 01:56:23.920
Anthony Taylor: I did verify tomorrow is Pca.

1237
01:56:24.520 --> 01:56:31.480
Anthony Taylor:  yeah, that's it, too. We're gonna do Pca, Pca. And then a little bit of Pca.

1238
01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:36.160
Anthony Taylor: And then you're gonna have one big activity. And that's it.

1239
01:56:37.250 --> 01:56:38.430
Anthony Taylor: That's tomorrow.

1240
01:56:38.730 --> 01:56:47.730
Anthony Taylor: which is pretty much right unsupervised. It's not a lot of stuff to do, but this has been a great start. and then next week we start on superbowl.

1241
01:56:48.750 --> 01:56:50.650
Anthony Taylor: so we could probably

1242
01:56:50.900 --> 01:56:52.129
Raugewitz, Tania: work on our

1243
01:56:52.460 --> 01:56:58.730
Raugewitz, Tania: alright module unless it asked for Pca, yeah. Oh, no. Next week is regression. Thank you.

1244
01:56:59.210 --> 01:57:07.220
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Oh, you wanna work on it in class, just throwing it out there. You know. I'm just, you know, spitballing.

1245
01:57:07.290 --> 01:57:10.590
Anthony Taylor: I was here. I gotta be here, anyway. If you guys here, I gotta be here.

1246
01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:13.920
Anthony Taylor:  But again.

1247
01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:16.300
Anthony Taylor: yeah. So anyway.

1248
01:57:16.410 --> 01:57:26.340
Anthony Taylor: great job today I will see you tomorrow, and I don't have any resources because I already gave you pay resources, so there are no more resources for tomorrow.

1249
01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:30.710
Anthony Taylor: But so look at the Pca ones. If you haven't yet, you are good to go.

1250
01:57:31.630 --> 01:57:35.229
Anthony Taylor: Oh. stop one last thing.

1251
01:57:35.380 --> 01:57:44.930
Anthony Taylor: Open AI. I'd like to go in and do the first extra review with Openai next week, sometime, probably before class.

1252
01:57:45.180 --> 01:57:48.360
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if you can't make it, I'll record it. Don't worry.

1253
01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:58.970
Anthony Taylor:  but I need to. I mean you will need to get an Openai Api key to do it to, to, to code along.

1254
01:57:59.050 --> 01:58:08.970
Anthony Taylor: You don't have to have one to come or to watch it. But you have to have one code long. Okay, so keep that in mind if you're interested in doing alright.

1255
01:58:09.780 --> 01:58:14.219
Anthony Taylor: When when did you say what that was again? Let's do.

1256
01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:16.290
Anthony Taylor: Wednesday

1257
01:58:16.620 --> 01:58:18.160
Anthony Taylor: before class?

1258
01:58:18.570 --> 01:58:31.659
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I have it all done ready to go. But yeah, it's it's gonna be pretty simple. I want to keep these like 1520 min long.  you know. And then we're gonna on that one. We'll build up from that.

1259
01:58:32.270 --> 01:58:43.090
Anthony Taylor: We'll do Lane chain next, and we'll do some other things. We'll just keep building up some of this stuff, I think we're, you know, like I said, we don't have the full lesson plan yet.

1260
01:58:43.110 --> 01:58:54.079
Anthony Taylor: They're telling me that some of this stuff they're gonna cover in more depth later. I don't think they're gonna cover open AI, though, because it they it costs money. It can customize.

1261
01:58:54.260 --> 01:58:57.260
Anthony Taylor: and they don't like to give you guys anything that might cost money.

1262
01:58:57.630 --> 01:59:06.969
Anthony Taylor: So that's why I'm telling you do not have to attend. You do not have to have. But if you want to code along, you'll need it. It should not cost you

1263
01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:08.110
Anthony Taylor: anything.

1264
01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:14.229
Anthony Taylor: But unless you like, publish it to the Internet, and let thousands of people. Use your open AI key.

1265
01:59:14.780 --> 01:59:15.730
Anthony Taylor: That's bad

1266
01:59:16.570 --> 01:59:23.070
Anthony Taylor: hiking. So anyway, see you tomorrow we'll I'll remind you again all about the Wednesday thing.

1267
01:59:23.970 --> 01:59:25.380
Anthony Taylor: Have a good night.

1268
01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:31.540
Anthony Taylor: Hi, Miss.
