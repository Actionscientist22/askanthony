1
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.860
Anthony Taylor: Welcome everybody. Okay.

2
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.369
Anthony Taylor: before we even get going.

3
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.579
Anthony Taylor: Holy cow. 4 modules. You starting the fourth module today.

4
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.919
Anthony Taylor: Hot dog. That is very, very good

5
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.859
Anthony Taylor:  basic python is done. How you guys doing with that?

6
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.269
Anthony Taylor: The challenge is challenging or no.

7
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:47.330
Anthony Taylor: I see lots of study groups super proud of you guys for that. Okay, I do. I'm still at the at the point where I'm really watching, like everything you guys type.

8
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.399
Anthony Taylor: but trying not to say anything.

9
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:57.660
Anthony Taylor: just letting you guys do what you do. And it's working wonderfully makes me very happy.

10
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.140
Anthony Taylor:  yeah. So not all else to say other than

11
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.420
Anthony Taylor: today's gonna be great. I don't expect today to last real long. Hold on! Are there still people not here?

12
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.410
Anthony Taylor: Come on, Dude.

13
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.580
Anthony Taylor: No.

14
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.200
Anthony Taylor: stand by. We all have to wait 10 s now.

15
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:29.750
Mcpherson, Michael: Arthur.

16
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.200
Anthony Taylor: I agree. Kevin.

17
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.490
Anthony Taylor: Hello, Miss Sanya! You missed the whole intro class because your ta session went over.

18
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:56.299
Baro, Sonja: Oh, I'm sorry I missed something very important, I'm sure. Did. I was probably talking about the weather or something. Yeah. Well, good thing. You record everything.

19
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.620
Anthony Taylor: Umhm. I didn't, because y'all weren't back yet.

20
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:11.929
Anthony Taylor: Oh, darn I do! It's okay, anyway. I know I know what it was. I was congratulating everybody or whatever

21
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.989
Anthony Taylor: good work everybody.

22
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.290
Anthony Taylor: Let's get started on Module 4. So before we get really too heavy into it myself.

23
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.389
Anthony Taylor:  I heard somebody coming.

24
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.330
Anthony Taylor: Oh, it's Tanya again.

25
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.900
My seat now

26
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.380
Anthony Taylor: before we get too heavy into it. Let's talk about the role data plays in

27
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.769
Anthony Taylor: what we're doing. So

28
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.940
Anthony Taylor: we're all here for AI bye.

29
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.680
Anthony Taylor:  tell me. You know what? Let's let's let's start this way. Somebody tell me

30
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.740
Anthony Taylor: what role you feel. Data plays in AI

31
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.120
Anthony Taylor: who wants to tell me. Go ahead, Meredith.

32
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.039
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Sorry I couldn't get the reactions button fast enough.

33
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:28.469
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I feel like it's like hugely central and can make or break it like you can't. I don't think you can create AI without data. And I think if the quality of your data is bad, then your AI that comes from it is gonna be not helpful.

34
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.319
Meredith McCanse (she/her): so II think of it as kind of part and parcel, and like very key ingredient.

35
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.179
Anthony Taylor: excellent, excellent, and a hundred percent true, Rodney, did you want to add to that?

36
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:49.210
Masarirambi, Rodney: Yeah? Well, actually, not. Well, yes, it basically the same thing that I was gonna say, but I think

37
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:57.399
Masarirambi, Rodney: I think it's even more covered than that. Without data, you can't have AI because you have to train the models

38
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.600
Masarirambi, Rodney: they like. So essentially without data, you. you got nothing.

39
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Good. And that

40
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:11.409
Anthony Taylor: is exactly what I was looking for. I wanted to make sure it was clear that AI does not exist without data.

41
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.999
Anthony Taylor: And by data we mean structured, unstructured images.

42
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:25.669
Anthony Taylor: Images are technically unstructured. Really, everything falls under, structured and unstructured. But to be a little more generic or less generic.

43
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.309
Anthony Taylor: You know. I mean, we're talking

44
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:45.490
Anthony Taylor: business data. We're talking web data, you know, web scraping like off of people's Internet sites, Wikipedia's manuals, images images that were drawn images that were, you know, photos that were taken. All of these things are being used to train modern day. AI,

45
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.340
Anthony Taylor: okay.

46
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.060
Anthony Taylor:  and they all have one thing in common.

47
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.710
Anthony Taylor: Ml. And AI.

48
00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.870
Anthony Taylor: Do not, cannot train on. Words

49
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.229
Anthony Taylor: cannot train on a picture

50
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:13.179
Anthony Taylor: and wait. Anthony, you just said we use it all to train these models. Accurate. Yes, but all of it has to be processed

51
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.910
Anthony Taylor: pre-processed and then processed again.

52
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:24.499
Anthony Taylor: It's just for the model to begin to understand what it is you want it to understand. So there is no

53
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.200
Anthony Taylor: words

54
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:40.599
Anthony Taylor: being passed in to an AI model. at least not at the point of where it's actually learning the words get passed in. At the beginning they get pre-processed and basically turned into numbers.

55
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.319
Anthony Taylor: Those numbers

56
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.300
Anthony Taylor: then get taught to

57
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.389
Anthony Taylor: the model, and then the model learns from those, and then learns to bring them back into words.

58
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.980
Anthony Taylor:  all of that being said

59
00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:03.640
Anthony Taylor: one of the most important things. So one of the most important things that we are going to learn is how to handle data.

60
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:18.449
Anthony Taylor: So this is where we definitely cross over. Remember, I told you guys at the beginning there will be stuff where we cross into the data side of things.  and

61
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:25.520
Anthony Taylor: that will help you like when you're looking for work later, you can actually say, Yeah, I've had training

62
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:30.630
Anthony Taylor: in this as well. So pandas is the

63
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.360
Anthony Taylor: absolute python library

64
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.420
Anthony Taylor: that we use to deal with data. It is not the only one.

65
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.799
Anthony Taylor: it is by far the most popular.

66
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.970
Anthony Taylor: It is not the most powerful by any means.

67
00:06:48.900 --> 00:07:01.630
Anthony Taylor: But it is the one that we will use throughout this course. I will probably show you guys some of the bigger ones the ones like I use. I don't use pandas every day. My data is far too big

68
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:02.770
Anthony Taylor: for pandas.

69
00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:10.720
Anthony Taylor: Pandas requires you to have data small enough to fit on your computer, which can still be many millions of rows.

70
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:20.929
Anthony Taylor: The data I deal with is in the billions or trillions. So it doesn't fit on a computer. So I have to use one called pi spark.

71
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.000
Anthony Taylor: But I will show it to you at some point.

72
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:37.700
Anthony Taylor: anyway. So let's talk about pandas. So pandas. Well, actually, this is today's objectives. We're gonna describe a data frame, we're gonna import data. So for the first time, you guys are gonna actually be able to grab data

73
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:45.240
Anthony Taylor: from another source and pull it into python and then manipulate it. Okay.

74
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:55.129
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna also create files from our data. So we'll be able to pull it in, be able to mess with it and then put it back out there.

75
00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:07.219
Anthony Taylor: Also gonna learn under you to create data frames which you don't know what they are yet. But with lists and dictionaries, and we're gonna learn to manipulate columns.

76
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.280
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so

77
00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:18.690
Anthony Taylor: think big is, is everyone used to spreadsheet? Does anyone not use the spreadsheet? Let's ask that question

78
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.380
Anthony Taylor: never gave. Give me a break.

79
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:30.670
Anthony Taylor: You're being funny, right? I can't see your mouth, so I don't know if you're giggling. You've never used a spreadsheet, really.

80
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:34.169
Anthony Taylor: but you've messed with data before.

81
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:40.710
Vasquez, Gabriel: Yeah, I've I mean, I've messed with it through a Apis. But I haven't had like.

82
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.789
Vasquez, Gabriel: like through a spreadsheet or anything like that.

83
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.469
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So you weren't teasing.

84
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:50.980
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Well, I mean, it's rows and columns. Okay, that's that's probably enough for right now.

85
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:56.730
Anthony Taylor: So you know. But spreadsheets are are how most laymen

86
00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.170
Anthony Taylor: work with data.

87
00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:01.090
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

88
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:15.190
Anthony Taylor:  that works. And if you have excel. If you already own excel, it's pretty good. It has a. It has limitations. It can't go on forever.

89
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:22.180
Anthony Taylor:  There are programmatic things that you would have to customize if you wanted it to do more.

90
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:28.899
Anthony Taylor: And it's just overall. It's just not great for manipulating large amounts of data.

91
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:33.840
Anthony Taylor: Google spreadsheets is basically the same thing as excel.

92
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:41.620
Anthony Taylor: They say it's not as advanced, that's true, but it's not. I mean, you can always programmatically affect these tools.

93
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:50.320
Anthony Taylor: But either way, I mean, it's still just a spreadsheet.  really, complex mathematics or

94
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:57.089
Anthony Taylor: or manipulation is painful in spreadsheets. They're very slow when you're dealing with large files.

95
00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:07.370
Anthony Taylor: Any kind of automation requires macros and vba, which is just another programming language. Fortunately, we don't teach that one here anymore.

96
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:13.499
Anthony Taylor:  in spreadsheets. It's hard to like load them from external sources.

97
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:20.879
Anthony Taylor: and that's pretty much it. So I mean, you guys have all worked with spreadsheets before. Do you have any other thoughts on that

98
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:27.910
Anthony Taylor: hard coded. That's true, thank you, Meredith, that's a good one. Meredith probably works with spreadsheets more than anybody in

99
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.540
Anthony Taylor: my guess.

100
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.820
Anthony Taylor: Anybody else have, like horror stories about spreadsheets they want to share

101
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.820
Anthony Taylor: have to encourage. You guys are eating right? Carrie's on camera. Now.

102
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:46.920
Anthony Taylor: accountants love excel. Of course they do until they find something better.

103
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.900
Masarirambi, Rodney: I'm not a fan. not a fan.

104
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:56.999
Masarirambi, Rodney: sometimes I have to do like the bulk imports, like, you know, like edit like,

105
00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:25.019
Masarirambi, Rodney: customers like, you know, like customers, user information. And that kind of stuff. And it becomes messy to use excel, and like once it gets too large. So I split between working numbers and that. But if I could find something else that was like better to to work with, II would. But it's like it's the the the fun one is like when you open up something that's just way too large couple of megabytes. And then you're just. And then your entire computer locks up in your like, yeah, it's it's yeah.

106
00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:33.760
Anthony Taylor: Well, we're gonna teach you ways to get around all of that now. So they they like to compare pandas to excel. And and it's not entirely inaccurate

107
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:44.380
Anthony Taylor: there, you know Panda's works in rows and columns at a very general sense similar to a spreadsheet.

108
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:57.630
Anthony Taylor:  and it can consume, I mean, look at all these things that can consume right? You. Csv, excel Parkay, which you guys will learn about later. HTML, Hdfs, that's Duke File System

109
00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:03.370
Anthony Taylor: Json, which looks like dictionaries, Google, Bigquery, SQL. And more.

110
00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:09.650
Anthony Taylor: And it can write out to the same thing. A lot of people will use pandas for

111
00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.329
Anthony Taylor: like data engineering

112
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.769
Anthony Taylor: and that kind of stuff. Again.

113
00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:22.239
Anthony Taylor: I don't use pandas for data engineering. I use Pispart. But it's again a very similar type of design. Okay.

114
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.410
Anthony Taylor: a data frame

115
00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:38.420
Anthony Taylor: is. And and II wanna, I'm gonna I might even send this into the curriculum team. a data frame. Our pandas works with 2 main data types. And they're new.

116
00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:44.810
Anthony Taylor: Right? You guys haven't heard of these until today. It's important to understand. They work with a series.

117
00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.289
Anthony Taylor: and they work with a data frame

118
00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.720
effectively.

119
00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:52.910
Anthony Taylor: A series is a single column.

120
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:59.009
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So if you think of an Excel spreadsheet. And it's got like 6 columns.

121
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's really 6 series.

122
00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.840
Anthony Taylor: all connected with a single index.

123
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:16.019
Anthony Taylor: A data frame is a series is a bunch of series connected with a single index.

124
00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:21.870
Anthony Taylor: So if you'd like name, first name, last, name, address, phone number.

125
00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:32.380
Anthony Taylor: you could individually print those out as a series. Or if a data frame, you would have a single index that would link all of those columns.

126
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.760
Anthony Taylor: That is a data frame.

127
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.160
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

128
00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:44.529
Anthony Taylor: that's important. So let's go look at what this looks like in code.

129
00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:58.969
Anthony Taylor: It's coming. I don't know what's going on. There it goes.

130
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.220
Anthony Taylor: Oh, you know what I think I was there that whole time? Okay.

131
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:12.759
Anthony Taylor: so everybody should have done this already. If you have not, let's make sure we do it now. So you're going to import pandas as Pd.

132
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:18.470
Anthony Taylor: okay, we just do as Pd, so we don't have to type pandas every time we use. Pd.

133
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:23.430
Anthony Taylor: so we're gonna run this. if this does not run.

134
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:26.630
Anthony Taylor: You need to let me know.

135
00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.650
Anthony Taylor: Is this running for everybody?

136
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:34.960
Anthony Taylor: Has anyone not run it yet?

137
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:50.240
Anthony Taylor: Cindy, are you good, Clayton? Okay, you're good.

138
00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.490
Anthony Taylor: How's it going for you, Buddy?

139
00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:56.729
Anthony Taylor: That's all right. No rush

140
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.230
Clayton Graves: is Anthony.

141
00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:10.260
Anthony Taylor: Oh, well, yeah, that's the normal, like any notebook. When you find, let me know when you get that. Clayton. Yeah, Meredith.

142
00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:22.789
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Oh, I was just asking if is is Pd, basically, you're you're assigning it kind of a nickname or a shortcut. Okay.

143
00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.970
Anthony Taylor: everybody else is good. Just waiting on you, Clayton, or no.

144
00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:44.559
Kanouff, Christine: I thought I was. I thought I had everything. But I don't. So I'm just okay, that's alright. Alright, here's what I want you guys to look at my screen.

145
00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.870
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I'm gonna click code.

146
00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:49.930
Anthony Taylor: make a new cell.

147
00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:54.039
Anthony Taylor: And I'm gonna type. PIP.

148
00:15:54.480 --> 00:16:01.040
Anthony Taylor: Space install space pandas.

149
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:04.120
Kanouff, Christine: and then just run that cell.

150
00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:10.009
Anthony Taylor: It might take a second or 2. Well, even 20 or 30 s.

151
00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:16.739
Anthony Taylor: But when it's done. You can delete that cell, and you never have to do it again. at least not on this computer.

152
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:32.449
Anthony Taylor: Now, you could have done this through your terminal for those of you that are curious. Why, I didn't do it through the terminal is. if you have more than one python or anything like that on your computer.

153
00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:41.849
Anthony Taylor: Doing it through your terminal can be a real can can lead you down the wrong path. So by doing it in the Jupiter Notebook. I know

154
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:49.140
Anthony Taylor: it's going to the python kernel that you're using. So now that it's done, I'm just gonna delete the cell, we don't need it anymore.

155
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:53.020
Anthony Taylor: and then try to run import pandas again.

156
00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:01.040
Kanouff, Christine: So should this be in lesson. 4.

157
00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.939
Anthony Taylor: Module for lesson or doing activity. One.

158
00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:09.160
Kanouff, Christine: Yeah, I don't know. For some weird reason.

159
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:14.730
Kanouff, Christine: Let's see.

160
00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:26.449
Kanouff, Christine: yeah, I've done my get pull several times. And did you do it since class started today? Because we only put it in like it. Yeah, I just did it again. Let me try it one more. Time

161
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.749
Kanouff, Christine: never had issues before.

162
00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.550
Anthony Taylor: And sure it'll turn up.

163
00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:40.330
Anthony Taylor: What's a list. Clayton.

164
00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:54.419
Masarirambi, Rodney: Oh, that was from when he was when you were talking about the data,

165
00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.800
Masarirambi, Rodney: the cells and the lists of the

166
00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:02.629
Masarirambi, Rodney: yeah.

167
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:09.200
Anthony Taylor: How's it looking, Christine?

168
00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:13.499
Kanouff, Christine: I'm getting just an error that says

169
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:17.730
Kanouff, Christine: your local changes to the following files would be over merge.

170
00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:23.240
Kanouff, Christine: I've got that Ds so store thing again going on.

171
00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.290
Anthony Taylor: and then you would get pull again.

172
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:38.419
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I had to do a get commit, and then I get stash before

173
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:44.479
Meredith McCanse (she/her): yeah, cause I know it won't push anything there. But that's true. Maybe you could do a commit locally.

174
00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:48.449
Meredith McCanse (she/her): It wouldn't. I couldn't get past.

175
00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:51.799
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I couldn't get I couldn't. I can't pull. If I don't do it.

176
00:18:51.970 --> 00:19:00.770
Clayton Graves: Why, why, why are we doing a commit, or are are we trying to pull this? We stop. Is that what's going on? Okay.

177
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.099
Anthony Taylor: alright, are we? Good Christine?

178
00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:11.019
Kanouff, Christine: Yeah, it's here. Now, thank you.

179
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:12.460
Anthony Taylor: Not a problem.

180
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So first thing we're gonna do

181
00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.469
Anthony Taylor: import pandas.

182
00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.990
Anthony Taylor: And then the next thing

183
00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:27.110
Anthony Taylor: we're going to create a series.

184
00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:32.429
Anthony Taylor: Now, the way we do that is we're gonna we have a variable. This could be anything

185
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:36.869
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna run. Pd, which is the alias, or

186
00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:41.460
Anthony Taylor: my mouse is stop working.

187
00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:45.530
Anthony Taylor: Pd, which is the alias for Pandas.

188
00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:53.729
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And then the method is series and then to the series, we're going to pass a list

189
00:19:55.080 --> 00:20:05.279
Anthony Taylor: now. I don't want you to stress on this too much right now, but a list in pandas is

190
00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:10.600
Anthony Taylor: I'm sorry. A series in pandas is, in fact, a list.

191
00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:15.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so we're gonna run this, and it will create

192
00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.269
Anthony Taylor: a series and looks like this. Now I will tell you

193
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:28.740
Anthony Taylor: for the next few weeks. Every time you see something that looks like this there's an index and a single column of data.

194
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:38.440
Anthony Taylor: You can rest assured that this is a a series.

195
00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:40.929
I apologize. Guys, I'm having

196
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.350
Anthony Taylor: mouse issues.

197
00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:47.929
Anthony Taylor: not a problem. I got another one.

198
00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:54.500
Anthony Taylor: Come on. Wait a minute.

199
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.429
Anthony Taylor: No, I don't want you on that one on this computer, please.

200
00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.150
Anthony Taylor: I know

201
00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.370
Anthony Taylor: almost. There we're done. Okay.

202
00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:30.440
Anthony Taylor: anyway.

203
00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:32.659
Anthony Taylor: Maybe not.

204
00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:44.729
Anthony Taylor: There it goes. So we took this list, and we converted it into a series. If we take

205
00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:46.820
Anthony Taylor: 2 lists.

206
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:57.300
Anthony Taylor: Oh, no, sorry! Oh, oh, that's kind of a weird jump. Okay? So that's the way we create a series to create a data frame which, remember, is

207
00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.259
more than one series

208
00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:03.219
Anthony Taylor: we're going to in this case. And and I love this

209
00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:06.730
Anthony Taylor: this terminology. We're going to make a list

210
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.030
Anthony Taylor: of dictionaries.

211
00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:13.400
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so the key

212
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:18.640
Anthony Taylor: will be the column name.

213
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.070
Anthony Taylor: And then the values

214
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:28.200
Anthony Taylor: will be the column data. So you can see here we have state that'll be a column.

215
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.660
Anthony Taylor: New Jersey

216
00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:35.720
Anthony Taylor: abbreviation in J. State, new York abbreviation in Y.

217
00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:39.599
Anthony Taylor: And then from that list of dictionaries.

218
00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:51.680
Anthony Taylor: we're going to use the PD data frame method and have a data frame. We'll run that. And it looks like this. So again, I want you to notice how Jupiter displays this.

219
00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:56.570
Anthony Taylor: If you see anything in this format, it is probably a data frame.

220
00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:00.760
Anthony Taylor: What is this format? Well, you can see the column headers.

221
00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:05.650
Anthony Taylor: You can see an index. And you can see data.

222
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:07.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

223
00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:18.750
Anthony Taylor: so this is a data frame. Another way to create a data frame is a dictionary of lists.

224
00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:34.419
Anthony Taylor: So I love it. So people say, oh, you have a list, a dictionary, or a dictionary of lists. In a way you can make a data frame. The only difference is is we call Pd data frame a dictionary of list. The key is the column name.

225
00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:40.950
Anthony Taylor: and the value is a list of all of the data values under that column.

226
00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:49.130
Anthony Taylor: So dynasty, early dynastic period, old Kingdom, Pharaoh, thinnest Farrow Memphis.

227
00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.280
Anthony Taylor: Then when you run this.

228
00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:54.500
Anthony Taylor: you'll see it makes a data frame

229
00:23:55.690 --> 00:24:00.929
Anthony Taylor: alright. So it's only 3 things that to remember today are in this discussion.

230
00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:10.020
Anthony Taylor: A series is a single column. Okay. I can make a data frame 2 ways. Right now.

231
00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:14.100
Anthony Taylor: I can make one with a list of dictionary items.

232
00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:21.890
Anthony Taylor: Where every key is A is a column header. and the value follows it immediately.

233
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:26.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay, or I can make a dictionary

234
00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:37.820
Anthony Taylor: of lists which the key is the name of the column, and the list is all of the data values of that column. Now, one thing about this. What if I put another

235
00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.549
Anthony Taylor: seeing right here. Click

236
00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:45.919
Anthony Taylor: alright. Let's see what happens.

237
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:54.320
Anthony Taylor: So now we have 3 in this column, but 2 in that column.

238
00:24:56.180 --> 00:25:00.180
Anthony Taylor: Oh. this is an important statement.

239
00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:04.159
Anthony Taylor: All arrays or lists must be the same length.

240
00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:08.949
Anthony Taylor: So each of these items have to be the same.

241
00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.800
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you can't have an uneven number.

242
00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.609
Anthony Taylor: and that goes for the dictionary list up above as well.

243
00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:21.780
Anthony Taylor: Okay, there are ways around that. But we'll worry about that when the time comes.

244
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:25.250
Anthony Taylor: Okay. any questions.

245
00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:30.590
Anthony Taylor: It seems like such a small amount of stuff to show you. That's why I'm kinda like.

246
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:34.090
Anthony Taylor: that's it. That's really it.

247
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:40.399
Baro, Sonja: Okay, so let's do an activity, hey, Anthony Anthony, I did have a question.

248
00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:48.609
Baro, Sonja: So if you imported a data frame and it had no values in

249
00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.760
Baro, Sonja: some of the data.

250
00:25:53.530 --> 00:26:01.480
Baro, Sonja: what? How does that work. If what we just saw said, you can't have that happen.

251
00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.240
Anthony Taylor: you would have to type a blank.

252
00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:14.450
Anthony Taylor: You don't have to do that. You're never gonna import a data frame this way. This is just teaching. We're like starting you with, this is the data frame. Before we're done today, you'll import files.

253
00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:21.749
Anthony Taylor: And then you'll that's a good question right now. I mean, if you really wanted to do that, you could do comma quote

254
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:23.160
Anthony Taylor: and

255
00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:28.459
Anthony Taylor: like, if we wanted to put that king tut in there. But we didn't know what dynasty that was

256
00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:36.760
Anthony Taylor: we could do. That's probably an actual barrel impact there. But we could do that. And because we put a blank there.

257
00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:38.599
Anthony Taylor: we could get away with it.

258
00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.090
Okay.

259
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:45.100
Anthony Taylor: but you just have to have the same number of values. That's all. Okay.

260
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.960
Anthony Taylor: So let's look at the activity.

261
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.690
Anthony Taylor: I think you're gonna be pleased.

262
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:58.760
Anthony Taylor: All you're gonna do is you're gonna create a data frame. The data frame should contain 3 columns and have 4 rows of data.

263
00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:07.369
Anthony Taylor: Use an alternative method, create one for an archive. So basically wants you to do a list of dictionaries, data frame

264
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:12.350
Anthony Taylor: and a dictionary of list data frame one for each one of these.

265
00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:18.149
Anthony Taylor: Okay, pretty straightforward. Just look at the instructor activity.

266
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.850
Anthony Taylor: Alright, let me get

267
00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:24.869
Clayton Graves: guys go in. Stride with

268
00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:30.990
Clayton Graves: was just starting to hit my stride in python and know this.

269
00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.800
Anthony Taylor: You do understand? This is just python, right?

270
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:37.950
Clayton Graves: Yeah. But it it's it's different.

271
00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:42.140
Anthony Taylor: It's not, it really is not. It's just the another step.

272
00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:50.320
Anthony Taylor: It's it's exactly python. There's no difference. We are not going to do anything but python for the rest of the course.

273
00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:56.360
Anthony Taylor: So you guys will be fine. Everything is just a continuation of the next thing.

274
00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:00.610
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Hey, Anthony, can I ask your question.

275
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:04.600
Meredith McCanse (she/her): We were still on the last step. And just can I just

276
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:17.259
Meredith McCanse (she/her): get confirmation that we were sort of headed in the right direction? Why don't you share and show us what you did, and we'll finish up. Okay? Well, I'm gonna share. And this I was not the driver Rodney was. But I'm gonna

277
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:33.569
Meredith McCanse (she/her): we sort of we're just getting started on this one. I said, the cell here. I think that so for this one where we're creating a dictionary containing lists. I think what we have to do is like. So it's gonna be ornate. And then it's gonna be 15 and 100. So those are the

278
00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.339
Meredith McCanse (she/her): to the 2.

279
00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:41.340
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Am I doing that right? And then classical would be 1250, and 200

280
00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:44.589
Anthony Taylor: correct? If you're only doing 2 columns. Yup.

281
00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:47.669
Anthony Taylor: you can run that after you do that.

282
00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:54.209
Meredith McCanse (she/her): because that is, that is my understanding is we're supposed to take this and create a dictionary containing the lists

283
00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:59.340
Meredith McCanse (she/her): correct would be frame column price column sales call or

284
00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.270
Anthony Taylor: frame price sales.

285
00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:10.129
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Oh, so should that actually be here instead of the way they have it drawn there. That's what they

286
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:13.090
Meredith McCanse (she/her): okay, it's got it. Okay?

287
00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:16.050
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So this would just be like column one.

288
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:20.219
Anthony Taylor: So then we would capture to do this really fast.

289
00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.589
Anthony Taylor: you could write the name of the column.

290
00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:26.330
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then just copy that whole list

291
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:32.219
Anthony Taylor: and paste it as the value. or you could put the the variable itself

292
00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.170
Anthony Taylor: since that list.

293
00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:41.130
Anthony Taylor: So here, let me show you guys, let me show you, since you have it on your screen.

294
00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:46.209
So right here, you're creating a dictionary, right? So you have your curly bracket.

295
00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.700
Anthony Taylor: Now, I'd call this

296
00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.309
Anthony Taylor: frame instead of one. Call it frame.

297
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:52.570
Okay?

298
00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.959
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Because that's the name of this. Now.

299
00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:04.830
Anthony Taylor: after this, after the Colon delete all of that, and put frame column a variable.

300
00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:12.099
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So delete delete all of that. Yeah.

301
00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.640
Anthony Taylor: And now put frame column tab

302
00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:19.980
Anthony Taylor: comma. So now you have a key, and a list

303
00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:27.680
Meredith McCanse (she/her): list got the square brackets and everything up above, so we don't have to.

304
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:31.690
Anthony Taylor: Exactly. Is everybody following what I'm saying.

305
00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:36.019
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I would not have figured that out

306
00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:42.950
Anthony Taylor: now. You could. Just so you understand. It put sales as the next one, and then actually copy the list this time.

307
00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:45.930
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay

308
00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.149
Anthony Taylor: to Colon, and then copy the actual list.

309
00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:53.690
Anthony Taylor: Just so well with the brackets, or you can, unless you're gonna make your own brackets.

310
00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.360
Meredith McCanse (she/her): got it okay?

311
00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.980
Anthony Taylor: And then from there.

312
00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:05.329
Anthony Taylor: do like, give it a data frame name.

313
00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.390
Meredith McCanse (she/her): And

314
00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:13.630
Meredith McCanse (she/her): and then it would.

315
00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:17.190
Anthony Taylor: Pd, dot data for data frame oops.

316
00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:23.550
Anthony Taylor: You're just gonna put that variable in there.

317
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:25.580
Meredith McCanse (she/her): This one.

318
00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:31.490
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. And now run that well, oh, no way. And then show it. Dict to

319
00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.470
Meredith McCanse (she/her): that's to.

320
00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:41.990
Meredith McCanse (she/her): And private sales.

321
00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:52.309
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, yeah, I was not quite. I don't think we just weren't quite there yet. So thank you. I think everybody learns something there, right? Anybody have any questions

322
00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:56.650
Anthony Taylor: for Meredith, our shower of the moment.

323
00:31:58.300 --> 00:31:59.800
Anthony Taylor: Everybody understood that.

324
00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:03.960
Anthony Taylor: Okay, well, then, I will take over

325
00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:07.040
Baro, Sonja: Anthony the question I have was

326
00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:15.889
Baro, Sonja: so, the just referencing the fact that it was a list. What you were doing the last way was so much more

327
00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:20.150
Baro, Sonja: smooth. Right? Cause I we just doing that way we went.

328
00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:23.200
Baro, Sonja: the taking the data that was in a list

329
00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:31.429
Baro, Sonja: and creating a dictionary, and then just using the definition of what was in that list, the variable itself.

330
00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:34.080
Baro, Sonja: and then everything came with it.

331
00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:44.809
Baro, Sonja: My question was, Why did you have Meredith on the last one with sales? You had her put in instead of the the sales

332
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:52.460
Anthony Taylor: I would have put the I mean normally you would have put the variable on all of them, but I wanted her to. I wanted her to have in her example.

333
00:32:52.530 --> 00:33:00.409
Anthony Taylor: and she had the list, the variables in the first 2, and then the last one, just I mean just to show that you could've put the list there as well.

334
00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:08.369
Baro, Sonja: Okay. demonstration. Really, you would put the variable if you yeah.

335
00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:10.999
Anthony Taylor: So no, that's good stuff. Very good.

336
00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:14.959
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So you guys have made a data frame couple of them. Now.

337
00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:22.209
Anthony Taylor: So let's jump right into, let's find the way. We will normally get data using pandas.

338
00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:23.470
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

339
00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:27.570
Anthony Taylor: And that will be via a file.

340
00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:31.509
Anthony Taylor: Close some of these other ones.

341
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.820
Anthony Taylor: Alright. the.

342
00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:41.650
Anthony Taylor: So of course, we got to import pandas.

343
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:44.569
Anthony Taylor: And now we're gonna

344
00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.530
Anthony Taylor: create a path

345
00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:57.000
Anthony Taylor: to our directory. Now, I want to show you guys how this works. Okay, I'm going to create a variable file equals quote. And then I'm just gonna type.

346
00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:58.480
Anthony Taylor: dot.

347
00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:02.170
Anthony Taylor: okay. waiting

348
00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:04.640
Anthony Taylor: dot

349
00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:10.170
Anthony Taylor: there we go. So if I put in like dot slash

350
00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:17.700
Anthony Taylor: or dot dot slash. what it's gonna do is on mine, anyway, it's going to.

351
00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:20.240
Anthony Taylor: Show me

352
00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:29.710
Anthony Taylor: the files that are at that level. So dot slash. That means I'm looking in the directory. I'm in right now. So dot slash.

353
00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:34.310
Anthony Taylor: See? There's output and panda reading files. So I'm right here.

354
00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:37.270
Anthony Taylor: You can see. Here's the file I'm in, and there's output.

355
00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:49.119
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So I want to go to resources, which is up here and inside of resources. I want this file.

356
00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:52.489
Anthony Taylor: So I know I have to go out one.

357
00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:59.189
Anthony Taylor: Okay from cell. Do I need to go out and then over. So I'm going to do dot dot

358
00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:00.930
Anthony Taylor: slash.

359
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:07.520
Anthony Taylor: and then it's going to show me. And I want to go to resources so I can type resources

360
00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:13.509
Anthony Taylor: hit Tab, and then it'll show me the next thing, and that's my file. So I'll hit Tab again.

361
00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:20.049
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and that's how I'm getting this now is that working for everybody else? Because I think it might be an extension

362
00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:24.110
Anthony Taylor: when you type dot dot slash. Are you seeing the path or no

363
00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:27.749
Anthony Taylor: hurry is sunny? Is not

364
00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:30.450
Anthony Taylor: anybody else

365
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:34.620
Anthony Taylor: you are. I don't know why son is not

366
00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:39.440
Dipinto, Matt: on your inside quotes while you're doing it. It doesn't. I tried it without.

367
00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:42.310
Anthony Taylor: Okay, are you in? Quotes Sonia.

368
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:44.500
Anthony Taylor: And it's not doing it, or it is.

369
00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.289
Baro, Sonja: Yeah, I'm close. It's not doing it.

370
00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:52.889
Baro, Sonja: Let me see real quick. Sure. Yeah. 1 s.

371
00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:06.319
Baro, Sonja: So right here, right, hey, let me come down.

372
00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.800
Anthony Taylor: We gotta do dot dot slash.

373
00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:12.650
Baro, Sonja: Now I will just do Nickel's quote.

374
00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:14.920
Anthony Taylor: dot dot slash.

375
00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:18.720
Derek Rikke: You gotta import pandas.

376
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:23.700
Anthony Taylor: Maybe you should arrive. Well.

377
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:31.040
Anthony Taylor: Kernel, yet. Okay, never mind. It was the kernel. It didn't. You didn't need to import bandwidth. You needed to add the kernel.

378
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:34.690
Anthony Taylor: No, you don't need to run it. but go try it again.

379
00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:39.659
Anthony Taylor: Dot dot slash.

380
00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:45.559
Anthony Taylor: Okay backspace again all the way past the quote

381
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:48.990
Anthony Taylor: now quotes

382
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.100
Anthony Taylor: Dot dot slash

383
00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:55.120
Anthony Taylor: there.

384
00:36:55.530 --> 00:37:02.900
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so you do have to have a kernel running. Otherwise it doesn't even know you're trying to do python.

385
00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:09.470
Anthony Taylor:  alright.

386
00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:14.209
Anthony Taylor: So that's how we that's one way we can find a path.

387
00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.930
Anthony Taylor: Well, actually, let's see if there's anything.

388
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:20.330
Anthony Taylor: A

389
00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:26.560
yeah.

390
00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.139
Anthony Taylor: I think that's more confusing than what we're doing. So

391
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:33.340
Anthony Taylor: okay, so

392
00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:40.739
Anthony Taylor: we have our file, and we're just gonna load that path into a variable.

393
00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:43.140
Now

394
00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:46.980
Anthony Taylor: for pandas to read this, and actually, before I even read it.

395
00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:55.019
Anthony Taylor: let me jump in here. let's go look at it. You guys can look at it also. just click on it.

396
00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:58.300
and you'll be able to see it in Vs code.

397
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.349
Anthony Taylor: I do like Rainbow Csv. By the way I use this at work all the time.

398
00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:09.709
Anthony Taylor:  What it does you'll see when you look at the file now.

399
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:17.140
Anthony Taylor: when we re. When it's done, these will, each column will be a different color. So it's really easy to tell which column is which.

400
00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:21.550
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so basically, we're going to

401
00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:24.710
load all of this data into a data frame.

402
00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:32.219
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So back to here. So this is the path to the file we were just looking at.

403
00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:38.319
Anthony Taylor: Now we're going to say, Pd, pandus dot read. Csv.

404
00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:41.550
Anthony Taylor: we're going to pass in the path.

405
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:45.590
Anthony Taylor: Now, this is going to be confusing, but bear with me

406
00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:49.620
Anthony Taylor: because most of our

407
00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.050
Anthony Taylor: curriculum writers.

408
00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:56.689
Anthony Taylor: our very artsy fart scene.

409
00:38:57.310 --> 00:39:00.900
Anthony Taylor: They use macintoshes. Okay?

410
00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:02.979
Anthony Taylor: And because of that.

411
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:07.540
Anthony Taylor: we now have to do a special encoding for the rest of the world.

412
00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:10.899
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So

413
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:16.140
Anthony Taylor: this encoding will make sure that the file is read

414
00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:28.030
Anthony Taylor: that all letters look proper. Basically. Okay. you don't always need it. But if something goes wrong or it gives you an error. Usually, that means you need encoding.

415
00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:32.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we're going to run this. This will create a data frame.

416
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:35.700
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

417
00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:39.409
Anthony Taylor: Well, unless there's an unless you forget to import pandas.

418
00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:48.869
Anthony Taylor: So you don't need import pandas to get that dot dot. But you do have to have a kernel. I want to rewrite all this.

419
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:53.290
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so now we have a data frame.

420
00:39:53.720 --> 00:40:03.730
Anthony Taylor: And if we wanted to see just the top, because, remember, that was a lot of data, right? I mean, we could put we could just come in here and say, Show me the whole thing

421
00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:09.730
Anthony Taylor: and run this.

422
00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:17.749
Anthony Taylor: And it's gonna show us there's a hundred rows. That's kind of a lot of mess on the screen.

423
00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:28.480
Anthony Taylor: So if I only want to see a couple of rows. Let's say the first 5 I can do ahead right, and this will show me the first 5. You can actually put any number you want in here.

424
00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:32.530
Anthony Taylor: and it'll show you that. But if you don't put anything

425
00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:34.540
Anthony Taylor: it'll show you the first 5.

426
00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:46.010
Anthony Taylor: Okay. if you just want to see one column you can put the name of your data frame in brackets. You can put the column name

427
00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:55.639
Anthony Taylor: and then head, and it'll show you the first 500, pop, quiz, hot shot.

428
00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:59.210
Anthony Taylor: What data type is this up here?

429
00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:06.820
Anthony Taylor: Anybody?

430
00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:08.020
Baro, Sonja: The string

431
00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:10.010
Sihong Zhou: free? Hello!

432
00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:17.799
Anthony Taylor: There's only 2 different frame or data types we've talked about. Okay? And then what's this one?

433
00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.519
Baro, Sonja: I'm serious.

434
00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:21.190
Anthony Taylor: Serialist.

435
00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:23.380
Anthony Taylor: Why do you think it's a series

436
00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:32.100
Baro, Sonja: cause? It's got an an index and only one value correct. But we are reading from our data frame

437
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:39.560
Anthony Taylor: what? Because we're only reading one column. It's a series returns a series.

438
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:43.790
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. So now in this one, I want to see 2 columns

439
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:46.449
Anthony Taylor: before I run it. What's it going to return?

440
00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:52.690
Mcpherson, Michael: Full name, full full name and email

441
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:55.709
Anthony Taylor: perfect. But is it going to be a series or a data frame

442
00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:56.690
Sihong Zhou: frame

443
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:58.189
Meredith McCanse (she/her): data framework

444
00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:01.690
Anthony Taylor: data frame, because it's gonna add 2 columns.

445
00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:04.030
and therefore it can't be a series.

446
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:10.290
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now, if we want to see the last 5 rows of a data frame. We can do tail.

447
00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:20.420
Anthony Taylor: That shows us the last 5 and then, if we want to write it out to a new file.

448
00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:26.420
Anthony Taylor: We can do exactly the opposite of what we did above. We're going to say 2 Csv

449
00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:28.150
Anthony Taylor: instead of

450
00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:35.519
Anthony Taylor: read Csa here. Okay. we're going to actually do 2 Csv

451
00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:39.800
Anthony Taylor: went too far. And then we're gonna put a path.

452
00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:49.519
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to say, index equals false. You don't have to say index equals false. But if you don't, you're going to get this number on the left.

453
00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:53.300
Anthony Taylor: Notice, this number on the left does not have a column header.

454
00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:59.069
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that is the index. Just like in a list.

455
00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:13.229
Anthony Taylor: We don't usually want to print the index in a data frame. So in this case it does not have an item or a a a list. We don't want to include it. So we say index equals false. We do want to include our column headers.

456
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:15.889
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna say, header equals true.

457
00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:18.070
Anthony Taylor: So we run this.

458
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:22.040
Anthony Taylor: And now if we go to output.

459
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:25.549
Anthony Taylor: you will see the file was created.

460
00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:28.460
Anthony Taylor: Pretty exciting.

461
00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:32.050
Anthony Taylor: and that is all.

462
00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:36.670
Sihong Zhou: I have one question go for it, Sandy.

463
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:39.060
Sihong Zhou: so like. Now

464
00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:43.400
Sihong Zhou: it is under output. Right?

465
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:55.190
Anthony Taylor: So what if I want to put it somewhere else? Can I change it? Let's do it. Let's just let's just do it. Let's just do it. Where do you think we would change it? Looking at my screen right now.

466
00:43:55.810 --> 00:43:58.840
Sihong Zhou: I think we change it to

467
00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:10.579
Sihong Zhou:  to just under under third, like in rating writing like the big.

468
00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:13.500
Sihong Zhou: this documentation.

469
00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:19.309
Anthony Taylor: So like, right here, okay, this is where you tell it where to go.

470
00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:26.460
Sihong Zhou: Oh, okay. So I'll so we can say, Look, if I get rid of output.

471
00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:27.570
Huh!

472
00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:32.279
Anthony Taylor: We will, and run it. It's going to put it in the same folder I'm in now.

473
00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:36.170
Sihong Zhou: So now it's not an output. It's just sitting right here.

474
00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:39.820
Sihong Zhou: Okay, got it? Well, it's also an output, cause we wrote it there, too. But

475
00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:42.430
Anthony Taylor: but anyway, you can put any path you want here.

476
00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:45.450
Anthony Taylor: Alright, and it'll create it.

477
00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:48.330
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

478
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:56.630
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Now, I'm not going to send you off to an activity yet. I have something else to show you. So

479
00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.110
Anthony Taylor: we can now

480
00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:08.030
Anthony Taylor: read in a file which is awesome.

481
00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:16.669
Anthony Taylor: Let's import pandas. We're gonna do that pretty much every single time we do anything going forward.

482
00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:21.460
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna read in this file here. and it looks like

483
00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:26.300
that. Oh, boy!

484
00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:32.400
Anthony Taylor: And aren't you glad you don't have to make a dictionary, a list of that?

485
00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:37.029
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So it's 500 rows of data.

486
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:39.010
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

487
00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:44.759
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna pull that in. Take a look at the first 5. There they are

488
00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:46.420
Anthony Taylor: okay.

489
00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:50.689
Anthony Taylor: So we have an idea of what we're looking at.

490
00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:59.720
Anthony Taylor: And let's get a list of the columns, because there's a lot of columns there. Right? So let's grab a list of them by typing the data frame name

491
00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:05.540
Anthony Taylor: dot columns. And actually let me show you guys something people underscore. Df, remember.

492
00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:06.930
Anthony Taylor: you spell it right?

493
00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:15.189
Anthony Taylor: And you hit the period. It'll show you all of the things you can do with a data frame.

494
00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.120
Anthony Taylor: There's a lot

495
00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:23.529
Anthony Taylor: okay in this case, I just want to see the columns

496
00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:27.440
Anthony Taylor: that are available in this data frame. So

497
00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:31.139
Anthony Taylor: question. what is this?

498
00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:40.599
Meredith McCanse (she/her): It's a list. Thank you very much, Meredith, it is a list.

499
00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:45.799
Anthony Taylor: So df column people. Df, columns, return me a list

500
00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:54.680
Anthony Taylor: of the columns that are in this table. Alright. if I only wanted to see some of those problems.

501
00:46:55.260 --> 00:47:04.230
Anthony Taylor: I can do well if I wanted to see one, we've already done that right when the last one we did. I only want to see one column. So I could people

502
00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:06.250
Anthony Taylor: underscore. Yeah.

503
00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:08.340
Anthony Taylor: bracket quote.

504
00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:09.580
Anthony Taylor: first name.

505
00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:13.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I hit enter. I see one column

506
00:47:13.810 --> 00:47:17.240
Anthony Taylor: right? Well, if I wanted to see 2

507
00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:25.570
Anthony Taylor: I have to pass into, and and I want to be clear. I have to pass into these brackets

508
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:28.190
Anthony Taylor: a list of columns.

509
00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:30.140
Anthony Taylor: Now.

510
00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:34.029
Anthony Taylor: looking at this, doesn't this look like a list?

511
00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:42.699
Anthony Taylor: It does right? It's square brackets. But now I need to pass in a list

512
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:45.920
Anthony Taylor: which means I'm going to have

513
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:48.580
Anthony Taylor: 2 square brackets.

514
00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:55.199
Anthony Taylor: the square brackets I need to pass in columns and a list of columns I want to see

515
00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:57.900
Anthony Taylor: so bracket bracket.

516
00:47:58.430 --> 00:48:00.260
Anthony Taylor: Now, when you look at this.

517
00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:04.499
Anthony Taylor: you only get the columns that you requested.

518
00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:16.470
Anthony Taylor: Does that make sense to everybody? That bracket bracket thing often confuses people that's and I find that that's the best way to explain it. You have to use the brackets to get one.

519
00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:22.630
Anthony Taylor: but if you need to pass in more than one. You need a list. So you have to pass in another set of brackets.

520
00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:25.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay. alright.

521
00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:28.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So that gives you

522
00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:36.430
Anthony Taylor: a subset of columns. The last thing we're going to learn about column manipulation is how to rename them.

523
00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:44.299
Anthony Taylor: It's a little confusing. but once you understand how to do it, it'll be easy. It'll be

524
00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:48.040
Anthony Taylor: second nature. So you have a data frame name

525
00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:52.929
Anthony Taylor: which we, we rename this one up here. Organized data frame.

526
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:58.269
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so organized data frame dot rename.

527
00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:03.449
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to give a rename is a method is a function. So then we're going to say.

528
00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:07.300
Anthony Taylor: what do we want to rename

529
00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:16.920
Anthony Taylor: columns? We're going to rename the columns. What this is expecting is a dictionary

530
00:49:17.130 --> 00:49:29.719
Anthony Taylor: with the old name as the key and the new name as the value you could pass in one you could pass in 10 passing 100

531
00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:33.650
Anthony Taylor: doesn't matter. So we're going to say rename

532
00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:39.070
Anthony Taylor: columns is what I want and rename, and it equals this dictionary of Items.

533
00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:45.969
Anthony Taylor: where the key is last name. I want you to rename it. It's a last name like this

534
00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:50.329
Anthony Taylor: company name. I want you to Rename Digest company.

535
00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:54.039
Anthony Taylor: Okay, just like that. And then we can run this

536
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:58.449
Anthony Taylor: and take a peek, and then you'll see our data frame as

537
00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:00.230
Anthony Taylor: new names.

538
00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:06.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so let's just go over what we learned here. One.

539
00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:20.580
Anthony Taylor: we already learned how to read a file list columns, dot coms, data frame dot coms. Whatever your data. Frame's name is dot columns. Okay.

540
00:50:22.070 --> 00:50:23.900
Anthony Taylor: powder Pool. One column.

541
00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:33.649
Anthony Taylor: You do it with brack, square brackets. More than one column. You do it with a list inside of square brackets

542
00:50:35.550 --> 00:50:39.689
Anthony Taylor: to rename you do data frame, dot rename.

543
00:50:40.690 --> 00:50:46.750
Anthony Taylor: tell it what you want to rename. And then a dictionary of key value pairs with old Column. New column.

544
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:50.839
Anthony Taylor: Okay, one more, pop, quiz.

545
00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:05.059
Anthony Taylor: What will this do?

546
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:15.009
Anthony Taylor: So I'm gonna do something different. Here I'm going to.

547
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:22.579
Anthony Taylor: I want to rerun everything. I'm going to start at the top. And I want you guys to tell me what that last

548
00:51:22.850 --> 00:51:29.910
Anthony Taylor: one will do. So let's do it. I imported pandas. I imported the file. We're looking at it. Okay.

549
00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:32.260
Anthony Taylor: listed the columns.

550
00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:38.740
Anthony Taylor: I created a new data frame with just these 4 columns.

551
00:51:40.930 --> 00:51:48.780
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, I'm going to skip this one and go to this one. So it's the name of the data frame dot rename

552
00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:52.300
Anthony Taylor: columns equals this.

553
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:55.210
Anthony Taylor: Anybody want to guess what this is going to actually do.

554
00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:58.200
Anthony Taylor: Yes, Brandon.

555
00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:04.389
Mckimmy, Brandon: it renamed it renamed the top edges into

556
00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:05.860
Mckimmy, Brandon: strings.

557
00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:09.260
Anthony Taylor: Good! Is it permanent?

558
00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:16.929
Mckimmy, Brandon:  let's find out. Everyone agrees. This has been re, these are renamed right?

559
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:22.690
Anthony Taylor: Let's type organized yet

560
00:52:22.810 --> 00:52:23.990
Anthony Taylor: and run it. Kit

561
00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:31.310
Anthony Taylor: home. Wait. didn't we just rename those?

562
00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:43.749
Anthony Taylor: So this is an important point. I want you to rename the new data set that you created

563
00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:46.880
Clayton Graves: with the 5 columns. That's what you renamed.

564
00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:54.119
Anthony Taylor: Well, see it. That would be true in this cell. And this is what I wanted to point out. And actually, you're right like.

565
00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:55.679
Anthony Taylor: And this one.

566
00:52:55.750 --> 00:53:00.330
Anthony Taylor: we said, rename these and put it into this data frame.

567
00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:04.859
Anthony Taylor: I skipped this and said, Well, what if I just run this by itself?

568
00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:14.300
Anthony Taylor: So this is what you need to learn about pandas and data frames what I want you to take away. Oh, did you have an answer, Ramy? Sorry before I finish?

569
00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:23.189
Masarirambi, Rodney: Well, cause sorry, I think, from what what you're looking over there. So the second one, because the

570
00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:34.420
Masarirambi, Rodney: we were using with the capital L and capital and for lost name, it sees that as the value which is already present, and takes the other one as the over right.

571
00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:37.100
Masarirambi, Rodney: and we'll make that adjustment.

572
00:53:37.550 --> 00:53:43.529
Anthony Taylor: So I mean, I'm glad that you see that I'm glad you pointed out. My, but no, that's not actually the point on this one.

573
00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:46.559
Masarirambi, Rodney: Okay, it actually did what I expected it.

574
00:53:46.830 --> 00:54:00.380
Anthony Taylor: It did rename them, and it showed you them renamed. But and pandas anytime you do something to a data frame. It is not permanent unless you assign it.

575
00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:03.080
Anthony Taylor: Now you can overwrite your data frame.

576
00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:12.610
Anthony Taylor: That's okay. But because we didn't set this equal to anything when we go to run it again, it just reverts back to what it was before that.

577
00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:16.740
Anthony Taylor: because it was never basically, it just wasn't saved.

578
00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:27.459
Anthony Taylor: So that's why, in the in the example they gave you. they set it equal to a new data frame to a new variable.

579
00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:31.209
Anthony Taylor: But for the record you could totally.

580
00:54:33.290 --> 00:54:35.179
Anthony Taylor: That is perfectly acceptable.

581
00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:42.220
Anthony Taylor: Now, the bad part about doing this is that means you no longer have the previous version.

582
00:54:43.690 --> 00:54:48.380
Anthony Taylor: You're basically taking the version you have. You're renaming the columns and overwriting it.

583
00:54:48.550 --> 00:54:52.380
Anthony Taylor: And now it'll stay that way that make sense to everybody?

584
00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:55.720
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Does that mean that you?

585
00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.100
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Does that mean that

586
00:54:58.210 --> 00:55:03.439
Meredith McCanse (she/her): to make to manipulate the data like that or make changes? You're constantly having to rename it.

587
00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:07.669
Anthony Taylor: Normally, I would just rewrite. I mean, I would just overwrite.

588
00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:10.140
Anthony Taylor: So organized equals organized.

589
00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:14.450
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay, there are times when you still wanna do that.

590
00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:17.819
Anthony Taylor: The the times you don't want to do that are usually around

591
00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:22.440
Anthony Taylor:  dealing with

592
00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:26.149
Anthony Taylor: like like you, you you're not sure.

593
00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:32.689
Anthony Taylor: like I need to do this change, but I don't. Wanna I don't wanna wreck it, because if you wreck it, you have to go back to getting and start over

594
00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:37.450
Meredith McCanse (she/her): alright. Yeah. So like I did when I showed you the example, I went back and started the top.

595
00:55:37.570 --> 00:55:44.810
Anthony Taylor: We ran everything which is fine with these little tiny data frames. But if you're dealing with large data frames, you don't wanna have to do that very often.

596
00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:47.430
Anthony Taylor: Not more than you need to.

597
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:51.629
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Good job. Everybody.

598
00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:54.469
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

599
00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:00.750
Anthony Taylor: okay. new activity.

600
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:19.499
Anthony Taylor: I tell you my little laptop is not as powerful as my one at home. So it's a loose. Okay? So you're gonna import a Csv file. You're gonna note that the column names are inconsistent and difficult to work with.

601
00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:22.060
Anthony Taylor: so rename them to the following.

602
00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:25.269
Anthony Taylor: And it doesn't tell you what the old ones are.

603
00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:32.929
Anthony Taylor: Then you're gonna create a new table, which means a new data frame that contains these 3 columns in this order.

604
00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:36.280
Anthony Taylor: So when you tell it, what columns you want.

605
00:56:36.290 --> 00:56:38.790
Anthony Taylor: you can switch the order. No big deal.

606
00:56:39.130 --> 00:56:42.120
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's still gonna work. And that's it.

607
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:48.880
Anthony Taylor: Okay. pretty sure that's gonna be a 10 min activity. Let me confirm

608
00:56:53.550 --> 00:56:56.460
Anthony Taylor: a.

609
00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:04.340
Anthony Taylor: It's it's no 15 min nice

610
00:57:04.770 --> 00:57:05.790
Anthony Taylor: parking.

611
00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:09.500
Anthony Taylor: So knock this out and we will

612
00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:11.780
Anthony Taylor: go.

613
00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:24.979
Anthony Taylor: Okay for those of us watching the video we came back from break. We did not turn on the recording. So we're gonna quickly go through. What we did. After break

614
00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:33.170
Anthony Taylor: first off we went through indexing. I do thank you. Kev.

615
00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:43.889
Anthony Taylor: That's a good idea. Cause that would really stuck even more. You're just looking at my face. Okay. so here we have. It's coming and it's coming. It's coming.

616
00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:52.089
Anthony Taylor: Oh, my God, this is so slow. Okay, so we're gonna import pandas.

617
00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:59.200
Anthony Taylor: import a file that we're going to use to for our example here.

618
00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:06.560
Anthony Taylor: See, it's really cool. Now remember, the index at this point is just 0 1, 2, 3, 4,

619
00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:11.580
Anthony Taylor: eyelogue, and I like to call it index locate

620
00:58:11.810 --> 00:58:14.859
Anthony Taylor: will allow us to select rows

621
00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:26.109
Anthony Taylor: and or select rows and columns from our data frame, using a number. So number 0 is going to give us this first Alicia row

622
00:58:27.350 --> 00:58:29.860
Anthony Taylor: and we'll pull that and we'll see it.

623
00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:35.829
Anthony Taylor: And just a reminder this would be a series. It's one car. No, it wouldn't. This wouldn't be a series

624
00:58:35.890 --> 00:58:38.040
Anthony Taylor: series is one column, not one.

625
00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:40.240
Anthony Taylor: Here's

626
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:45.900
Anthony Taylor: second row using index one

627
00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:52.300
Anthony Taylor: here we can say, Give me rows. 0 to 1010 is not inclusive. So it's gonna be

628
00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:53.880
Anthony Taylor: 0 to 9

629
00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:56.540
Anthony Taylor: to make sense. It's an index

630
00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:03.780
Anthony Taylor: that return to Data Frame. If we want to see the last row we can do, make it one

631
00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:20.490
Anthony Taylor: so truthfully. This bracket in Eyeloque and Loke, which you'll see in a few minutes holds the rows and the columns you want to see, but we put a colon in by itself. That means give me all rows.

632
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:30.179
Anthony Taylor: and then this would be the first column, because it's 0. So we're asking for all rows. We want the first column. But we only went the head.

633
00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:34.510
Anthony Taylor: Okay. then this one.

634
00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:39.480
Anthony Taylor: We want all rows, but the first go to the second column, which is index one.

635
00:59:42.810 --> 00:59:46.310
Anthony Taylor: Here. We're going to get all rows, but the last column.

636
00:59:51.130 --> 00:59:56.090
Anthony Taylor: and here we're going to get all rows, but we only want 0 to 2.

637
00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:59.500
Anthony Taylor: The 2 is non-inclusive, so it's 0 one. First 2 columns

638
01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:10.970
Anthony Taylor: pretty cool. Huh? We can even get so specific what we can call specific rows and specific columns. If we know their index.

639
01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:20.399
Anthony Taylor: or we can do 0 to 5, 2 to 5, and get certain columns with certain rows.

640
01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:27.260
Anthony Taylor: So all of these are possible with Ilo. We wanted to assign a value to a column using Ilo.

641
01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:31.630
Anthony Taylor: we could say, Hey for row 0. I want you

642
01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:34.399
Anthony Taylor: to get Loke, which

643
01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:37.790
Anthony Taylor: this is not the way I would normally do this you'll see in a minute.

644
01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:43.570
Anthony Taylor:  of the first name column equals and set it equal to aria.

645
01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:49.699
Anthony Taylor: So we can run this. and we'll see now it's no longer Alicia. It's aria.

646
01:00:51.310 --> 01:01:00.640
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now. up till now the index of these rows have always been this number. We're going to now set the index

647
01:01:01.330 --> 01:01:08.629
Anthony Taylor: to the first name column. Now, this first one didn't do anything. Well, why? Because it's not set. It's not.

648
01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:23.939
Anthony Taylor: We didn't assign it to a variable. We're not saying do it in place. The second one, we're going to say, do it in place, and it'll actually overwrite the data frame setting the index. And now you can see it because it's slightly off set.

649
01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.550
That tells me that this is the index

650
01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:28.960
Anthony Taylor: which, using our second

651
01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:36.050
Anthony Taylor: really cool feature. using Loc will allow us to select it based on that value.

652
01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:42.540
Anthony Taylor: But before we do that, let's go ahead and sort our index, which is gonna sort everything by first name.

653
01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:52.850
Anthony Taylor: and now we can say, Look no, I, and search for that first name there, and we will get the row. or the first name is, Evan.

654
01:01:54.200 --> 01:02:01.110
Anthony Taylor: we can, since this is an alphabetical order, they could say, Give us everything between Alicia and Spetlina.

655
01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:03.290
Anthony Taylor: and it'll do that.

656
01:02:05.570 --> 01:02:13.440
Anthony Taylor: But the really cool thing about Loke is the fact that we can now filter. So we can take our data frame download

657
01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:19.730
Anthony Taylor: and in brackets pass in the column the data frame with the column name

658
01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:21.050
Anthony Taylor: and

659
01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:28.759
Anthony Taylor: what we want, a condition that we want it to be equal to. and then return that. And that returns a data frame

660
01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:31.689
Anthony Taylor: which we can then utilize.

661
01:02:33.690 --> 01:02:38.499
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you can also use Loke to assign a value. Since you can say, Loke.

662
01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:46.530
Anthony Taylor: the column, the row you're looking for the column you looking for, and then set it equal to of value.

663
01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:51.290
Anthony Taylor: and that would rewrite it alright.

664
01:02:52.650 --> 01:02:59.419
Anthony Taylor: So again, we're catching up because we've got to push the record. So here's the everyone do that. We did.

665
01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:09.800
Anthony Taylor: So we started.

666
01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:14.929
Anthony Taylor: We imported Pandas and Path Lib.

667
01:03:15.890 --> 01:03:21.729
Anthony Taylor: We read our Csv file in. took a quick peek at it.

668
01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:28.900
Anthony Taylor: and then we listed out the columns with Df. Columns.

669
01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:41.299
Anthony Taylor: Requirements, said I only want IMDB. Columns. So we grab and film. So we grab film. And then all of the columns that hide had had IM. dB, in them.

670
01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:47.540
Anthony Taylor: Notice, there's a really cool alternative way, using list comprehension.

671
01:03:48.990 --> 01:03:54.420
Anthony Taylor: A great question was asked, why is film here? Because film doesn't have IM dB.

672
01:03:54.540 --> 01:04:01.740
Anthony Taylor: So we grab that one explicitly and then use this comprehension to grab the ones that have IM. dB, in the name.

673
01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:07.410
Anthony Taylor: Here we filtered the original data frame

674
01:04:07.790 --> 01:04:13.410
Anthony Taylor: with only movies that had an Imdb score greater than 7,

675
01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:15.030
Anthony Taylor: and showed those

676
01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:19.999
Anthony Taylor: then from those

677
01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:22.699
Anthony Taylor: we filtered again to get

678
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:31.570
Anthony Taylor: only Rose with less than 20,000 boats. and we only wanted these columns. and we took a peek at that.

679
01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:36.970
Anthony Taylor: and lastly, we exported it to an Excel file.

680
01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:46.400
Anthony Taylor: and that was that. And then I sent you off to do the activity that you did in class.

681
01:04:57.550 --> 01:05:00.970
Anthony Taylor: I must confess to all of you we did something horrible.

682
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:04.570
Anthony Taylor: but we fixed it.

683
01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:09.680
Anthony Taylor: We did not record the entire last segment.

684
01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:17.969
Anthony Taylor: But while you guys were in there I went over everything we went over during the last.

685
01:05:20.190 --> 01:05:24.599
Anthony Taylor: So anyway, the only thing we lost was, you guys asking questions?

686
01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:32.479
Anthony Taylor: Did you do all voices whilst you're asking those questions? I could have totally done voices. I'm very good voices

687
01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:35.039
Clayton Graves: that would have been awesome.

688
01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:42.629
Anthony Taylor: But I would have done like Disney voices like Gorsh. Why would you do the names and rackets like that?

689
01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:45.949
Clayton Graves: Is that what I sound like, Anthony?

690
01:05:45.970 --> 01:05:56.800
Anthony Taylor: No. you would. You would be like my, my. probably like my Bronx, you know, like that. What are you talking about with that stuff

691
01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:01.679
which I know is nothing like you, but that would be like.

692
01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:06.520
Anthony Taylor: anyway. Okay. let's go through that real quick.

693
01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:11.480
Anthony Taylor: Anybody finish

694
01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:15.879
Clayton Graves: just out of curiosity. We got close.

695
01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:19.660
Anthony Taylor: It was pretty exciting. That stuff.

696
01:06:30.030 --> 01:06:36.549
Baro, Sonja: Anthony. I used your new, your your fancy little learning. Ex assistant. Real time

697
01:06:36.670 --> 01:06:37.770
Anthony Taylor: they were.

698
01:06:38.090 --> 01:06:39.910
Baro, Sonja: Yes, I did.

699
01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:43.490
Anthony Taylor: and it didn't give you the answer. It made you work for the answer.

700
01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:52.350
Baro, Sonja: Yes, I had to convince that I had. We had figured it out.

701
01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:56.220
Baro, Sonja: Natalie was on it with me

702
01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:03.010
Anthony Taylor: give it a name so that, you guys, when you talk to it, it'll give you it'll it'll be a person

703
01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:08.480
Baro, Sonja: personality. What was ex machina's character, Eva, ava.

704
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:14.529
Anthony Taylor: Oh, there you go! That's not bad. That's I love that show. That was a good meeting.

705
01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:21.060
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Okay? So first, we had to rebuild the file.

706
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:30.060
Anthony Taylor: then. what are we doing? Remove unnecessary columns. Did it give you the list? It told you to keep? It did right?

707
01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:35.009
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So we're going to keep those.

708
01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:39.219
Anthony Taylor: So it's just the double bracket deal.

709
01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:43.380
Anthony Taylor: Then we're gonna rename them.

710
01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:52.669
Anthony Taylor: I mean, I assume you guys understand? Like the rename is just the key value pairs any questions on the renaming.

711
01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:54.520
Anthony Taylor: We're pretty confident with that.

712
01:07:56.010 --> 01:08:03.519
Anthony Taylor: Now, here's where we start getting into the new stuff. So it said. How many comics were published in the sixties. Now.

713
01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:15.589
Anthony Taylor: I don't know how you guys did it in here. We used Loke. which I told you Luke would be your friend. Right? We stay publication year greater than equal to 60 or less than 70,

714
01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:17.839
Anthony Taylor: and then we got the length

715
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:20.470
Anthony Taylor: of the output which gives us

716
01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:23.790
Anthony Taylor: 18. Yes, Gabe

717
01:08:24.029 --> 01:08:29.789
Vasquez, Gabriel: in ours this one was already completed when we when we were in it.

718
01:08:30.670 --> 01:08:34.939
Anthony Taylor: Hot digging dog. Well, that makes it easy. Huh?

719
01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:40.360
Anthony Taylor: So that works. And so for the batman ones.

720
01:08:40.609 --> 01:08:47.850
Anthony Taylor: how many bad man comics are listed? So notice, they keep using this link. If you link to the data frame. It'll tell you how many rows are in it

721
01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:52.660
Anthony Taylor: if I don't think we talked about that before this, so I don't know if anyone knew that.

722
01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:57.960
Anthony Taylor:  So this one just says comic title string contains

723
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:59.220
Anthony Taylor: Batman

724
01:08:59.390 --> 01:09:04.059
Anthony Taylor: and said, Ignore case. So how many people got that? Or was that included? Also

725
01:09:05.550 --> 01:09:11.310
Meredith McCanse (she/her): it was not included. How did you guys get it? What? What kind of like? I'm pretty sure no one did it that way. Right?

726
01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:19.800
Meredith McCanse (she/her): We just said, if the title is batman, because we weren't sure how to use contains in this setup

727
01:09:20.439 --> 01:09:26.740
Anthony Taylor: anybody else? Or Sonia? Is this the one that the helper helped you with. Really. how cool!

728
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:43.069
Anthony Taylor: That makes me very happy that the helper works actually hope that you guys use it a lot. I would rather you use that and get your answer, even though it may be a little longer to get there.

729
01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:45.629
Anthony Taylor: But I feel like you'll learn much more

730
01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:50.279
Anthony Taylor: if you do it that route versus how do I do this? And then it just tells you

731
01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:57.670
Anthony Taylor: right? So I'm glad that you guys did that. Here we got a function where we're just gonna pass in

732
01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:11.270
Anthony Taylor: a search term and return the length. And then we're gonna say. give me all the batman's. That's kind of fun. 423. Well.

733
01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:14.970
Anthony Taylor: technically, you could just run that same function for Superman

734
01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:23.610
Anthony Taylor: 260 and say, there's more batman than Superman, that's it. That was the whole exercise

735
01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:33.130
Clayton Graves: I ended up. Take us down a rabbit hole about comic books that were about batman that didn't have batman in the title. And yeah.

736
01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:34.920
Anthony Taylor: okay.

737
01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:48.680
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Anthony, I have a question in that last example on your screen where it says, Case equals false. Are you telling it that it's not case sensitive

738
01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:51.540
Anthony Taylor: who is draw. I must be timing.

739
01:10:57.580 --> 01:11:01.609
Anthony Taylor: But yeah. so that's pretty much it.

740
01:11:02.710 --> 01:11:14.129
Anthony Taylor: What do you guys think about pandas today? That was pretty good class. They're pretty pretty light. not too hard. I want to point out how many, how many people think. Give me fist? 5. How are we doing today?

741
01:11:16.190 --> 01:11:18.549
Anthony Taylor: I see I see some good numbers.

742
01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:27.310
Anthony Taylor: Good, good, good. Good. Okay. So I want to throw this out there for you. We still did the same number of activities. We've been doing every single class

743
01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:33.380
Anthony Taylor: with the same number of lectures. and it was all new material

744
01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:43.270
Clayton Graves: it was. It's not that it was bad. I just I'm gonna need more time, that's all. Of course. I mean, it was the first day.

745
01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:50.390
Anthony Taylor: But the point is the point I'm trying to make is is this is around the time when you guys are getting used to the pace

746
01:11:50.450 --> 01:11:52.310
Anthony Taylor: and used to the work.

747
01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:57.589
Anthony Taylor: And it's just gonna feel like it's not as much, but it truly is about the same.

748
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.460
traug: I think. Understanding. The paradigm of Python is is the big hurdle.

749
01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:13.470
Anthony Taylor: That's it. Once you get the python figured out. It's all good. All the rest of it's just adding onto it. We're just gonna keep adding more and more into the python stuff.

750
01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:17.759
Anthony Taylor: So it's gonna be great. You guys are gonna be awesome.

751
01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:23.980
Anthony Taylor: anyway. That's all I have, for you have a wonderful Tuesday.

752
01:12:24.230 --> 01:12:29.800
Anthony Taylor: I will see you same place same time on Wednesday, and we will do more pandas.

753
01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:31.420
Thank you.

754
01:12:31.690 --> 01:12:33.379
Anthony Taylor: Cool. Have a good night.

755
01:12:34.290 --> 01:12:36.020
Anthony Taylor: Will be here for 30 min.

756
01:12:39.370 --> 01:12:40.060
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Can I ask.
