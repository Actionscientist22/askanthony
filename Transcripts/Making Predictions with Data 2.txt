1
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:19.970
Anthony Taylor: Welcome to day 3 or day 2. Doc. Gone at Randall. They, too. of data predictions. time series. Version.

2
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.270
Anthony Taylor:  yeah.

3
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.100
Anthony Taylor: So let's get started today is gonna be about as easy as yesterday, maybe

4
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.830
Anthony Taylor: easier.

5
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.259
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So I don't want anybody giving me grief that I'm not challenging you enough.

6
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.320
Anthony Taylor: Rodney will not be here. He's at a Christmas party.

7
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.389
Anthony Taylor: so be sure when he does show up on Monday that we all point in laughing.

8
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.899
Anthony Taylor: And he just saw that cause he's gonna watch the recording

9
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.830
Anthony Taylor: alright, anyway, moving on.

10
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.580
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So

11
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.709
Anthony Taylor: the only really the coolest thing today is we're gonna learn Google Co lab.

12
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:12.780
Anthony Taylor: we are gonna cover some some cool topics. We're gonna start with a little warm up. Basically, this is kind of what you did yesterday.

13
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.670
Anthony Taylor: Same type stuff.

14
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.370
Anthony Taylor: So that's what you're gonna make before the end of the day.

15
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:30.889
Anthony Taylor:  so you're gonna go in. You're gonna load up some data do the Parse state time? It's gonna be the index. You're gonna plot the value.

16
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.789
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So you're gonna plot the whole thing.

17
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.929
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Alright, Anthony, are you sure I should be sharing. I know.

18
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.789
Anthony Taylor: Darn it, I was not. Thank you for letting me know. Let's start over. So you're gonna bring in the file.

19
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.400
Anthony Taylor: You're gonna plot the whole thing.

20
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.689
Anthony Taylor: You're going to plot it with week of year. Okay, now, just a note.

21
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:03.640
Anthony Taylor: This isn't going to work on all of them. Okay. I think hourly works. But week of year does not

22
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:11.779
Anthony Taylor: sliced one day before the little pump. And that's it. So what does that mean the one that doesn't work, which what? What

23
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.450
Anthony Taylor: method you got to use?

24
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.299
Anthony Taylor: And I remember from yesterday.

25
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.500
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Iso Iso calendar. Thank you. Time.

26
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.080
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Iso calendar. So

27
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.240
Anthony Taylor:  yeah. So you're gonna use that to get

28
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.640
Anthony Taylor: week of year. Okay.

29
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.810
Anthony Taylor: I have it in the solution. If you don't get it. don't panic.

30
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.430
Anthony Taylor: You'll have it. Okay, for this

31
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.849
Anthony Taylor: we're going to give you.

32
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.239
Anthony Taylor: I mean, look at that. We're like already in the first activity. Let's see how far ahead we are. Oh, we're not.

33
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.200
Anthony Taylor: I'm late.

34
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.810
Anthony Taylor: 20 min. Gosh.

35
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.069
Anthony Taylor: all right. So started again.

36
00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:09.359
Anthony Taylor: So how'd you guys do any any real issues other than Iso Calendar. I know one group was having a little trouble with Iso Calendar. It's all good.  you know. Basically, they gave you that

37
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:18.290
Anthony Taylor:  my brains. Just my brain is not working tonight. So it was, it was fiasco. But hey, Buddy, it's all good.

38
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.730
Alright, here's the bought the whole thing.

39
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:29.619
Anthony Taylor: Here's for just week. Okay, here's the Isocalager week. That'll give it to you by week.

40
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.080
Anthony Taylor: And then you can do index by hour. That still works.

41
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:43.309
Anthony Taylor: So you can get that which is kind of fun. And then last, you did a range of the 20 seventh through the 30 first.

42
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.100
Anthony Taylor: Any questions. This is just review from yesterday. Yes, I'm

43
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:55.429
Baro, Sonja: yeah. My last one didn't run correctly. Give me this weird monotonic.

44
00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.320
Baro, Sonja: Yeah, I had the same error monotonic. I'm non monotonic.

45
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.069
Baro, Sonja: That's what it's like

46
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.599
Baro, Sonja: here. You want me to show you I would love to show you.

47
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.269
Baro, Sonja: Ta, da! Isn't that beautiful?

48
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:25.100
Anthony Taylor: Oh, value based partial slicing so?

49
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.289
Anthony Taylor: But when we slice on everything. Did you like try to filter it up above?

50
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.240
Baro, Sonja: I mean, did you try somewhere else in your code to to fill, to slice it.

51
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:42.800
Baro, Sonja: No.

52
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.770
Anthony Taylor: I see. Keep going.

53
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.049
Baro, Sonja: That's the last one.

54
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.530
Anthony Taylor: Don't move for 1 Si think

55
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.350
Anthony Taylor: I have a suggestion.

56
00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:04.089
Anthony Taylor: This is the stupidest suggestion I can imagine. But I'm going to make it anyway. Change those double quotes to single quotes.

57
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.110
Dipinto, Matt: See, that's my fingerprint. Mine is failing with single quotes.

58
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.970
Dipinto, Matt: What python are you in?

59
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.320
Anthony Taylor: Oh, she's a 5 same as me.

60
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.819
Baro, Sonja: She's in the same. You have the same same problem, Matt.

61
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.119
Dipinto, Matt: I do. I do. And we tried 17 different ways to make it work, and it told us, now

62
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.299
Baro, Sonja: it's just no, it's a hard no, I think, is what I said to my group. It's just like, No.

63
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.260
Baro, Sonja: sometimes you just get an O,

64
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.449
Anthony Taylor: alright! Do me one more favor. Go all the way to the top.

65
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.970
Anthony Taylor: Recreate this data frame right here.

66
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.340
Anthony Taylor: Just run that cell right there that cell.

67
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.030
Baro, Sonja: gotcha 1 s.

68
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.150
Anthony Taylor: and now go all the way back, down

69
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.760
Anthony Taylor: and run the last

70
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.990
Anthony Taylor: scroll down just a little bit slowly. No, I wanna read all that stuff. So

71
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.450
Anthony Taylor: I know I don't tell you guys to read this stuff, but that's because I don't expect you to.

72
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:20.270
Anthony Taylor: Huh!

73
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.460
Anthony Taylor: But when you scroll to the right on that error message go all the way down

74
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.700
Anthony Taylor: there you go. Thanks.

75
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.240
Dipinto, Matt: So I changed my kernel to 310, and it said, That's great. And did it

76
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.160
Anthony Taylor: really

77
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:40.840
Anthony Taylor: non monotonic date, non monotonic date time. And that's such a good

78
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:49.110
Anthony Taylor: error message slicing on non monotonic.

79
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.939
Anthony Taylor: I don't even think I can spell that error messages.

80
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.190
Anthony Taylor: pandas

81
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.499
Baro, Sonja: cisco, Matt. We can be non monotonic

82
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:07.650
Baro, Sonja: students for the night, not monotonic losers.

83
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.850
Baro, Sonja: It's probably something to do with the index, you know. One more thing I want you to show me before you go away.

84
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:18.859
Anthony Taylor: Or did you already? No, okay. Scroll. Scroll up

85
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:22.389
Anthony Taylor: and let me see the table at that where we made it at the top.

86
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.330
Clayton Graves: Your mom's non-monotonic.

87
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.140
Anthony Taylor: My God.

88
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.059
Anthony Taylor: okay,

89
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:41.939
Anthony Taylor: you know what, Clayton. That reminds me of one of my favorite jokes that it's not even. It's not really a joke. But it was the funniest thing a student said until now. So hold on.

90
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.380
Anthony Taylor: Yes, Meredith, how can I help you?

91
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:54.090
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yup? So when yesterday we talked a little bit about when they use the terminology. Slice the data.

92
00:07:54.110 --> 00:08:00.609
Meredith McCanse (she/her): You had said that usually that means like they're telling you to like, call it as a variable.

93
00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:04.989
Meredith McCanse (she/her): or name it as a variable is that when they say, slice it.

94
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.350
Meredith McCanse (she/her): yeah.

95
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:18.900
Anthony Taylor: or slicing a data frame, I guess this is maybe not slicing it, but it's still a data frame, really no other way to do this. Besides the filter, right? There's no way to.

96
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:34.139
Meredith McCanse (she/her): because the example we had yesterday we like we specified a specific column, so we kind of like renamed it. We gave it a new name, and just called the column, but with something like this with a date range. You can't do it that way right? You have to use a filter correct.

97
00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:47.750
Anthony Taylor: correct? Well, I mean, this is the index. So you can do, but it's still the same thing in the background. The exact same thing is happening is if you did log and then date equals blah, blah blah or date in

98
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.660
Anthony Taylor: blah blah. Blah, right? So yeah.

99
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:56.109
Anthony Taylor: I don't think that's anything about you. Now, if you wanted to stay, you have to assign it to a variable.

100
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:57.600
Anthony Taylor: Maybe that's what you mean.

101
00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:05.770
Dipinto, Matt: Apparently non monotonic means that it's not in consecutive order. And if you do a sort.

102
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.429
Dipinto, Matt: yeah, if you do a sort index. It works again.

103
00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:13.300
Anthony Taylor: Did we do a sort up here? I doubt we did, but that makes sense

104
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:20.809
Anthony Taylor: non-monotonic. I'm going to use that word in a sentence. Just don't know web sentence.

105
00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.840
Raugewitz, Tania: Clayton has an example literally just did.

106
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.779
Baro, Sonja: Oh, don't use that non monotonic voice with me.

107
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:32.409
Baro, Sonja: Oh, that's good! I can say my voice is very non monotonic.

108
00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:43.339
Anthony Taylor: Somebody said that to me today they said, everything stays. Sounds like you're like cheering. I'm like, that's not true.

109
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:49.120
Anthony Taylor: anyway. Alright!

110
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:56.879
Anthony Taylor: Alright! Are we ready? We got it. Thank you, Matt, for Googling, that I, or whatever you did, to get that great job.

111
00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.269
Anthony Taylor: Fancy Googling, he's a good googler, that man.

112
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:02.650
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So

113
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:08.850
Anthony Taylor: it's I gotta tell you. And and if you're watching Nick.

114
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:15.470
Anthony Taylor: the Fintech curriculum is ridiculously easy. and my students love it.

115
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.110
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

116
00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:27.430
Anthony Taylor:  we're gonna start the next exercise now.  it's so easy. I might even like

117
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:33.049
Anthony Taylor: do some live coding. I know I know I've lost my mind.

118
00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:35.969
Anthony Taylor: But why not right? We can do it.

119
00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:43.719
Anthony Taylor:  So correlations. So we talked about correlations already. So this isn't new.

120
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.549
Anthony Taylor: We've gone through this before.

121
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.149
Anthony Taylor: But now we're gonna look at correlations with

122
00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.359
Anthony Taylor: time series date.

123
00:10:53.460 --> 00:11:00.079
Anthony Taylor: That's it. Okay? So here's the whole. Actually, this one silly, I should do this one because I told you I was gonna do this one.

124
00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:06.030
Anthony Taylor: But here we're bringing in home sales data. The index is our period end date.

125
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.400
Anthony Taylor: Honestly.

126
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:12.769
Anthony Taylor: yeah. Oh, there it is. I was. Gonna say honestly.

127
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:22.519
Anthony Taylor: the fact that that last one didn't have the index or didn't sort is kind of interesting anytime. You're working with time series data. You probably want to do a sort of the index.

128
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:36.719
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Because if it wasn't given to you already sorted your that. I didn't even know about that monotonic error. But it'll give you issues with plotting or a whole bunch of other stuff. So

129
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:39.000
Anthony Taylor: let's just get into the practice

130
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.869
Anthony Taylor: of sorting. Our

131
00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.520
Anthony Taylor: are goodies. Okay?

132
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:48.300
Anthony Taylor: So now we're sorted, everything is awesome.

133
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:55.620
Anthony Taylor: So now we're just going to do a plot. And this is the plot we've seen before. So we're gonna say, df, home sales.

134
00:11:55.670 --> 00:12:00.169
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna do bracket bracket because there's 2 columns inventory

135
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:06.710
Anthony Taylor: and homes sold. Remember, we talked about this yesterday.

136
00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:13.320
Anthony Taylor: Now, when I said it yesterday. I actually didn't say it right.

137
00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:19.490
Anthony Taylor: But let's look at it and see. So when we're talking about correlations.

138
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:22.460
Anthony Taylor: Is there correlation?

139
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:27.790
Dipinto, Matt: There's an inverse correlation.

140
00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:37.100
Anthony Taylor: an inverse correlation. See? Matt's being very specific. And he's absolutely right. So if we actually look at this and calculate

141
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:48.110
Anthony Taylor: the correlation. Okay? So we're going to pass in the same information. But this time we're gonna say, give me not the F home sales also.

142
00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:58.300
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna say, instead of plop, we're gonna tell it to give us the core. that function there. Now, notice, look at these numbers. What did I say.

143
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:06.730
Anthony Taylor: is a good correlation, either a one or a negative one. Right? This is about as non correlated as you could be.

144
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:10.829
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So why.

145
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:14.960
Anthony Taylor: Anthony, you said they were correlated. Well, they are correlated inversion.

146
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:22.559
Anthony Taylor: One's going down while one's going up. That's exactly the opposite of our statistical definition of correlation.

147
00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:27.030
Anthony Taylor: Okay, one that we've been using is they? They move

148
00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:34.670
Anthony Taylor: together. These are kind of moving together, but not really all right. They're doing it differently. Ones going up ones go down.

149
00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.970
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So

150
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:43.300
Anthony Taylor: from a correlation standpoint in this class.

151
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.700
Anthony Taylor: while there's a type of correlation, it is not the one we're looking for.

152
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:54.219
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we want when X is affected, y is affected, and it can be negative.

153
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:55.790
Baro, Sonja: Alright.

154
00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:03.510
Baro, Sonja: Anthony, I mean, when X goes down, y went up. So it's just

155
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.060
Anthony Taylor: well.

156
00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:16.800
Anthony Taylor: yeah, I mean it. It's but it is an inverse thing. Right? Yeah, we can't. We can have a negative. We can have a Y

157
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:20.230
Anthony Taylor: going downward. That's just a negative correlation.

158
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:25.580
Baro, Sonja: But this is not negative. This is literally

159
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:30.870
Anthony Taylor: nothing wrong with it. It's still, in effect, I just want you to know

160
00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:34.530
Anthony Taylor: that correlation is looking at

161
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:39.910
Anthony Taylor: all positive, all negative. It's not looking at image. It won't calculate that

162
00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:43.489
Anthony Taylor: which is another reason why

163
00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:51.390
Anthony Taylor: we we need to look at the data. We can't just count on that stuff. Alright. believe it or not.

164
00:14:55.830 --> 00:15:00.990
Anthony Taylor: They want you to do an exercise with that. Alright

165
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:07.619
Anthony Taylor: I think we're gonna do this one together, though.

166
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.380
Anthony Taylor: because I remember this when

167
00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:19.390
Anthony Taylor: yeah, the next ones are not too hard. But this one, is it? It gets you again in all kinds of areas that you've never been in.

168
00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.030
Anthony Taylor: I think this is the one

169
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:25.210
Anthony Taylor:  I know. One of them is like that. It's like

170
00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.320
Anthony Taylor: what?

171
00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.360
Aye!

172
00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:36.140
Anthony Taylor: Oh, but you know what? Before we do that, there's some good slides on this. So let's go look at our slides. They gave us good slides. Let's look at it.

173
00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:44.199
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So Panda's library. We know we have the core method that will help us determine if there's a correlation. Okay?

174
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:58.029
Anthony Taylor:  with time series correlations can come in all States infections. In fact, there can be many things that change the patterns or or affect the patterns of our data.

175
00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:07.539
Anthony Taylor: One seasonal. Okay, we know for a fact. There are some things that do better at different times. Year.

176
00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.250
Anthony Taylor: Okay, tourism.

177
00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:17.520
Anthony Taylor: That's a big one. right? Stopping. That's a great one.

178
00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:19.900
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

179
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:21.810
Anthony Taylor: you know.

180
00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:25.630
Anthony Taylor: Hot dogs.

181
00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.710
Anthony Taylor:  is that seasonal?

182
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.350
Anthony Taylor: Everybody agree that hot dogs might be diesel.

183
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:40.160
Anthony Taylor: Absolutely right. There's different times when people buy more hot dogs.

184
00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:43.220
Anthony Taylor: Okay, tailgators buy hotdogs.

185
00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:56.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But there are times when they buy those. So anyway, the point is is, while it doesn't matter if we can identify an actual one. When you get your data, it could be affected by seasonal

186
00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:04.080
Anthony Taylor: so when we look at correlations, we have an observed correlation where we could simply look at all of the data

187
00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:08.390
Anthony Taylor: and say, Well, look you there, something happened at that time. Period.

188
00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:17.000
Anthony Taylor: Okay, something happened on September eleventh that caused everything did crash. Okay.

189
00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.480
Anthony Taylor: yep, that's definitely

190
00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:26.349
Anthony Taylor: you know, a correlation. Something happened. a trend we're looking at over time.

191
00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:34.829
Anthony Taylor: larger time. This is typically your seasonals, and I know seasonals right there. But this is typically going to be like seasonal or

192
00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:39.089
Anthony Taylor: a president or a war.

193
00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:45.780
Anthony Taylor: Big things. Okay, seasonal is very, very consistent

194
00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:47.900
Anthony Taylor: across 4 seasons.

195
00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:52.500
Anthony Taylor: Alright. It doesn't mean that they're this clean. This is like ridiculous. This is.

196
00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:55.390
Anthony Taylor: this is ludicrous. Okay, this chart.

197
00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:02.729
Anthony Taylor: But the point is is that you will see a distinct difference in the 4 seasons, and sometimes they overlap.

198
00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:06.800
Anthony Taylor: I mean, let's be honest. Spring, summer fall in some States is the same thing.

199
00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.559
Anthony Taylor: Okay, not in Colorado. I know you guys have pretty seasons

200
00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:17.660
Anthony Taylor: alright down here in San Antonio. We've got hot. We've got cool, that's it.

201
00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:23.970
Anthony Taylor: 2 seasons. Okay?  yeah. So

202
00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.500
Anthony Taylor: right now, we're in the warm.

203
00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.750
Anthony Taylor: not quite cool.

204
00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:34.779
Anthony Taylor:  yeah. And then residual. This is like, the really, you know. Maybe there is. Maybe there's not. It's hard to.

205
00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.380
Anthony Taylor: Okay. That was it really?

206
00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:52.780
Anthony Taylor:  so in statistics, a correlation defines relationship between 2 or more variables which goes back to what we were just showing right? Well, wasn't that no sort of so strong positives, weak, negative, strong, negative, weak, positive.

207
00:18:52.850 --> 00:19:03.860
Anthony Taylor: not a negative. No way in heck. Correlation would be helpful, but if they don't provide it up so this is a very important statement, because I make a big deal out of correlations.

208
00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:12.180
Anthony Taylor: I love correlations in the Ml. Space, but everyone's heard. Oh, correlation does all make causation, of course.

209
00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:23.229
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And and and we'll say that one time, because you probably all heard it just because they're correlated doesn't mean that one is directly affecting the other. It can be coincidence.

210
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.170
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

211
00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.700
Anthony Taylor: There you go. Correlation does not imply causation.

212
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:31.719
Anthony Taylor: There you go. Never have to say that again.

213
00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:36.560
Anthony Taylor: How many? How many of you've heard that before, just out of curiosity.

214
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:43.610
Anthony Taylor: Is anyone never heard that state ever like in your life? You're like, No, okay.

215
00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:52.690
Anthony Taylor: alright. Since correlation evaluates how much 2 variables move together. They work really well with stops.

216
00:19:52.930 --> 00:20:04.179
Anthony Taylor: As we can look at time, we can see how much the stock is moving over time, and we can start to calculate. So consider this heat map, which is funny. They don't actually show you how to make a heat map. I did.

217
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:05.980
Anthony Taylor: But

218
00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:13.749
Anthony Taylor: what can you identify which stock tends to move together most strong. Just looking at this.

219
00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.779
Anthony Taylor: this is some data analytics here

220
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.730
Baro, Sonja: the dark blues right?

221
00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:26.769
Anthony Taylor: The darker blue is is a higher correlation. Yes.

222
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:32.590
Baro, Sonja: so like, for instance, Crs and Amrc.

223
00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.930
Baro, Sonja: C. Rs, Dcph.

224
00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.660
Anthony Taylor: DC. Ph.

225
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:48.699
Baro, Sonja: On the horizontal horizontal on the horizontal. Dcph, there crs there yeah, that one's pretty good, too.

226
00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:51.350
Anthony Taylor: And there's also Crs, then bbj, p.

227
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:52.220
yeah.

228
00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay, those are the 2 darkest

229
00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:59.720
Clayton Graves: DBTH. Wherever those are.

230
00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:03.710
Anthony Taylor: Bb, tth, and Dcph.

231
00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.470
Anthony Taylor: this one

232
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.760
Anthony Taylor: DC. Ph. Moves with a lot of these. Huh?

233
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:11.509
Anthony Taylor: It's kind of crazy.

234
00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:18.749
Anthony Taylor: but they're both heavy manufacturing industry. So it kind of makes sense right? If we look at what these these stocks are.

235
00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:27.150
Anthony Taylor: they? They're both manufacturing. So yeah, manufacturing.

236
00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:30.599
Anthony Taylor: Those are all good ones.

237
00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:39.580
Anthony Taylor: So you will use correlations like identify relationships between current observations and future values. This differs

238
00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:46.579
Anthony Taylor: from identifying relationships or variables that are measured at the same time. Alright. And that's where we're gonna get into

239
00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:49.429
with this next activity, which is

240
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:54.040
Anthony Taylor: like, I said, it's not what we covered in the

241
00:21:54.440 --> 00:22:04.320
Anthony Taylor: in the instructor Demo, which is why I wanted to do this one with you. Alright. So let's do that. We're gonna do activity 3

242
00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:08.340
Anthony Taylor: unsolved. Everybody get there.

243
00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.649
Anthony Taylor: Let's make this happen.

244
00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:21.010
Anthony Taylor: How to do alright. So we're gonna import our libraries.

245
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:27.339
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna do our our state get our index dates. Let's just date and close. There's not a whole lot to.

246
00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:31.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay. but there's another file.

247
00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.339
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we're gonna bring in trends. So this is apple

248
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.609
Anthony Taylor: prices. And this is Google trends

249
00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:50.689
Anthony Taylor: on apple product on Apple's company. Alright. So Google keeps track of everybody. And what's being

250
00:22:51.120 --> 00:23:02.699
Anthony Taylor:  Queried about those and requested about those? Okay. Now, one of the things I kind of had fun with this in the solution. I'm going to give you guys. I actually

251
00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:09.880
Anthony Taylor: go through this with both concat and merge alright cause. I know there was a lot of excitement back when we did that

252
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:14.409
Anthony Taylor:  and they they actually, I learned something.

253
00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:16.650
Anthony Taylor: Be honest with you didn't even know

254
00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:20.930
Anthony Taylor:  It turns out that

255
00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.470
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to show you, because if I try to explain it, I'll mess it up.

256
00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.410
Anthony Taylor: So

257
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:36.450
Anthony Taylor: here's kin cat. And here's merge. Okay, this is exactly the same output.

258
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:42.430
Anthony Taylor: With one exception. This first one is concat

259
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:44.910
Anthony Taylor: Flo.

260
00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:48.790
Anthony Taylor: Second, one is merge.

261
00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:50.950
Anthony Taylor: integer flow.

262
00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:54.620
Anthony Taylor: Anybody want? Guess why?

263
00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:02.500
Anthony Taylor: No.

264
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:13.010
Anthony Taylor: I give it to you, I'll just take take you out of your misery. Merge is actually taking 2 data frames and combining them on a key.

265
00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:15.160
Anthony Taylor: Okay, while concat

266
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:23.320
Anthony Taylor: is combining them on an index, but it's using numpy in the background, and numpy prefers floats.

267
00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:28.280
Anthony Taylor: So when at all possible, it will convert the output to floats.

268
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:34.560
Anthony Taylor: I know it took me forever to find out why it was doing that. I probably spent an hour looking at this

269
00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:39.850
Anthony Taylor: like Doug got it? Why is it doing this because somebody is going to ask. probably men.

270
00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:43.810
Anthony Taylor: So I changed my mind, and I figured it out

271
00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.570
Anthony Taylor: alright. So anyway.

272
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:54.149
Anthony Taylor:  So we're just going to do a concat here. and we're gonna concaten the 2 tables.

273
00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.290
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to drop all our nodes.

274
00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:59.720
Anthony Taylor: We are gonna concat on

275
00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.710
Anthony Taylor: axis one

276
00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.399
Anthony Taylor: and drop in a

277
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:06.240
Anthony Taylor: okay.

278
00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:13.910
Anthony Taylor: and I'll tell you the reason we're doing this is as much for this exercise. But the tool we're about to learn to use

279
00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:18.400
Anthony Taylor: tomorrow or Monday. But we're gonna prep for today.

280
00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:21.830
Anthony Taylor: is it does not like moles at all.

281
00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:23.520
Anthony Taylor: So

282
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:38.509
Anthony Taylor: yeah, so we're going to get used to that again. So here we go. We've concatenated. So now we have the close and the trend worldwide right next to each other, which is really cool, for when we use our plots.

283
00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:44.240
Anthony Taylor: Don't worry about this instruction. This instruction is no longer necessary.

284
00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:47.920
Anthony Taylor: Just do plot.

285
00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:49.819
Anthony Taylor: and you will get what you want.

286
00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:55.320
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so the blue line is how the stock actually closed

287
00:25:55.810 --> 00:26:01.180
Anthony Taylor: the orange line is the Google searching trends.

288
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:08.490
Anthony Taylor: So you can see. Oh, there's a little peak we go up. There's Little Peak, and we go up. There's little Peak, and we went down.

289
00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:12.549
Anthony Taylor: There's a big peak, and we went up

290
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:18.019
Anthony Taylor: alright. So there's there's something there, in my opinion.

291
00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:23.270
Anthony Taylor: Okay, the thing that doesn't show very well with transfer. What?

292
00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:27.950
Anthony Taylor: Actually, you guys tell me. looking at this. what?

293
00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:34.580
Anthony Taylor: How do you feel using trends to determine if the stocks gonna go up. Does it make you feel warm and fuzzy?

294
00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.060
Anthony Taylor: How do you feel about

295
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:45.130
Mason, Natalie: it? Doesn't seem like it would be

296
00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:48.240
Mason, Natalie: correlated in the long run.

297
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:57.450
Anthony Taylor: II would not argue that point at all. But what? Why, I mean, I just showed you that it seems like after each peak you see a steady rise.

298
00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:00.200
Anthony Taylor: but there's a correlation order.

299
00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:02.030
Anthony Taylor: Sorry, Lynn

300
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:04.330
michael mcpherson: Fiscal reporting third quarter.

301
00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:15.630
michael mcpherson: Look at the time of the Google the the trends. Third quarter.

302
00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:20.610
Anthony Taylor: But again, there's something else about this chart that I'm noticing.

303
00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:24.759
Anthony Taylor: and I'm going. Oh, yeah, I don't know if that's a good correlation.

304
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:29.459
Clayton Graves: Well, there. There are 2 different kinds of patterns here, right? There's

305
00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:35.200
Clayton Graves: one that shows a trend, the other one looks more seasonal.

306
00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:42.540
Anthony Taylor: I think. Well, and it kind is like, like, Mike pointed out. That's probably third quarter reporting that we're seeing the P.

307
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:48.739
Anthony Taylor: But how about this? If it was correlated when you the trends dropped.

308
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:56.689
Anthony Taylor: See how they're always dropping way down here, way down here, way down here, way down here. Then you would assume that stock would drop.

309
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:58.350
Anthony Taylor: But it's not

310
00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:04.990
Anthony Taylor: right, so you can't count, just because it appears that the peaks are before arise

311
00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:06.859
Anthony Taylor: right? The fact that

312
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:11.389
Anthony Taylor: the the valleys are not for a dip. That means they're really not cork

313
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:16.120
Anthony Taylor: alright. Now we'll find out. Cause that's just my qualitative

314
00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:17.750
Anthony Taylor: observation.

315
00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:20.800
Anthony Taylor: It's not mathematic. We're going to get there.

316
00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:21.970
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

317
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:29.000
Baro, Sonja: Anthony, can you? That's okay. I'm just seeing go up one more.

318
00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.719
Baro, Sonja: So you did the plot. Okay.

319
00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.310
yeah.

320
00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:39.970
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So oh, no. Did you have questions, Sonya? Sorry.

321
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:45.389
Baro, Sonja: No, I'm just having weird results again, but keep going. Keep going.

322
00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:53.859
Anthony Taylor: So on September tenth, 2,019 apple organizes that were presented. New iphone 11 families. The Apple Watch Series 5 and a new ipad

323
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:58.270
Anthony Taylor: gained worldwide attention. But we could probably see that on here.

324
00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.790
Anthony Taylor: I guess it's this one. Okay.

325
00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:09.920
Anthony Taylor: September tenth. No, it's probably this one. this big giant one right there. Okay.

326
00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:20.539
Anthony Taylor: so let's closely examine that range. So here we are. We're going to. We're going to spotlight.

327
00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.840
Anthony Taylor: We'll even call it spotlight.

328
00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:27.420
Anthony Taylor: and we're going to look at Df apple

329
00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.080
Anthony Taylor: dot log

330
00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:42.719
Anthony Taylor: brackets, and then you just could put in that range that they set up above. So we're gonna say, 2,019. Dash 3 dash O 10, this one's not the hard. Oh, well.

331
00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:51.050
Anthony Taylor: maybe we'll do a couple. Everyone do today which really gonna get us out of  2,020

332
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:54.590
Anthony Taylor: dash O, one dash 3, one.

333
00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:58.389
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so there we have our

334
00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:02.410
Anthony Taylor: slice.

335
00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.229
Anthony Taylor: And it looks basically like this. It's still pretty big.

336
00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:16.750
Anthony Taylor: right? So we can still do a plot of this. No big deal. We can see what it looks like. So we can say the

337
00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.279
underscore spotlight plot.

338
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:25.299
Anthony Taylor: And you get something like this. So here we see that trend went back.

339
00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:30.679
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But and and we do see a riot.

340
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:34.080
Anthony Taylor: Was it because of the trend? I don't know about that.

341
00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:40.189
Anthony Taylor: but we do see a spike and then a rise. But to be honest with you, this thing looks like it's been rising the whole time.

342
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:42.210
Anthony Taylor: regardless of the trend.

343
00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:55.220
Anthony Taylor: But before we do that. okay, we're gonna have some. Oh, this is the part that yeah, they didn't even come close to telling about alright. So we're gonna use a new function called fifths.

344
00:30:56.190 --> 00:31:02.940
Anthony Taylor: What shift does is it's going to allow us to take the value from one column.

345
00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:08.630
Anthony Taylor: one row and move it to another row.

346
00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:16.509
Anthony Taylor: What would be the value of that. Well, I want to take today's value, and I want to put it next to tomorrow's value.

347
00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:23.840
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Now, there's a lot of ways to do that. But shift makes it really easy.

348
00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.649
Anthony Taylor: The other thing we're gonna do. Once we do that, we could do percent change.

349
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:35.439
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And we can do it over a rolling window, which I'll explain. Alright. But first, well.

350
00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:39.449
Anthony Taylor: yeah, first, let's let's do our shift.

351
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:42.059
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we're going to say, Df.

352
00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:48.550
Anthony Taylor: and we're gonna make a new column. Call up sorry ef underscore apple

353
00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:52.480
Anthony Taylor: make a new column called Lagged

354
00:31:53.940 --> 00:32:03.270
Anthony Taylor: Friends. Okay. Now, guys, this is a really useful way to do some a lot of data

355
00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:19.630
Anthony Taylor: analysis when you want to compare cause. I mean, you could technically do. And and I know we don't talk about sequel like a correlated sequel where you like. Oh, I'm gonna join this. Join that. Do that. It's still very complicated to do it. This is a really simple way to do it.

356
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:23.149
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to say, Trend worldwide.

357
00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:26.960
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And I'm going to shift it

358
00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:29.020
Anthony Taylor: by what?

359
00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:33.790
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So let's go ahead and look at ef apple after we do that.

360
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:38.190
Anthony Taylor: So now we have this new column. Why is the first one null?

361
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:51.740
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Because they're shifted so there's no there. It doesn't have any value, because it was before the start of the data pushed it down by one row, one row.

362
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:53.600
Anthony Taylor: So the first one is blank

363
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:59.929
Anthony Taylor: nothing before. The first one is the first one. So this 32 is now here.

364
00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:04.279
Anthony Taylor: this 33 is here. Everybody see what shift does.

365
00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:07.239
Anthony Taylor: If we would have said, Shift 2. It would've pushed them down, too.

366
00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:09.390
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

367
00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:11.760
Anthony Taylor: all right.

368
00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:16.100
Anthony Taylor: So that's what shift does. So now that we have shifts.

369
00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:20.860
Anthony Taylor: We're going to also do a percent change. Now.

370
00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:23.529
Anthony Taylor: technically, you don't need shift to do a percent change.

371
00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:27.369
Anthony Taylor: But we're gonna run a method called percent change.

372
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:31.909
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna create a new column for this. It's gonna be called weekly

373
00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:34.180
Anthony Taylor: returns.

374
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:37.959
Anthony Taylor: And this will equal

375
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:43.059
Anthony Taylor: Df apple. We're going to use the close column.

376
00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:47.009
Anthony Taylor: which is our value column. And we're going to say, percent

377
00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:48.740
Anthony Taylor: change.

378
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:53.219
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And again, let's take a look at our data when we're done.

379
00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:57.810
Anthony Taylor: So now we have this close.

380
00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:03.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And what it's calculating is the percent change from the previous row.

381
00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.669
Anthony Taylor: Does everybody see that

382
00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.230
Anthony Taylor: percent change for the previous row?

383
00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:17.099
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And I don't know exactly how that math works out, but that's how it works out.

384
00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:29.800
Anthony Taylor:  okay. So continuing now, we're going to do. And this is a really cool. So now we're gonna do weekly volatility.

385
00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.870
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna do df, apple. we're going to create a column called

386
00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:37.870
Anthony Taylor: Volatility is in a yeah.

387
00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:44.040
Anthony Taylor: and we're going to use what's called a rolling window.

388
00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:45.820
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

389
00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:49.300
Anthony Taylor:  so we're going to use the closed column

390
00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:53.739
Anthony Taylor: again. And we're gonna say, percent chain.

391
00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:57.949
Anthony Taylor: But instead of doing it for just the previous.

392
00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.469
Anthony Taylor: whatever. Aye, aye.

393
00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:08.950
Anthony Taylor: I will get it, I promise. There we go! We're gonna actually tell it to skip

394
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:14.950
Anthony Taylor: and do like 4 at a time. Okay, so we're gonna say, window

395
00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:19.530
Anthony Taylor: equals 4. This is a very advanced

396
00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:23.419
Anthony Taylor: concept. And we do this a bit

397
00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:27.160
Anthony Taylor: when you're doing some pretty heavy data analysis.

398
00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:30.690
Anthony Taylor: There are a lot of ways to do this. And most

399
00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:35.050
Anthony Taylor: visualization tools have these kind of functions built in.

400
00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:38.500
Anthony Taylor: But now, as you can see.

401
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:46.280
Anthony Taylor: see what we've done here. So these are weeks so effectively, we've said, let's roll up by month.

402
00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:57.949
Anthony Taylor: Got it. Basically, I mean, I know not all months or 4 weeks. But we're basically taking these 4, bringing it down and then calculating the difference.

403
00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:04.520
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Which. Again, I don't see how 32 and 31 is the difference. But

404
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:12.730
Anthony Taylor: that's that's kind of weird, I think there must be. Oh. because I'm looking at the wrong one Duh. 29.7 and 29.8

405
00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:17.979
Meredith McCanse (she/her): up a little bit and show the code again for how you did it.

406
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:30.419
Anthony Taylor: Yes, see? Yeah, you're gonna understand now. And I say that not since Meredith is particularly a genius because she is. but because in a finance thing they look at stuff like this a lot

407
00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:31.800
Anthony Taylor: and a finance rule.

408
00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:40.410
Anthony Taylor: So like, I said, this lesson plan this whole week is from Fintech. So it's very financially ish.

409
00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:44.879
Anthony Taylor: okay? It's a very cool thing. And I'm

410
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:57.340
Baro, Sonja: yeah. Can you can you spend a minute and talk more about the not so much the code, but the theory behind this. So like we're we're comparing the shift. Says we're going to move

411
00:36:57.610 --> 00:37:04.920
Baro, Sonja: one time period value to push it down by whatever we want it to be

412
00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:15.819
Anthony Taylor: to do what to think, those to expose. Well, right now we're trying, I mean. So in this case for Gif, you're simply trying to see the trends by week. Because, remember, this is a week.

413
00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:27.659
Anthony Taylor: Right? Right? So when we do shift, I mean, all we're doing is prep in the data. Okay, to be able to do this kind of stuff. And then we're gonna look at percent change of close

414
00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:31.890
Anthony Taylor: which I don't know that it really depends on shift. Hold on. Let me

415
00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:37.350
Anthony Taylor: let me fair. Let me check that cause. I don't want to say that and be completely off on that.

416
00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:47.310
Anthony Taylor: I think shift was just to show you you could do it because it's similar to percent change the way it works. But you make sure

417
00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:50.510
to.

418
00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:51.719
Anthony Taylor: I figured.

419
00:37:57.150 --> 00:38:01.909
Baro, Sonja: yeah, I'm just curious to see, to understand the of the

420
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:04.850
Baro, Sonja: code to what's there to show you.

421
00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:09.109
Anthony Taylor: So so yeah, so so shift in this particular situation is doing nothing.

422
00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:22.970
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's simply to demonstrate that you can do what it did. Alright. So you can say, Hey, move down one. Now, when we get to percent change, notice, it's got the same behavior.

423
00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:26.609
Anthony Taylor: Why? Because it's looking at the difference between here and here.

424
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.160
Baro, Sonja: even though

425
00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:32.200
Anthony Taylor: it it is sorry

426
00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:44.520
Baro, Sonja: I was. Gonna say, the percent change is because we've shifted or can, because it's gotta have something. The percent change between this value and that, regardless. If we had shifted or not

427
00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:53.000
Anthony Taylor: exactly, we could take no difference all they were trying to show you. If you could do this and percent change does something very similar.

428
00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:55.010
Baro, Sonja: Gotcha

429
00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.710
Anthony Taylor: Meredith. I'm muted, too, so I know.

430
00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:06.909
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I just had a question about what are we? Can you show the code, the code down at the bottom of your screen again, where we're doing the rolling window.

431
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:17.059
Anthony Taylor: So the role so the window equals 4 is that basically just telling it 4 rows of data.

432
00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:23.770
Anthony Taylor: right? And it's getting us, the percent change between this value and this value

433
00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.950
Anthony Taylor: instead of this value in this.

434
00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:39.350
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay? But then we did standard deviation at the end of that. So is that actually a standard deviation value as opposed to a percent change value in that column. Std is a standard deviation. I'm Gonna check hold on.

435
00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:41.260
Anthony Taylor: I would think it is.

436
00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:47.130
Anthony Taylor: But let's do this. They don't explain why they did that.

437
00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:50.410
Anthony Taylor: and I don't know that it's necessary. So let's find out.

438
00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:01.110
Anthony Taylor: Yes.

439
00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:08.920
Anthony Taylor: calculate all. It is the standard deviation of the percentage change in closing price overly. Window 4 periods.

440
00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:15.350
Anthony Taylor: you are correct, is the standard deviation. Now, we might decided to do that because we wanted it to be positive.

441
00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:18.489
Anthony Taylor: right? That could be it.

442
00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:20.790
Anthony Taylor: So I'm not sure why they want

443
00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:30.690
Anthony Taylor: you're gonna see? We're gonna do a correlation across all of these values. So whoever came up with this exercise decided they wanted to use standard deviation.

444
00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.080
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I don't know exactly why

445
00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:40.180
Vasquez, Gabriel: in that explanation. It does tell you why the why, what the numbers mean.

446
00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:54.170
Vasquez, Gabriel: Yeah, it said, a low, it says, explains what low numbers and high numbers. That part. I think we're okay on

447
00:40:54.570 --> 00:41:03.599
Anthony Taylor: but yeah, here, let's let's go through that. In the context of stock prices. A low standard deviation indicates that the price tend to be close to the mean of the set.

448
00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:05.999
Anthony Taylor: while a high indicates that it's

449
00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:14.969
Anthony Taylor: basically it means it's it's moved farther away from the middle. Okay? So no, that's good. No, I'm I'm I'm wondering why

450
00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:27.939
Anthony Taylor: you know what. Let's finish this. Maybe maybe we'll figure it out before it's over. I'm trying to get rid of that copilot. I don't know. I don't know how to get rid of it. There we go.

451
00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:31.909
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so let's continue this

452
00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:42.129
Anthony Taylor:  confirm all columns. Alright, we already displayed it. We don't need that. So here we're gonna use the correlation function

453
00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:46.970
Anthony Taylor:  to correlates

454
00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:50.819
Anthony Taylor: all 3 of our new columns. And

455
00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:57.409
Anthony Taylor: II, you know. And maybe this is why they did this with Lag, with with, okay.

456
00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.470
Anthony Taylor: now I can see a reason why they might have done this.

457
00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:10.079
Anthony Taylor: So now let's go back to this because they're gonna have us use this flag, Brandon correlation. So let me let you know what. Let me draw. Let me write the correlation function.

458
00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:14.290
Anthony Taylor: and then we'll go back and talk about. Now I understand why they did that.

459
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:18.400
So lag friends.

460
00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:24.580
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And weekly returns

461
00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:31.220
Anthony Taylor: and weekly volatility.

462
00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:35.149
Clayton Graves: Watch your spelling and weekly returns.

463
00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:40.530
Anthony Taylor: Did I do that wrong in there, too? That's that's spelled out returns.

464
00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:47.190
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then here we're gonna do dot or okay. Now.

465
00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:50.579
Anthony Taylor: now I understand why we showed you the lack the shift.

466
00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:52.090
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

467
00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:59.739
Anthony Taylor: If we would have done correlation between this and these, it would have caused us a problem.

468
00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:03.130
Anthony Taylor: right? Cause. These aren't all about

469
00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:08.879
Anthony Taylor: by doing the shift. We are correlating this and this.

470
00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:14.589
Anthony Taylor: this and this. So it it makes more sense when we try to do the correlation calculation.

471
00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:20.959
Anthony Taylor: But when we do the roller window we're gonna add more bells. Anyway. I don't think it's gonna matter, because what you're gonna see

472
00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:26.539
Anthony Taylor: did anything correlate?

473
00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:32.130
Anthony Taylor: No.

474
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:38.939
Anthony Taylor: it's funny in the in the notes, they say, well, there's a slight correlation. But it's not very strong. And I'm like

475
00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:44.430
Anthony Taylor: they're talking about this value

476
00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:47.730
Anthony Taylor: like they're nuts. Okay.

477
00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.400
Anthony Taylor: But

478
00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:54.229
Anthony Taylor: yeah, so the reason we showed you shift

479
00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:58.040
Anthony Taylor: was simply to get this value and this value on the thing.

480
00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:05.330
Anthony Taylor: I it's still good to know, cause I use shift in a number of scenarios.

481
00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:08.539
Anthony Taylor: You know where Clayton shift is really cool

482
00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:09.900
Anthony Taylor: logs.

483
00:44:12.370 --> 00:44:16.480
Anthony Taylor: right? Being able to do logs, percent change

484
00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:18.590
Anthony Taylor: being unlocked because log

485
00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:25.820
Anthony Taylor: Clayton knows about machine logs and server logs. Okay, which you get a whole bunch of like readings.

486
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:29.589
Anthony Taylor: And and they could be every second. They could be every minute they could be every hour.

487
00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:34.759
Anthony Taylor: But let's say they're every minute, and you have 10 days of readings, and you need to chart

488
00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:44.380
Anthony Taylor: how these things are working, or or you need to like flag when things are changing, etc. These 2 things I just showed you freaking awesome for that.

489
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:52.370
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you could do lag. And then you could just calculate across, or you could do percent change and just get it from there.

490
00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:53.970
Anthony Taylor: Very cool.

491
00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:58.599
Clayton Graves: Okay, well, I could do this to

492
00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:04.059
Clayton Graves: to to spot trends and network performance, or something like that.

493
00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:08.230
Anthony Taylor: absolutely. absolutely

494
00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:15.599
Anthony Taylor: alright. So let's go back to view what we learned that was new there cause now, all I need was new. Was those 3 things

495
00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:23.599
Anthony Taylor: shift. Everybody understand what shift does, whether or not you understand why you need it. You understand what it does. Is that a question click.

496
00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:27.440
Anthony Taylor: Oh, you're okay. Yeah, okay, you're visually demonstrating

497
00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:39.229
Anthony Taylor: percent change this one. I think we could probably find more useful. But does everybody understand? When you do percent change, it's showing you the current row

498
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:44.779
Anthony Taylor: percentage change from the previous row based on whatever column you send it.

499
00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:48.749
Anthony Taylor: Okay. everybody good. With that one.

500
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:56.999
Anthony Taylor: Only one, I expect, probably is struggling, and maybe and and remember we can. We can get rid of this if we want to.

501
00:45:58.150 --> 00:46:02.770
Anthony Taylor: No, maybe we can't. Oh, no, you have to aggregate it. Aha.

502
00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:04.369
Anthony Taylor: that makes sense.

503
00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:09.179
Anthony Taylor:  yeah. So you have to put something there.

504
00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:12.180
Anthony Taylor: So okay, now I understand why they did that

505
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:20.500
Anthony Taylor: alright. Alright! Alright! Sometimes it just takes messing around  so percent change

506
00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:22.940
Anthony Taylor: rolling window 4.

507
00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:28.319
Anthony Taylor: And then because we did 4 of them, we needed to come up with some kind of aggregate.

508
00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:32.530
Anthony Taylor: In this case, standard deviation. Okay.

509
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:38.470
Anthony Taylor:  and and basically the only real differences is it's doing

510
00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:48.220
Anthony Taylor: multiple. It's taking this one and this one as opposed to just this one and this. And you can change this number. Say you wanted a whole quarter

511
00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:50.820
Anthony Taylor: right it. Now.

512
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:53.089
Anthony Taylor: here's an interesting tidbit.

513
00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:58.169
Anthony Taylor: It's based on.

514
00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:05.699
Anthony Taylor: like the what this window 4 means is a hundred percent based on what your date values are.

515
00:47:06.370 --> 00:47:15.460
Anthony Taylor: So if these were by the hour, this 4 would only be doing 1 h. If these were by the month. this would be doing a whole quarter.

516
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:23.599
Anthony Taylor: everybody clear on that. It's 4 rows. However, the rows are. whatever grain they're at they're at.

517
00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.679
Raugewitz, Tania: Can you just clarify that again? You said

518
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:29.110
Raugewitz, Tania: if it was by the hour.

519
00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:33.129
Anthony Taylor: I would only right. So if this value the date

520
00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:42.219
Anthony Taylor: right? Exactly. So if this was like 1123.3, it was like every hour you basically getting 4 h

521
00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:44.830
Anthony Taylor: in each row in each window.

522
00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:51.199
Anthony Taylor: Okay. By the way, if you guys ever get to do any streaming data stuff, we use rolling windows a lot in streaming data.

523
00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:54.090
Anthony Taylor: Derek, what's your question, sir?

524
00:47:55.320 --> 00:48:00.019
Derek Rikke: Alright. So we clarify that. So is that showing us monthly volatility, then

525
00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:03.379
Anthony Taylor: in this case we? Well.

526
00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:09.540
Anthony Taylor: Sam and II would have. And and actually they say it. Well, right here, it's for period.

527
00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:16.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And all that means is, is whatever this data, whatever the grain of this data is, it's for those.

528
00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:22.359
Anthony Taylor: So this is by week. So it's 4 weeks is every month for weeks. No.

529
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.350
Anthony Taylor: okay, can we all safely say we feel like it is. Yes.

530
00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:29.769
Anthony Taylor: but we know that there's

531
00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:35.190
Anthony Taylor: 52, you know, weeks in year. If every month was 4 weeks they'd only be 48 months.

532
00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:46.179
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So it's not. That's not an accurate state, but it is for period, and that's what I'm saying. If this was an hour. If this was in months, if this was in years.

533
00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:52.780
Anthony Taylor: 4 periods. whatever this date. each row covers. Okay?

534
00:48:53.220 --> 00:49:01.230
Anthony Taylor: So yeah, I don't. I mean, you might use this. If you do some financial stuff, you might use this all right. I

535
00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:14.990
Anthony Taylor: I do something similar with this with, SQL,  but yeah, this is really cool. I'm actually kind of excited. We showed you guys this. I wouldn't get too worried about it. But no, it's there.

536
00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:22.640
Anthony Taylor: Know that it can be done know that you probably will have to Google it when it's time. Okay. alright.

537
00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:24.579
Anthony Taylor: let's move on unless

538
00:49:24.590 --> 00:49:32.849
Anthony Taylor: questions. Actually, I think we're believe it or not. I think we're supposed to be a break. Yep. this is so crazy.

539
00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:36.079
Anthony Taylor: Hold on! I just got to look at how much is left.

540
00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:42.180
Anthony Taylor: Huh? Alright.

541
00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:51.249
Anthony Taylor: I can. Well, it's break time. So just come back at 9. No. 8. Don't come back at 9. That's a really long break.

542
00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:57.069
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Come back at my 9. You're 8. See you in a few.

543
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:58.610
Anthony Taylor: Now I have to start over

544
00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:05.410
Anthony Taylor: alright. Everybody. What I need to do is open browser. Search for Google colab.

545
00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:14.270
Anthony Taylor: When you get to colab. I want to explain what this is. It's an awesome product going to be using Google's processing to

546
00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:17.930
Anthony Taylor: run notebooks. It's all you need to know about that.

547
00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:21.390
Anthony Taylor:  So everybody here

548
00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:25.529
Anthony Taylor: for those that miss this like Rodney.

549
00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:29.239
Anthony Taylor: or when you re-watch this I had to like, do that twice.

550
00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:46.490
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so go to file. You can create a new notebook. If you already have a notebook local, like stored in your Google drive, you can use open. You can even copy one out of Github. But we're going to use upload notebook.

551
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:50.590
Anthony Taylor: upload notebook. We have example notebooks.

552
00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:57.160
Anthony Taylor: We have recent ones. These are ones. I've used stuff on your Google drive. You can go to Github.

553
00:50:57.300 --> 00:51:05.969
Anthony Taylor: We're going to upload from our activities. Folder. So browse. go to wherever you're keeping your

554
00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:11.030
Anthony Taylor: your homework, your activities. Oh, wait! That's that's yours, not mine

555
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:12.690
Anthony Taylor: minds in here

556
00:51:14.850 --> 00:51:23.200
Anthony Taylor: today we're doing activity for. So let's click the unsolved and press open.

557
00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:36.190
Anthony Taylor: Well, Lookie, there, that's a lot of information. really. Really.

558
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.829
Anthony Taylor: So let's just see what we can do here.

559
00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:50.529
Anthony Taylor: So what you can attempt, by the way, to install

560
00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:54.649
Anthony Taylor:  profit on your local drive.

561
00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:59.649
Anthony Taylor: What happened was is some Max have issues with profit.

562
00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:03.110
Anthony Taylor: So yeah, Kevin's like, Yay.

563
00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:10.469
Anthony Taylor: So they decided to use Google Co lab instead. Right? Cause Google ads on the Internet don't matter if you're on a Mac or a PC,

564
00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:13.859
Anthony Taylor: it still works. Okay, so

565
00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:15.640
Anthony Taylor: how do we install something

566
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:20.419
Anthony Taylor: dip, install profit. EROP HET.

567
00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:22.670
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Yeah.

568
00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:29.840
Anthony Taylor: What's gonna happen is you're gonna see up in the top corner here. It's gonna connect, you'll see RAM and disk. That's how much you have.

569
00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:36.809
Anthony Taylor: Notice they give you 13 gigs RAM. You will not have a hundred 7 gigs of hard drive discs.

570
00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:40.649
Anthony Taylor: You will probably have 10 unless you have purchased

571
00:52:40.930 --> 00:52:43.130
Anthony Taylor: 100 gigs of hard drive space.

572
00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:46.880
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Which is like a dollar 99.

573
00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:54.799
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So I had an error. So if you get the error, put an exclamation point in front of it.

574
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:57.619
Anthony Taylor: and try again.

575
00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:13.790
Baro, Sonja: Anthony.

576
00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:18.420
Anthony Taylor: but the the important thing here, in fact, you know what? I'll go grab this out because

577
00:53:19.590 --> 00:53:24.000
Anthony Taylor: I mean, there's like nothing in this. So so I'm gonna go grab this all.

578
00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:30.289
Anthony Taylor: It's good practice. Anyway, you guys see it

579
00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:32.450
Anthony Taylor: question.

580
00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.040
Anthony Taylor: So

581
00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:43.440
Anthony Taylor: this one's a little more interesting because it has like this cool little try, except in case it fails.

582
00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:45.300
Anthony Taylor: it won't.

583
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:52.309
Anthony Taylor: So after we do that, we're gonna import pandas, we're gonna import profit as profit

584
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:55.140
Anthony Taylor: or from profit, import profit.

585
00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:59.350
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna import date time. And we're gonna put map, plot lid in line.

586
00:54:00.330 --> 00:54:03.920
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if you don't do that, they'll run into

587
00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:12.410
Anthony Taylor: errors when you run this next cell. It ran, then this last one import file. So

588
00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:22.730
Anthony Taylor:  we're not gonna do this today. I don't know if we're gonna do it next class, either. But eventually I will tell you that you can. Actually.

589
00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:34.160
Anthony Taylor: you can actually put files in here. Notice, there's a link here that will mount your Google drive to this notebook. So you could put files in there.

590
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:40.750
Anthony Taylor: If you just needed to like, add a file from your desktop. you can. That's not it.

591
00:54:40.930 --> 00:54:41.940
Upload.

592
00:54:42.490 --> 00:54:44.580
Anthony Taylor: and then you can come in here

593
00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:49.150
Anthony Taylor: and like, say, we wanted that apple one from earlier.

594
00:54:51.130 --> 00:54:53.099
Anthony Taylor: we can just add it.

595
00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:56.480
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now we have it.

596
00:54:59.550 --> 00:55:01.589
Anthony Taylor: Which, by the way, you can even open it in here.

597
00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:08.120
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So lots of fun stuff there's we're gonna get into what all this stuff is. Eventually.

598
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:13.770
Anthony Taylor: at the moment, all we want you to know how to open it and how to install profit.

599
00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:17.829
Anthony Taylor: All you really need from this thing is this line.

600
00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:23.809
Anthony Taylor: This is just a really cool, like nifty. Hey? Look, we said, libraries successful?

601
00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:26.190
Anthony Taylor: Okay

602
00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:29.240
Anthony Taylor: questions.

603
00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:36.220
Anthony Taylor: You're you're about to start laughing at me, and I'm already feeling self-conscious about it.

604
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:44.230
Anthony Taylor: Are you ready for this you now have an activity.

605
00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:50.330
Anthony Taylor: Your activity is to go into Co lab and install profit.

606
00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:52.780
Anthony Taylor: and you have 10 min to do

607
00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:00.239
Raugewitz, Tania: between that and the person who wrote

608
00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:03.440
Raugewitz, Tania: for the Fintech also to

609
00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:05.240
Raugewitz, Tania: aye.

610
00:56:08.590 --> 00:56:11.740
Anthony Taylor: I don't think anybody of that team still around.

611
00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:19.130
Anthony Taylor:  yeah. But you know what. However, we really need 10 min do this. I'm guessing we all just did it right.

612
00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:27.129
Anthony Taylor: Right. The only problem is is we're gonna be done really early. because guess how long I'm supposed to spend reviewing it.

613
00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:35.659
Anthony Taylor: You're right. 10 min reviewing whether or not you installed it correctly.

614
00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:39.959
Anthony Taylor: So before we move forward to be fair.

615
00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:45.640
Anthony Taylor: did it work for everybody? Did it not work for anybody

616
00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:57.490
Anthony Taylor: so fist 5 on installing profit on Google Poll App. Look at that! Oh, no. I thought I was, gonna get my first all 5 vote

617
00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:59.870
right? Okay?

618
00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:13.459
Anthony Taylor:  honest to God, guys, that's literally what they wanted me to do just for giggles. I installed it on my laptop, too. But you can't. Well, you have a PC, right?

619
00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:22.869
Clayton Graves: Yeah, it's it's a gaming. Yeah, so it's it's it's pretty good with PC, probably doesn't have a problem with windows as a problem with. And it's not even

620
00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:26.370
Mac. It's like certain OS's of Mac. It has problems.

621
00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:29.609
Anthony Taylor: So anyway,

622
00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:32.730
Anthony Taylor: yeah, that was literally it.

623
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:34.490
Anthony Taylor: So

624
00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:41.659
Anthony Taylor: let's move on to the last demo of the day. I'm gonna go in and I'm gonna load

625
00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:46.160
Anthony Taylor: exercise 6.

626
00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:54.700
Anthony Taylor: So well, since there's so much time, and we'll do the unsolved well. But you guys have this out

627
00:57:55.770 --> 00:57:59.659
Anthony Taylor: all right. We'll do this out. Always forget that.

628
00:58:03.610 --> 00:58:07.549
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So this one's a little more interesting. I'm gonna clear all the output.

629
00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:10.480
Anthony Taylor: Well, first you got it connected.

630
00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:26.379
Anthony Taylor: And now I'm gonna show hide the oh, really wanna clear it. There it is. So if you go to edit, you can clear all the output. So

631
00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:30.540
Anthony Taylor: it's a surprise when you get there. My favorite thing.

632
00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:38.170
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna start with installing profit. We learn that last activity. I know you guys are exhausted from that one.

633
00:58:43.550 --> 00:58:46.930
Anthony Taylor: and that is done. We're going to import

634
00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:50.520
Anthony Taylor: pandas, date time and profit. You guys.

635
00:58:55.370 --> 00:59:03.540
Anthony Taylor: this exercise is so silly I don't even I don't even do it. But I gotta do something. I still have an hour of class time up.

636
00:59:04.350 --> 00:59:10.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So now we're gonna import this file. And this is a pretty cool thing. We're actually gonna read a file from

637
00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:11.940
Anthony Taylor: web.

638
00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:17.870
Anthony Taylor: and then everything else is the same. So really, the only thing that's different is, you're going to read it from a URL.

639
00:59:18.250 --> 00:59:24.109
Anthony Taylor: Alright, and we're gonna drop nulls. and then we're going to look at the head and the tail

640
00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:27.050
Anthony Taylor: of this file. Pretty exciting.

641
00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:34.419
Anthony Taylor: There's the head. there's the tail.

642
00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:40.049
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I will tell you there's some kind of fun things you could do. You could make an interactive table

643
00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.190
Anthony Taylor: in this thing

644
00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:50.110
Anthony Taylor: if you really wanted to. You can even like. do some basic visualizations in here

645
00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:54.200
Anthony Taylor: kind of neat.

646
00:59:55.230 --> 01:00:01.009
Anthony Taylor: We don't do that because it's relatively new. but we can plot price

647
01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:03.629
Anthony Taylor: just like. So

648
01:00:03.790 --> 01:00:08.500
Anthony Taylor: we did this in Vs code, same thing, no different. It's just Jupyter notebook.

649
01:00:10.790 --> 01:00:14.620
Anthony Taylor:  we're calling the data frame profit.

650
01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:29.790
Anthony Taylor: But right now, we're just going to reset the index. Okay, now, the reason we're resetting the index, so profit expects our data in a certain way. right? And what we are basically doing in this activity is prepping our data

651
01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:34.899
Anthony Taylor: for profit. And I'm going to give you. not for money, Mike. I know that's what you would.

652
01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:41.070
Anthony Taylor: So

653
01:00:41.410 --> 01:00:46.819
Anthony Taylor: this is profits. Oh, and this is one of the links in slack for you guys.

654
01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:54.270
Anthony Taylor: One. it does not. You cannot index. Don't put an index on it at all. It wants a natural index.

655
01:00:54.310 --> 01:00:55.949
Anthony Taylor: so 0 through whatever

656
01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:01.180
Anthony Taylor: 2, the date column must be named Ds.

657
01:01:01.770 --> 01:01:05.819
Anthony Taylor: And the volume column must be named Y

658
01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.550
Anthony Taylor: value the the value.

659
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:12.320
Anthony Taylor: This is basically what you're going to predict.

660
01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:17.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, I will just show you this doesn't really matter because we're not going to do it today.

661
01:01:19.170 --> 01:01:21.090
Anthony Taylor: You basically initialize it.

662
01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:25.750
Anthony Taylor: You fit what is fit doing? What's the other word we like to use in Ml.

663
01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:35.020
Anthony Taylor: training. Thank you, Sonya. I read Sonya's lips. Okay?

664
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:37.799
So fit and training same thing.

665
01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:42.700
Anthony Taylor: Once it's fit, we can actually make a data frame and show

666
01:01:43.070 --> 01:01:48.399
Anthony Taylor: what the predictions that profit came up with on your time series data.

667
01:01:48.610 --> 01:01:54.310
Anthony Taylor: There's some other fun stuff in here. We'll talk about later. And it does this really cool visual?

668
01:01:55.860 --> 01:02:00.070
Anthony Taylor: That's what profit does. Are we gonna do any of this today? No.

669
01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:06.999
Anthony Taylor:  so but what are we going to do? Well, first, we're going to reset the index so that it. So this column

670
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:08.980
Anthony Taylor: is no longer an index.

671
01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:12.479
Anthony Taylor: Okay, see how it's an index here. It's it's.

672
01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:16.729
Anthony Taylor: you know, set different. So we're gonna reset it and show the data.

673
01:02:17.570 --> 01:02:20.720
Anthony Taylor: Now, you guys can see it's a flat tape. Everybody agree

674
01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:23.470
Anthony Taylor: any questions on that.

675
01:02:24.730 --> 01:02:26.799
Anthony Taylor: Can you tell how desperate I'm getting here?

676
01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:43.949
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, we need to rename columns. Now, you could do the whole columns rename thing. But remember, we showed you another way to do it. Where, basically, if you say DDF dot columns and you go equals, you can just simply write the new names of the columns in the order of the columns.

677
01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:48.479
Anthony Taylor: So this will change day hour and priced Ds.

678
01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:49.559
Anthony Taylor: and why.

679
01:02:51.850 --> 01:02:53.299
Anthony Taylor: that's what that looks like.

680
01:02:54.410 --> 01:02:55.130
Okay.

681
01:02:55.370 --> 01:02:59.909
Anthony Taylor: profit does not handle null values pretty much. It all.

682
01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:05.649
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to make sure we've done this. Now, who wants to point out we already did this

683
01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:07.880
Anthony Taylor: anybody, anybody

684
01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:14.490
Anthony Taylor: that's okay, though

685
01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:18.470
Anthony Taylor: still not a bad practice. So after you do the Ds and y

686
01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:23.170
Anthony Taylor: do drop in a take a look at the data. It's beautiful.

687
01:03:25.550 --> 01:03:26.960
Anthony Taylor: It's ready for profit.

688
01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.930
Anthony Taylor: which we do on Monday.

689
01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:40.069
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Anthony, I have a question.

690
01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:43.029
Anthony Taylor: Please answer. Ask as many as you could come up with

691
01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:52.480
Meredith McCanse (she/her): on the drop in a. The default is, it's going to get rid of. I can't remember if it gets rid of the whole row.

692
01:03:52.580 --> 01:04:01.520
Anthony Taylor: The whole row of anything is not now. We only have 2 values here. So yeah, I mean, it's probably gonna be the value. But yeah.

693
01:04:01.550 --> 01:04:05.010
Meredith McCanse (she/her): but there's 2 different ways to do it right. You could do any or all.

694
01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:09.370
Anthony Taylor: But I don't know. I don't remember the difference.

695
01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:16.800
Anthony Taylor: It's a great, great one. So any means, if either of these 2 columns are no, it's gonna get rid of it. That's the default behavior.

696
01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:21.239
Anthony Taylor: All means that both columns have to be known

697
01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:22.729
Anthony Taylor: for it to get rid of.

698
01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.000
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay.

699
01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:37.460
Meredith McCanse (she/her): so you kinda have to be careful with it, because if you use the default version with data where you've got, you know, 5 or 6 or 7 columns, you're gonna lose everything in it. You're gonna lose that whole record. If there's if any one of those is null.

700
01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:42.670
Anthony Taylor: If you worked for me and I saw you typing drop in a I'd I'd go slap.

701
01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:48.830
Anthony Taylor: slap your hand. Okay, I see. No, don't ever use drop-in propane. A is not good.

702
01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:52.030
Anthony Taylor: Typically in real data

703
01:04:52.310 --> 01:04:57.009
Anthony Taylor: world. Nobody wants drop an a you. If you're gonna do anything, you're gonna do villainy

704
01:04:57.910 --> 01:05:02.949
Anthony Taylor: right? And and fill an a said, Okay, well, if it's a no value, I want to fill it with this.

705
01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:11.069
Anthony Taylor: So you're going to maybe go through your data. Look at it. You may want to filter out those, but you're not going to drop the row. My God!

706
01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:16.749
Anthony Taylor: Unless it's something like this, and it's only 2 gallons of hair. But but usually you don't see it.

707
01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:24.939
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, usually you don't see drop, and they use. But again, there's only to call Scroll up where? Right?

708
01:05:27.930 --> 01:05:28.730
Okay.

709
01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:44.739
Baro, Sonja: Anthony. The you said there were 2 things that were specific to profit. One was the the index has to be set to the like a table index. Right? What was the second

710
01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:49.319
Anthony Taylor: must be DS, and Y,

711
01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:53.410
Anthony Taylor: yeah, and Ds is the date. And y is the target.

712
01:05:54.970 --> 01:06:06.660
Baro, Sonja: Why can we say, why is the target allow? Why is the target? It's basically what it's gonna be, predicted Gotcha. And that's pretty pretty consistent to the whole email

713
01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:12.480
Anthony Taylor: month or so. We're gonna be doing him out. We will almost always predict why.

714
01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:17.779
Anthony Taylor: And just to be clear, it's just a variable

715
01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.180
Anthony Taylor: yeah man.

716
01:06:19.610 --> 01:06:24.310
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Just profit always has to involve than just 2 2 columns of data.

717
01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:30.180
Anthony Taylor: I don't know that for sure. But the way we're gonna use it. Yes.

718
01:06:30.310 --> 01:06:31.200
Meredith McCanse (she/her): okay.

719
01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:36.860
Anthony Taylor: yeah. I mean, it's just time series. So my guess is, probably. But

720
01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:40.760
Anthony Taylor: I'm not. Gonna I'm not gonna commit to that just yet.

721
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:43.660
Anthony Taylor: Kevin.

722
01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:51.850
Anthony Taylor: when you guys did profit and Fintech does it do more than just one value. do you remember?

723
01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:57.599
Kevin Nguyen: No, no, I think it's just one value, you mean, inputs or outputs.

724
01:06:57.930 --> 01:07:06.829
Anthony Taylor: Well, yeah. So I mean, it says, in the code, you are in the handbook you have to have. Ds, my guess is, this is the only option.

725
01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:09.340
Anthony Taylor: But is there? Can you have 2 values?

726
01:07:10.490 --> 01:07:11.740
Kevin Nguyen: I know. Right? Yeah.

727
01:07:12.690 --> 01:07:19.740
Anthony Taylor: okay. we'll check for sure before we get there. Meredith, we're we're not gonna actually cover profit till next class. So

728
01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:26.990
Anthony Taylor: by lay profit is made by

729
01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:34.719
Baro, Sonja: anybody know, could be Google.

730
01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:39.199
Gebrekristos, Hafton: Facebook, yeah. Have to do.

731
01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:42.959
Anthony Taylor: Facebook made it. That's right.

732
01:07:44.550 --> 01:07:45.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

733
01:07:46.690 --> 01:07:50.719
Anthony Taylor: alright, any other questions on this incredibly difficult

734
01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:52.290
Anthony Taylor: demonstration

735
01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:00.730
Anthony Taylor: guys, I gotta pry. I gotta tell you the Ml. Stuff's not gonna be the season.

736
01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:09.020
Anthony Taylor: I wish it was I really do. I wish this was actually a possible base for the whole course. That would be amazing.

737
01:08:09.810 --> 01:08:16.699
Anthony Taylor: Amazing. This would be, I mean, so relaxing you wouldn't get as much, but it would be relaxing.

738
01:08:17.790 --> 01:08:20.409
Dipinto, Matt: We would still be working on our first list.

739
01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:28.720
Anthony Taylor: It's possible. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah. As you imagine, we're on the twelfth week of python

740
01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:31.980
Anthony Taylor: you'd think you were on on campus taking accredited course.

741
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:34.630
Anthony Taylor: All right.

742
01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.740
Anthony Taylor: get ready for this.

743
01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:41.480
Anthony Taylor: Hold on. Let's look at this first.

744
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:46.249
Anthony Taylor: So well, let's talk a little bit more about time series forecasting

745
01:08:46.649 --> 01:08:55.320
Anthony Taylor: so many industries. Rely on it. I mean, it makes perfect sense. Okay, obviously, we want to see out your profits over time or

746
01:08:55.649 --> 01:09:02.149
Anthony Taylor: our attrition over time. You know everything. Everything is over time.

747
01:09:02.670 --> 01:09:08.270
Anthony Taylor:  sometimes I refer to it as a statistical tool. But

748
01:09:08.430 --> 01:09:13.560
Anthony Taylor: machine learning and statistical tools have a lot of overlap. They both can solve similar problems

749
01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:22.759
Anthony Taylor: the bigger the and in machine learning tools, the only thing they're really the machine learning models are doing are basically coming up with the statistical algorithm. And the fact.

750
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:23.760
Anthony Taylor: Now.

751
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:31.429
Anthony Taylor: is it as good as this one? Not always. Sometimes it's tremendously more complex, but more accurate.

752
01:09:32.050 --> 01:09:36.839
Anthony Taylor: Okay, or has more depth. Either way.

753
01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:43.910
Anthony Taylor: statistics is involved in both. Do you need to know statistics beyond what I've shown you? No, only Jennifer does.

754
01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:45.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

755
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:56.740
Anthony Taylor: Alright, as you learned previously, time series analysis involves analyzing the data and looking for patterns. Profit is gonna help us identify those patterns that aren't as obvious

756
01:09:57.030 --> 01:10:05.640
Anthony Taylor: time series forecasting in 5. Just it's what we've said a billion times now, right? It's looking at what's happened

757
01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:08.820
Anthony Taylor: trying to is trying to figure out what's gonna

758
01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:15.939
Anthony Taylor: and that is time series forecasting.

759
01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:21.220
Anthony Taylor: It can be difficult because we have holidays breaking news, special events.

760
01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:29.560
Anthony Taylor: You name it. Almost anything can change data that

761
01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:37.369
Anthony Taylor: is basically out there in public. So like, so does this affect like machines running in a factory? No, probably not.

762
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:41.690
Anthony Taylor: However, maybe on holidays those machines aren't running as much.

763
01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:45.240
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So maybe it does

764
01:10:45.330 --> 01:10:48.159
Anthony Taylor: right breaking news machines don't care.

765
01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:56.579
Anthony Taylor: Okay, special events. Yeah, maybe maintenance. That's special event to a machine. I know, because I asked

766
01:10:58.720 --> 01:10:59.830
Anthony Taylor: alright.

767
01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:02.430
Anthony Taylor: So we

768
01:11:03.070 --> 01:11:06.130
Anthony Taylor: have been asked to do something.

769
01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:13.400
Anthony Taylor: We're going to automate Time series forecasting. And we've been asked to find the best season

770
01:11:13.690 --> 01:11:15.850
Anthony Taylor: to sell scarves

771
01:11:16.050 --> 01:11:22.409
Anthony Taylor: in Japan and to forecast the demand for starves for one year.

772
01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:27.850
Anthony Taylor: Okay, these scarves are made from out pack of fur.

773
01:11:31.150 --> 01:11:33.849
Anthony Taylor: We don't know anything about the scarf market

774
01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:46.350
Anthony Taylor: in Japan like we know something about the scarf market somewhere else. But we've obtained some data from Google friends to figure out the optimal selling season.

775
01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:49.290
Anthony Taylor: So that's our task.

776
01:11:53.570 --> 01:11:54.420
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

777
01:11:55.100 --> 01:12:04.949
Anthony Taylor: So what are we going to do? So we're going to use our time series analysis skills web identify the people in Japan have more interest in stars in the winter months because of the weather.

778
01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:11.910
Anthony Taylor: We learn that of it. Alright.

779
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:16.650
Anthony Taylor: So it might be optimal to start marketing campaigns in August

780
01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:24.740
Anthony Taylor: and start selling stars by October. Alright. does everybody agree with that? Did that surprise anybody?

781
01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:28.990
Anthony Taylor: Just making sure. Okay.

782
01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:40.119
Anthony Taylor: so external factors, like weather holidays, impact time series and sometimes introduce noise. Noise is not the sound I make all day long.

783
01:12:40.850 --> 01:12:45.429
Anthony Taylor: Okay, noise is information in the data that is essentially

784
01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:46.890
Anthony Taylor: meaningless.

785
01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:54.229
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it distracts from the overall trend or signal of the data.

786
01:12:54.740 --> 01:13:03.070
Anthony Taylor:  yeah. And and we'll see examples of noise. Don't get too worried about it at the moment. Just know

787
01:13:03.410 --> 01:13:06.299
Anthony Taylor: if I say, do you guys see any noise here?

788
01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:12.399
Anthony Taylor: All right, and you're going to be looking for stuff that is distracting us from the actual thread.

789
01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:13.880
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

790
01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:20.610
Anthony Taylor: so we're going to use profit. It's a very cool tool. It's an open source library. It was made by Facebook

791
01:13:20.690 --> 01:13:24.369
Anthony Taylor: to analyze time series data

792
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:32.160
Anthony Taylor: showed you this visual already. We're going to be making this visual with our data. And we're going to be able to explain what all that means.

793
01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:34.700
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

794
01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:47.670
Anthony Taylor: so it automates the process of Time series forecasting. So you can focus on the business problem. It also tests and forecasts as many scenarios as you identify.

795
01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:49.050
Anthony Taylor: That's a big deal.

796
01:13:49.810 --> 01:13:58.529
Anthony Taylor: Profits forecasting automation can help you simplify your time series analysis. It deals with noise. It deals with holidays.

797
01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:02.169
deals with special events when it knows about them.

798
01:14:02.830 --> 01:14:07.499
Anthony Taylor: And something we haven't talked about. Time series, decomposition.

799
01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:10.570
Anthony Taylor: So profit

800
01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:13.529
Anthony Taylor: is effectively. An auto. Ml.

801
01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:18.090
Anthony Taylor: auto, ml, is short for automated machine learning.

802
01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:22.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay, basically, we just have to set up the data.

803
01:14:22.850 --> 01:14:25.700
Anthony Taylor: tell it what we want, and it'll go out and do it

804
01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:28.430
Anthony Taylor: pretty cool. Right?

805
01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:32.940
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna use Google Colab. We've already done this.

806
01:14:33.210 --> 01:14:39.900
Anthony Taylor: I showed you that there were no questions. You guys didn't do the activity. There it is. Look at that.

807
01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:56.010
Anthony Taylor: But we did review it. And okay. so I love this, look at what the activity says. Data. Prep for-profit. Okay.

808
01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:00.330
Anthony Taylor: so now let's go back and look at it one more time, because I've been talking a lot of time.

809
01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:04.610
Anthony Taylor:  where to go. Here it is.

810
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:09.889
Anthony Taylor: So what did we do to prep? We made sure the index was a normal

811
01:15:09.950 --> 01:15:15.859
Anthony Taylor: index by resetting the index doesn't matter what the index is, if you reset it, it'll be normal.

812
01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:23.660
Anthony Taylor: Okay. and we renamed our date column to Ds

813
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:26.680
Anthony Taylor: and our target column or value

814
01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:27.890
Anthony Taylor: to why?

815
01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:31.399
Anthony Taylor: And we dropped nose.

816
01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:33.330
Anthony Taylor: That's it

817
01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:43.910
Meredith McCanse (she/her): in in Google. Colab, do you have to like save this file? Or do you have to do any sort of like syncing it with your

818
01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:47.460
Anthony Taylor: you. It's automatically saved.

819
01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:52.800
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so like, if you go in here and look at like like I've been working with these all day to day.

820
01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:57.390
Anthony Taylor:  I can look you. There's also a revision history, by the way.

821
01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:00.769
Anthony Taylor: but I can open.

822
01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:03.080
Anthony Taylor: and I can see all the ones I work with today.

823
01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:06.430
Anthony Taylor: Actually, I can see the ones I've worked with for a long time.

824
01:16:09.130 --> 01:16:10.040
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

825
01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:19.140
Anthony Taylor: you can save these to Google drive. I believe it saves them automatically to Google drive. But if you notice you can download it.

826
01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:25.820
Anthony Taylor: you can save it. You can even save a copy to Github if you want to set up your github. Okay.

827
01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:37.429
Anthony Taylor: yeah, Google, cold labs are really cool thing. Probably the only reason we don't start with Google co-lab is because most of our work you can do locally on your laptop.

828
01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:45.979
Anthony Taylor: Okay, as we start getting deeper and deeper into the Ml AI. Space, your laptops are going to start to become insufficient.

829
01:16:47.550 --> 01:16:51.100
Anthony Taylor: And you're gonna want the power that Google App can offer us.

830
01:16:52.330 --> 01:16:54.289
Anthony Taylor: Okay, good news is.

831
01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:57.100
Anthony Taylor: don't think we'll ever have to do a cost on this

832
01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:01.450
Raugewitz, Tania: a what?

833
01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:06.100
Anthony Taylor: Any kind of charges you kind of pay for anything?

834
01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:09.210
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, yeah, there is a a

835
01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:21.070
Anthony Taylor: like you can get in here. And in fact, you can even use a gpu on this one so you could come in here and do a T. 4 gpu. and running it

836
01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:28.959
Anthony Taylor: for those that don't know what that is. That's a graphic processor. Why do we want a graphic processor as we're doing? Math

837
01:17:30.170 --> 01:17:35.689
Anthony Taylor: and graphics processors are tremendously better at especially matrix math

838
01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:37.479
Anthony Taylor: than a Cp.

839
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:48.520
Anthony Taylor: so when we get to our machine learning, we might switch to a Gpu or you can actually purchase.

840
01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:52.849
Anthony Taylor: And yet even more GPS

841
01:17:54.130 --> 01:17:56.670
Anthony Taylor: 10 bucks a month. But we don't need to do that right now.

842
01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:02.410
Anthony Taylor:  I don't think we're gonna run into, but we might never know.

843
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:03.880
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

844
01:18:05.310 --> 01:18:17.109
Anthony Taylor: I've delayed as long as I possibly can. So you now have an activity to do. Okay. activity 7. You're going to open it up

845
01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:28.270
Anthony Taylor: in Collab. You're going to open it. You're going to read the Google Trends data, independence data frame. flop the trends. prepare it for profit

846
01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:32.880
Anthony Taylor: and stop

847
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:37.450
Anthony Taylor:  you have

848
01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:41.260
Anthony Taylor: 20 min to knock this out.

849
01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:46.320
Anthony Taylor: What time does class actually end like an hour from now? Right?

850
01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:55.740
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Well, maybe while you guys are in there, I'll try to find something else for us to do. because this is the last activity of the night.

851
01:18:56.670 --> 01:19:00.299
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright, it's Tony's like. No.

852
01:19:04.870 --> 01:19:18.579
Raugewitz, Tania: I would not, personally, but you know some others might

853
01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:23.419
Raugewitz, Tania: on class stuff stuff that I'm behind on.

854
01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:25.150
Anthony Taylor: That's true.

855
01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:34.940
Anthony Taylor: Well, I'll try to come up with a we'll we'll see. I mean, I might not be able find anything fast enough. But we'll see. I have told you guys some stuff that we were gonna talk about.

856
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:39.309
Anthony Taylor: So maybe we can get into some of that, but I won't keep you the full time

857
01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:40.650
Anthony Taylor: for sure.

858
01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:42.550
Anthony Taylor: Hi, Hi, Gay!

859
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:44.430
Anthony Taylor: You have 20 min

860
01:19:44.810 --> 01:19:46.829
Anthony Taylor: now that we're done talking that

861
01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.979
Anthony Taylor: so was that hard? Anybody have any trouble with that?

862
01:20:01.950 --> 01:20:13.100
Clayton Graves: Not this time, I mean, please don't get used to this. This is very much an anomaly in this program

863
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:23.500
Anthony Taylor: on the plus side. It's probably kinda nice right for project to have a fairly easy week. Hopefully, the the challenge is as easy because.

864
01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:35.789
Anthony Taylor: honestly, that activity was naughty. It had stuff that we didn't show you. So you guys would have been mad if I gave you that activity. The one with the the shift and and the percent change. And all of that.

865
01:20:35.850 --> 01:20:38.000
Anthony Taylor: I mean, they expected you to look that up.

866
01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:41.100
Anthony Taylor: So that would have been painful.

867
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:46.349
Anthony Taylor:  yeah. So hopefully, the challenges.

868
01:20:46.890 --> 01:20:50.579
Anthony Taylor: anyway. So you pulled in the data, we got some out packet data.

869
01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:53.830
Anthony Taylor: Canada and Uruguay way way.

870
01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:55.940
Anthony Taylor: We can plot it out.

871
01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:58.069
Anthony Taylor: Bam, looking good.

872
01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:07.159
Baro, Sonja: Yeah. So I had a question on this. And I probably board my my group with my questions on this was

873
01:21:07.290 --> 01:21:25.019
Baro, Sonja: okay, I was like, why would we do this? Why would you plot this? So there's really nothing you can see from this, because you have different temperature scales. You have different, like I was like, why, and then we just went ahead and just did. But like, when you see this stuff in real life.

874
01:21:27.210 --> 01:21:36.259
Baro, Sonja: II mean, I was pause. But I was like, we gotta convert this to either the same type, or or maybe that's the whole point of

875
01:21:36.730 --> 01:21:43.500
Anthony Taylor: phantom, or whatever it is we're using here.

876
01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:59.560
Anthony Taylor: Sorry I'm not trying to. No, no, no, I love your question, and it's a good question, and it's a real question, and the real answer is, like many things I've told you guys most a lot of the stuff we teach you. We want you to know

877
01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:04.419
Anthony Taylor: you should know it. You may or may not use it in this way.

878
01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:05.919
Anthony Taylor: but you should know it.

879
01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:09.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I need you to know how to plot data

880
01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:11.530
Anthony Taylor: using pandas.

881
01:22:11.850 --> 01:22:17.070
Anthony Taylor: This is an exercise of plotting data. Pandas does. Can you do analysis on this?

882
01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:20.739
Anthony Taylor: I don't even know what those values are. You

883
01:22:22.930 --> 01:22:29.449
Baro, Sonja: sales? I thought it was temperature right? Oh, it's Google Trend.

884
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:35.170
Anthony Taylor: So okay, I guess that makes a little more sense. It's going by week

885
01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:38.940
Anthony Taylor: showing the Google trends in Canada

886
01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:42.840
Baro, Sonja: and Uruguay. Oh, search number of search.

887
01:22:43.210 --> 01:22:45.840
Baro, Sonja: Is that what happened? I thought we were looking for Japan.

888
01:22:46.250 --> 01:22:52.799
Baro, Sonja: So I'm a little confused by that. Google trends.

889
01:22:53.860 --> 01:23:01.679
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So so for those places. So we're going to. II and I'm okay with that, because we could make the argument that

890
01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:13.630
Anthony Taylor: you know, if Canada and Uruguay have similar trends, then we could say, we can apply that to Japan and say, Well, similar here, I mean Canadians and Uruguayans are probably very similar

891
01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:16.330
Anthony Taylor: to Japanese people. I don't know

892
01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:17.839
Anthony Taylor: what they were thinking.

893
01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:19.830
Anthony Taylor: but I mean, it's an option.

894
01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:25.069
Anthony Taylor: Do you have a thought on that, Tanya? Go for it. I wanna hear it. Oh.

895
01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:44.509
Dipinto, Matt: shift it by 180 days.

896
01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:49.110
Baro, Sonja: There you go, Matt, so. But that's my point.

897
01:23:49.410 --> 01:23:51.200
Baro, Sonja: I'm like, Oh, my gosh!

898
01:23:51.430 --> 01:24:00.330
Baro, Sonja: Anyway, I'm sorry I don't mean to take us. I love it, and you know what we don't even know that these people don't have. You know they're not offended by out package. We have no idea.

899
01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:02.879
Baro, Sonja: Packages are pretty offensive

900
01:24:04.490 --> 01:24:05.700
Anthony Taylor: alright.

901
01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:09.639
Baro, Sonja: especially when they spit at you or wait. That's the llamas.

902
01:24:13.770 --> 01:24:17.730
Anthony Taylor: I you know what? I don't know that I really know the difference.

903
01:24:20.850 --> 01:24:25.049
Anthony Taylor: They're long necked dogs as far as I can.

904
01:24:25.370 --> 01:24:31.420
Anthony Taylor: One spit spit, apparently one spit. Wait. Isn't that a camel. Alright, alright enough.

905
01:24:32.230 --> 01:24:40.789
Anthony Taylor: I've tried to keep you guys till 9. Pm, okay, so here, we're gonna rename. Or actually, we're not going to rename. We're only going to select

906
01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:42.440
Anthony Taylor: weed in Canada.

907
01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:48.939
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then we're going to rename it to BS. And Y, and you could do this whatever method you preferred.

908
01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:54.230
Anthony Taylor: Okay. and we're gonna do one for Uruguay the same way.

909
01:24:58.910 --> 01:25:00.459
Anthony Taylor: My act like folk.

910
01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:05.149
Raugewitz, Tania: I have a question. That's it. Yes, Tanya.

911
01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:13.690
Raugewitz, Tania: So when we were looking at the changing the column names from week in Canada to DS. And y.

912
01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:21.950
Raugewitz, Tania: did we? Why didn't we need to use double square brackets for the Ds and Y like we did for a week in Canada.

913
01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:25.159
Anthony Taylor: Well, so here we were. So

914
01:25:25.190 --> 01:25:37.610
Anthony Taylor: okay, so if we only want, let's let's do it this way. If we only wanted week, we would only need one bracket. Right? So what we're saying is is, we want 2 columns to get 2 columns you have to pass in a list.

915
01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:44.550
Anthony Taylor: So this inside bracket is the list.

916
01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:54.169
Anthony Taylor: And so that's why we have. So here we're doing a dictionary. We're doing a whole different method now, earlier, like in the other example.

917
01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:58.830
Anthony Taylor: We just did df columns equals and gave it a new.

918
01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:08.320
Anthony Taylor: a list of column names. That one was a single list. This one were using the rename function that you guys learned before.

919
01:26:08.570 --> 01:26:10.400
Anthony Taylor: So it's a little different. But

920
01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:17.580
Raugewitz, Tania: we we? Okay? So we did not use the rename. We just did that. The columns equals

921
01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:22.850
Anthony Taylor: square bracket Ds.

922
01:26:23.650 --> 01:26:31.129
Anthony Taylor: are we supposed to use the rename? No, no, I think it did save the user rename. Did it not rename the columns

923
01:26:32.250 --> 01:26:42.969
Anthony Taylor: as possible, too? So in that case you could use whichever one you prefer. The way we did it in my example. we did it this way.

924
01:26:43.130 --> 01:26:46.040
Raugewitz, Tania: You says you can use everything function. Yeah.

925
01:26:46.590 --> 01:26:51.569
Anthony Taylor: right? So it says, dot columns. And then we passed in a list of what to name the columns.

926
01:26:51.620 --> 01:27:03.129
Raugewitz, Tania: So you don't need double brackets. Okay? Because it's we're just using a list. Okay? Right. We're just passing in a single list. The other one has double brackets, and we needed to pass

927
01:27:03.290 --> 01:27:15.570
Anthony Taylor: a list into the double brackets, and that's why it has 2 double brackets. II realize that's a little confusing. But anytime, if you would have tried to do it like with

928
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:19.160
Anthony Taylor: without the double brackets like this.

929
01:27:19.290 --> 01:27:30.520
Raugewitz, Tania: it would have basically told you, you need double brackets. Yes, and I. So I understand that you need it up there. It's just like, why didn't you? For the Ds. And why? That's why I didn't. That's great questions.

930
01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:33.290
Anthony Taylor: Good question. I like them.

931
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:36.159
Anthony Taylor: Any other who left?

932
01:27:38.530 --> 01:27:41.089
Anthony Taylor: Where's Halften? Was Halfton, wasn't it.

933
01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:45.620
Anthony Taylor: Dog got it? Have to gonna get extra home.

934
01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:51.109
Raugewitz, Tania: Well, technically, we can miss 45 min with and still be counted here.

935
01:27:51.570 --> 01:27:56.209
michael mcpherson: That's true. Alright, I guess he doesn't. I thought it was. Actually.

936
01:27:57.830 --> 01:28:03.559
Anthony Taylor: whenever. anyway, this is all I have for you guys today,

937
01:28:04.970 --> 01:28:06.499
