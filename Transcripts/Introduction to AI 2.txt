1
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.680
Anthony Taylor: Did you want to introduce yourself and all that fun stuff?

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:32.869
Nick Kinger (SSA): Yeah, I felt bad. I couldn't make it until launch but they, too, made it in glued to be here. Everyone. My name's Nick. You have gotten a ton of emails from me. I just wanted to at least show my face and introduce myself quickly. Not. Take up too much your class time, because you definitely have a full agenda but I wanted to open the floor in case anyone had any questions and give a brief background because, the university slide was a little bit iffy. If I could put a phone

3
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:43.970
Nick Kinger (SSA): fun. Fact or not. I think Gabby made a comment about that. So just a fun background, I have a background as a middle school science teacher, I did that for 7 years. That was 7 years too much.

4
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:55.300
Nick Kinger (SSA): So now I'm here, every second of it. But other than that, you know, we'll get to know each other over time. But just really looking forward to working with everyone. And I couldn't be more excited about the AI program.

5
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.850
Anthony Taylor: Fantastic. Anybody have questions for Nick.

6
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.589
Anthony Taylor: II would just say, you guys understand what Nick is to us. To me.

7
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:14.100
Anthony Taylor: right is is again anytime. You guys need help with like grades or not. Great. What like

8
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:38.919
Nick Kinger (SSA): easiest definition. If it's curriculum, don't ask me, because I will have no idea. If it's curriculum. Go to Anthony, go to your amazing instructional team. If it's anything else to do with the boot camp. I'm your guy, and if I'm not. I'm gonna find out for you and make it happen. That's my role. So if there's anything you guys need

9
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.819
Nick Kinger (SSA): again, don't ask me AI questions. Oh, not pretty, but everything else. I'm here.

10
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.270
Anthony Taylor: We we'll teach Nick how to use when you ask me AI questions

11
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.059
Nick Kinger (SSA): who live experience with Chat Gpt.

12
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:08.890
Anthony Taylor: I think everybody on the planet. They want to stay that right. It it's like everybody's like what to do to take my job.

13
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:20.199
Nick Kinger (SSA): no, absolutely. And again, I'm here for everyone. My virtual doors always open. You guys will get a lot of emails from me. Please read them. I know it's a lot but important information coming your way, but

14
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:33.809
Nick Kinger (SSA): that's everything. If you think of anything don't hesitate to reach out and kinder@bootcamps.com. I'm also linked in our general channel on slack at the top. You'll see my calendar, Link, if you need to ever schedule some time with me.

15
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.119
Anthony Taylor: There you go.

16
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.240
Nick Kinger (SSA): Yeah, you're good to go. Have fun.

17
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.900
Nick Kinger (SSA): Thank you, sir.

18
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:56.500
Nick Kinger (SSA): You take care or hang out, or whatever you want to do. Alright.

19
00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.180
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

20
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.920
Anthony Taylor: Okay,

21
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:10.650
Anthony Taylor: yeah. So now we get started with impact of machine learning day 2,

22
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.269
Anthony Taylor: all right. So today, we're gonna cover a bunch of fun stuff.

23
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.360
Anthony Taylor: We're going to talk about supervised and unsupervised machine learning.

24
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.569
Anthony Taylor: We're going to define more complex AI models, including neural networks and deep learning. So I gotta tell you guys.

25
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:43.010
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna make these funny faces when I see stuff like this, if they're email models, remember, AI or Ml is a subset of AI, so you can say, say, AI models. But if you said an AI model, you know a neural network as an AI model, people forget you.

26
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.619
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so I'm just telling you.

27
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.710
Anthony Taylor: You can say it. It's not wrong.

28
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.100
Anthony Taylor: but it's unusual.

29
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.880
Anthony Taylor: Then we're gonna talk a little bit about Mir natural language processing

30
00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.210
Anthony Taylor: and transform. These are all things we're gonna get very deep into

31
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.379
Anthony Taylor: as the weeks go by. But today kind of keep it out, either.

32
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.039
Anthony Taylor: we're also gonna learn how to actually use Github.

33
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.159
Anthony Taylor: Everyone's got it working right? Hopefully, you're locked in. Well, today, you're gonna learn how to use it properly.

34
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.339
Anthony Taylor: very highly.

35
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:24.979
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're gonna add, commit push, code. Github, we're not gonna do any merge resolution. Clayton. Nothing like that.

36
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:36.970
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we are gonna Branch. But we're going to branch very carefully. Only Clayton knows what I'm talking about. But that's okay. because he's the get guy, right? Clayton, you're the get guy.

37
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.099
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, all right.

38
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.950
Anthony Taylor: Okay, demystifying machine learning.

39
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.520
Anthony Taylor: I do need a background. I you know II should do that.

40
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.510
Anthony Taylor: I had the last class. On the final project day.

41
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.220
Anthony Taylor: one of my one of the students. They did their whole

42
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:05.130
Anthony Taylor: portion of their final project with with the background music. It was so

43
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.909
Anthony Taylor: good. It was 95. I said. I'm gonna have that all the time.

44
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:18.450
Anthony Taylor: Play something like, you know. Mission, impossible music in the background while I talk. Okay? So first off.

45
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:33.880
Anthony Taylor: Just like I said a moment ago, machine learning is A is a subset of AI these are like the official definitions. It is the practice of applying computer algorithms and statistics to create models that can learn from data.

46
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:41.380
Anthony Taylor: then make decisions or predictions about future data. Before today is over, we're going to clarify this

47
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.350
Anthony Taylor: cause. This makes it sound like Whoa makes decisions.

48
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:53.870
Anthony Taylor: It's kind of binary. In that sense. You can have classifications which you can classify many different layers.

49
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.849
Anthony Taylor: But these decisions, all of this is based on

50
00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:03.239
Anthony Taylor: history. And that's it. It doesn't make up anything.

51
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.439
Anthony Taylor: It has no creativity.

52
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.300
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

53
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.010
Anthony Taylor: algorithms are not make decisions without meeting anyone program. All that logic.

54
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:18.669
Anthony Taylor: They learn the patterns, behaviors and logic on their own directly from data. Then

55
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.200
Anthony Taylor: I'll clarify that, too.

56
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.089
Anthony Taylor: Okay, nothing is that there's nothing a computer does. It's on its own.

57
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:32.690
Anthony Taylor: Let's just get that clear. We're not making Skynet like. was it, Clayton? That, said Skynet.

58
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.120
Anthony Taylor: No, Mike.

59
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.480
Anthony Taylor: Mike, said Skynet. Sorry, Clayton. It's the beard. I got him confused.

60
00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.520
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

61
00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:51.030
Anthony Taylor: yeah, we're not making Skynet, because we really don't have a way for computers to figure it out themselves. And yet

62
00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.619
Anthony Taylor: I am not sharing my slides.

63
00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.270
Anthony Taylor: That's okay. Here's what you missed.

64
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.919
Anthony Taylor: That's what you missed. Okay, pretty much so.

65
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:15.760
Anthony Taylor:  yeah, they they really can't do anything. Now, I will show you something some point. During this 24 weeks called Auto Ml, which is almost the closest. You're going to get

66
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:27.350
Anthony Taylor: to a computer, figuring everything out by itself. But she's still got to tell it what you want to figure out you still got to give it instructions. Computers follow instructions. Even AI's

67
00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.090
Anthony Taylor: alright. And we'll talk more about that as we go.

68
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:36.829
Anthony Taylor: So there's 2 major classes.

69
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:40.340
Anthony Taylor: machine learning. unsupervised learning

70
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:46.749
Anthony Taylor: and supervisor. The difference between the 2

71
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:55.810
Anthony Taylor: is unsuper. Well, these are the types regression algorithms used to model predict continuous variables. Whatever. Okay, the let me go back to here.

72
00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:01.379
Anthony Taylor: The difference between these 2 and it's gonna come up again in a slideshow. I mean, Natalie on

73
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.120
Anthony Taylor: is

74
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:08.360
Anthony Taylor: supervised learning. We're going to give the algorithm

75
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:09.740
Anthony Taylor: the answer.

76
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:12.620
Anthony Taylor: that's what it means.

77
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:17.869
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So in other words, we have all this data. And this data is labeled.

78
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:26.030
Anthony Taylor: Okay, let me give you a very famous example. You see this all over the Internet. There is a data set out there on the Titanic.

79
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:33.340
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And it has like, when they got on the boat, what was their gender? What was their age? What kind of ticket did they have?

80
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay, what cabin were they in.

81
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.940
Anthony Taylor: and did they live or die?

82
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.650
Anthony Taylor: Believe or die?

83
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:49.750
Anthony Taylor: Was is the predicted variable? That's what we want to predict. If if we put a new person on the Titanic

84
00:08:50.820 --> 00:09:01.150
Anthony Taylor: that got on at this stop? And was this gender? And was this age, and had this ticket, and was staying in this cabin. Could we predict if they lived or died?

85
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.500
Anthony Taylor: Alright? That is supervised learning? We know the answer.

86
00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.500
Anthony Taylor: Something more practical for today.

87
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.130
Anthony Taylor: Loan defaults.

88
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:21.780
Anthony Taylor: Okay, here's a great one for you. One of the companies I worked at for a while was Hertz rent a car. Everybody familiar with Hertz rent a car.

89
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:27.599
Anthony Taylor: You got to be right. They're out in Fort Myers, Florida. I built their entire data science platform

90
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.110
Anthony Taylor: by myself.

91
00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.420
Anthony Taylor: Okay, put it together.

92
00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:37.250
Anthony Taylor: brought in some data science. Well, they had data scientists. In fact, they had 52 data scientists

93
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.430
Anthony Taylor: of those 52 data scientists, only one knew how to use machine learning.

94
00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:45.119
Anthony Taylor: Okay, the rest of them were really just equal people with the cool type.

95
00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:55.379
Anthony Taylor:  but we basically built a machine learning model that would predict the likelihood that this person would steal the car.

96
00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:58.740
Anthony Taylor: Yep.

97
00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:02.329
Anthony Taylor: and it was it was shockingly.

98
00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.090
Anthony Taylor: But did they rent the car to that person?

99
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:06.790
Anthony Taylor: You betcha?

100
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:18.809
Anthony Taylor: Because why? Because it was shockingly accurate about 90% of the time. So as you imagine, if during that 10%, we said, Oh, look! Meredith came up to, she's gonna steal this car.

101
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:23.540
Anthony Taylor: We're not gonna let her have one. Hello. sued.

102
00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.650
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So they just did it. And

103
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:35.860
Anthony Taylor: we tracked every one of those cars. We had a map that showed where the car was. and as soon as it crossed the Mexican border they just wrote it off.

104
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.459
Anthony Taylor: and it was done no more car.

105
00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:55.739
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And it happened every day. But you know, it's just that's how rental car business. Actually, I'll have all kinds of fun stories about rental car. I've been like. I said. I work medical most of the time, but my last big

106
00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:01.009
Anthony Taylor: contract that I did before I went into arthritis was Hertz. So I have lots of herbs.

107
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:03.009
Anthony Taylor: They're actually a really good

108
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.100
Anthony Taylor: example for me to give you, because

109
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.709
Anthony Taylor: they went from

110
00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.809
Anthony Taylor: basically barely having a data warehouse to having one

111
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:17.610
Anthony Taylor: of the better data analytics platforms that they could have asked for.

112
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.889
Anthony Taylor: And yeah, I made it. So I'm bragging a little. But

113
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:26.460
Anthony Taylor: it just it just worked out. Okay, okay? So supervised learning, we have a label.

114
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:33.240
Anthony Taylor: Typically, it's when we have a label. If that label is word or a binary.

115
00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:37.549
Anthony Taylor: you'll yes, no. Prove false. That is classification.

116
00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:39.280
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

117
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:43.500
Anthony Taylor: regression. This is continuous numbers.

118
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:46.929
Anthony Taylor: Okay, regression is a really tricky one.

119
00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:54.219
Anthony Taylor: Give you actual projects that students have done basketball salaries. Did I tell you this one already? I feel like I told you this one.

120
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:56.389
Anthony Taylor: No, okay.

121
00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:07.899
Anthony Taylor: Basket. If I ever do that by way, I'm bad about telling stories more than once, so you'll go ahead and stop me. Say, Hey, Anthony, so I'll be like, huh! I'll give you, anyway, basketball salads. So

122
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:20.230
Anthony Taylor: group their group, they were all into basketball. They thought this was cool. There is a ton of statistics on basketball. So they built machine learning model that would predict a basketball player's salary based on their college statistics.

123
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:22.289
Anthony Taylor: Pretty cool. Right?

124
00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.899
Anthony Taylor: They ran it. And they were. They had like 4% accuracy. I'm like dude.

125
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:30.210
Anthony Taylor: That means if you flipped a coin the coin would hit you in the head and hurt you.

126
00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:36.930
Anthony Taylor: Okay, no, you want at least 50%, so that at least you can say, Well, I can put coin, and I get the same answer.

127
00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:43.639
Anthony Taylor: No. The reason was is that when you do regression. You're guessing numbers, exact numbers.

128
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:52.849
Anthony Taylor: So if their salary is $400,000 and 4 cents. and your model predicts $400,000, it's wrong.

129
00:12:55.220 --> 00:13:08.579
Anthony Taylor: So there are ways to work around that. But we'll talk about like really easy ways to work around that are less accurate. And then we'll talk about ways to kind of, say, all right. Well, 400, only 4 cents off. That's not so bad.

130
00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.170
Anthony Taylor: We can still work with that.

131
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:18.060
Anthony Taylor: Okay, regression is a very common thing, but a lot of people get mixed up. They're like Whoa! But I couldn't get any good accuracy with that. What the

132
00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.190
Anthony Taylor: right? How about, we make it a range that works.

133
00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:27.399
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But then, if it's a range, are you doing a number? No, you're doing a classification.

134
00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:36.730
Anthony Taylor: Hi. unsupervised learning. So if the key factor of supervised learning is, you have to have a label

135
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:46.210
Anthony Taylor: unsupervised learning means. I don't have a label. I don't know who what this data is, I have no clue.

136
00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.759
Anthony Taylor: Okay, unsupervised learning is incredibly valuable.

137
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:52.660
Anthony Taylor: What does it do

138
00:13:53.100 --> 00:14:09.410
Anthony Taylor: I throw in one of my clients many years ago, with dell or, well, sorry I worked at Dell. It was target. Okay? And target has some wonderful. There's some stories online about target and their data science stuff that are really, I mean, they're like infants.

139
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:13.840
Anthony Taylor: And I was actually like, involved with the teams that that built that stuff.

140
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:18.330
Anthony Taylor:  but they have

141
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:24.380
Anthony Taylor: tons of data. those cameras? Yeah. But I mean, everybody's been target, right?

142
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.929
Anthony Taylor: Or something similar. You walk in. And if you look up, what do you see?

143
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:34.000
Anthony Taylor: Little black domes every 10 feet in the whole store.

144
00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:38.280
Anthony Taylor: Right? Yes, they're looking for shoplifters for sure.

145
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.410
Anthony Taylor: Okay, what they're also doing is tracking how we walk through the store

146
00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.830
Anthony Taylor: and what you bought.

147
00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:57.829
Anthony Taylor: So you come in, they see. Oh, look! She goes to the right every time, and then she goes down that middle aisle that's about halfway down between the women's clothing and the gift car and the breeding cards.

148
00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:01.240
Anthony Taylor: and she goes down to the back, and then oh, look! Look! Look, look.

149
00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:04.490
whoever she's with just went into the electronics area.

150
00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:10.809
Anthony Taylor: And they're looking at video games. And then she went to the right, which is over by seasonal goods.

151
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.289
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. Does that just describe? Like every target on the planet? I think I did.

152
00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.919
Anthony Taylor: Okay, then

153
00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:23.170
Anthony Taylor: they're watching you. They basically tag you. They said. I don't know who this person is, but we're gonna call it Shopper B.

154
00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:28.070
Anthony Taylor: So Shopper B. Finishes going through the store. Doesn't shoplift

155
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.020
Anthony Taylor: goes to the front and pays.

156
00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:34.679
Anthony Taylor: And they pray that you have that little red car.

157
00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:44.159
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if you haven't been to target red card is basically their reward system. Okay, the reward is for them.

158
00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:49.780
Anthony Taylor: Alright. You scan it. That's what they just learned.

159
00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.090
Anthony Taylor: Shopper B is Sonia

160
00:15:53.450 --> 00:16:02.919
Anthony Taylor: Sonia Maro. Oh, and we have the history of everything she's ever purchased. Let's go back and see how she walked to the store the last time. Oh, look at that!

161
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:16.329
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now. Moral of this story. Where. So where? How does it still to unsupervised learning? Well, they have all this data. Yeah, they know it's signing, but that doesn't necessarily tell us who is like, son.

162
00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.270
Anthony Taylor: I want to know

163
00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:24.050
Anthony Taylor: when I passed in all of this data, all of the people that shop like Sony.

164
00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:37.349
Anthony Taylor: so I don't have a label cause. I don't know what they like. I don't know who they are. so I'm going to run an unsupervised model, and the unsupervised model is going to take this big ball of data

165
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:44.050
Anthony Taylor: and start separating it and separating it. And you can literally watch it. Do it into clusters.

166
00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:51.469
Anthony Taylor: And it's gonna say, oh, look at this Sonya and Curry. They shop almost exactly the same.

167
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.670
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Jennifer and Matt.

168
00:16:55.690 --> 00:17:03.319
Anthony Taylor: They're more just kind of. They go different directions every time they come in they go straight for what they want. They don't shop

169
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:11.879
Anthony Taylor: right. They're like they come in with a grocery list. They go to the groceries. They kept the groceries they leave. That's a style of shop.

170
00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:19.650
Anthony Taylor: It's not my stuff. I'm like, walk around the store for 2 h. Okay? Oh, I need that alright.

171
00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:31.399
Anthony Taylor: So unsupervised learning allows us to do that. Now let me ask you a question. If I take a group data and I, and I cluster it with unsupervised learning, and it breaks into 4 groups.

172
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.340
Anthony Taylor: Do I have a label? Now?

173
00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:43.899
Anthony Taylor: I kind of do right. I have 4 groups, so I can figure out why those 4 groups clustered together and label them.

174
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:48.150
Anthony Taylor: which means, now go back over to supervise

175
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:53.720
Anthony Taylor: which it tends to be betterable. or it's easier to work.

176
00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:57.679
Anthony Taylor: Okay, unsupervised. There's only a few that even do anything.

177
00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:07.150
Anthony Taylor: but they do it well. then, supervised, there's hundreds of algorithms that we can run dimension or dimensionality section.

178
00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:18.639
Anthony Taylor: This mostly refers to. We have tables that have like 500 columns. So basically, we have 5 or 499 dimensions in one label.

179
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:26.230
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's too many. The algorithm, if it does need all of those, it's going to be horribly slow.

180
00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:38.040
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so what we do is we can run dimensionality reduction, which effectively looks at all the dimensions and says, You know what these 50 and these 50 are similar.

181
00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:43.240
Anthony Taylor: Let's just put them into one value and bring them back over here and use them.

182
00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:51.069
Anthony Taylor: And and this allows us to have smaller width of data to pass it. Yeah, click.

183
00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.759
Clayton Graves: Can you define what a dimension is in this context?

184
00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:01.350
Anthony Taylor: I love that. So for machine learning, you have your label, you have dimensions.

185
00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:05.000
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Or you have what you're trying to predict, and you have dimensions.

186
00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:10.129
Anthony Taylor: So, for instance, on the Titanic example.

187
00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:14.320
Anthony Taylor: okay, the dimensions for the Titanic example were

188
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:15.850
Anthony Taylor: the ticket.

189
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:19.600
Anthony Taylor: the gender, the age where they got on the boat.

190
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:24.540
Anthony Taylor: So like that, you'll also hear that called features. That's another way.

191
00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:30.849
Anthony Taylor: Okay, dimensionality reduction is a term that came around before people started calling them features.

192
00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:36.920
Anthony Taylor: Well, one term you're going to hear a lot is feature store. which is basically storing the dimensions.

193
00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:42.969
Anthony Taylor: And no, it's not dimensions like in a Erd like a data warehouse. Not that kind of dimension.

194
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:48.040
Anthony Taylor: Or like, if you're building a house not like hike with.

195
00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:50.310
Anthony Taylor: yes, Sonya.

196
00:19:51.170 --> 00:20:07.369
Anthony Taylor: yeah. So II had 2 questions for you. One is to check my understanding. Make sure I'm tracking with you. So clustering. So, Netflix recommendations of what to watch that. Okay.

197
00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.440
sonja baro: okay? And so then my second question was.

198
00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:18.790
sonja baro: well, the way you describe dimensionality reduction almost to me sounds like a version of clustering. It's just clustering

199
00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.240
sonja baro: different attributes.

200
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:24.269
Anthony Taylor: which is why it's over an unsupervised learning.

201
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:36.240
Anthony Taylor: right? Because what it does, it does exactly like what you just said, you take these 500 499 columns, and it starts figuring out which of these are similar enough to cluster into a single value.

202
00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:49.289
Anthony Taylor: And if we're lucky we get down to like this one algorithm. I don't know if we'll get to it in this class at Pca, and you can even tell it. Hey? I would take these 499 calls to make him a 10,

203
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:54.970
Anthony Taylor: and it will every time, and then it'll tell you how much you lost.

204
00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:03.159
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you'll say, hey? I made 10 out of it, but you know what. I only got 98, or 92

205
00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:06.349
Anthony Taylor: of that of of the you know of the whole thing.

206
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:16.500
Anthony Taylor: I of the value of the whole thing. If you didn't do this now, that would be a great trade off. But if you took it before 99 to 10, and it said, you got, you know, 50%.

207
00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:20.510
Anthony Taylor: Now you're like, no, let's make it, you know. Let's make it 30

208
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:30.410
Anthony Taylor: capability.

209
00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:41.310
Clayton Graves: So so basically. what it's doing is maybe it has a black chair, blue share, red chair, green chair, whatever.

210
00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:49.259
Clayton Graves: And it basically takes the all the descriptions and says, Oh, those are colors and clutches those together.

211
00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:53.309
Clayton Graves: And then over here they're all chairs, plus of those together

212
00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:59.319
Clayton Graves: is that kind of what it's doing that that's a great way to envision it.

213
00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:04.030
Anthony Taylor: yes, it is what it's doing there. There's There's actually

214
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:06.890
Clayton Graves: I'm almost seeing it like a database.

215
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:11.479
Clayton Graves: like a database, where where you take

216
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:16.069
Clayton Graves: a certain amount of attributes. and you make a table out of em.

217
00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.989
Clayton Graves: and then when you enter that data in, you put those.

218
00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.259
Clayton Graves: put that data in under those headers.

219
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:27.139
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I mean it. It is that way.

220
00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:32.860
the the hard part about explaining dimensionality reduction without actually doing it

221
00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:38.630
Anthony Taylor: right is when we do so. So there's this term, we're gonna get to called interpretability.

222
00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:45.220
Anthony Taylor: Okay, interpretability is like a big term right now. And you guys may not even have heard it.

223
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:56.010
Anthony Taylor: But in in this context, but basically what it means to us. And one of the big arguments about the new AI stuff is, can you tell us why it came up with that answer.

224
00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:01.829
Anthony Taylor: okay, so some of the stuff we're gonna learn in supervised learning.

225
00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:05.069
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna show you how you can tell how the model

226
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:13.090
Anthony Taylor: weighed each attribute, each dimension. It's going to say, Hey, you had 20 dimensions, these 3.

227
00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:16.740
Anthony Taylor: They played 95%

228
00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:20.479
Anthony Taylor: of why we came to the decision. We came to

229
00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:24.459
Anthony Taylor: these others. Yeah, tiny, it'sy bitsy bit.

230
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:31.619
Anthony Taylor: hey? They weren't very important at all. So with dimensionality reduction, all it does is this, will those 3? I'm not gonna miss

231
00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:33.570
Anthony Taylor: because they're super important.

232
00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:42.490
Anthony Taylor: But these other ones down here. We maybe we can combine them. Make some kind of like, you know, in in your example, you know. Maybe we'll just say, instead of saying.

233
00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:48.430
Anthony Taylor: red, orange, blue and chair chair, chair chair, we're going to say red chair, blue chair, orange chair.

234
00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.559
Anthony Taylor: Make it what? Instead of 2,

235
00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:56.769
Anthony Taylor: it separates the relevant from the irrelevant

236
00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:03.520
Clayton Graves: and condenses it together, and can absolutely okay.

237
00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.250
Anthony Taylor: Alright, Sonya. Yes, I love all the questions.

238
00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:22.489
sonja baro: Yes, so I'm just curious. This thing between interpretability. And then what Clayton just shared are these ways that we can seek out bias in a

239
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:26.209
Anthony Taylor: jeez? Yeah, I do where I'm at.

240
00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:30.650
Anthony Taylor: Oh, I'm just curious. The short answer is.

241
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:44.429
sonja baro: do you like test something? Because you're coming? You said you can you tell it? Why, that it gave us this answer. And if you're

242
00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:53.230
Anthony Taylor: right, we can say like, Okay, so let me say this. let's say we do. A model and gender and race

243
00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.350
Anthony Taylor: are 2 of the main factors that it used

244
00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:58.250
Anthony Taylor: right clearly.

245
00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:08.360
Anthony Taylor: particularly in today's scenario gender race with not be a good way to do. You know, we wouldn't want that to be the primary decision points.

246
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.610
Anthony Taylor: Okay,

247
00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:13.930
Anthony Taylor: and and keep in mind most of the time. Our data is historical.

248
00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:28.420
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So if we had historical data. Up until a few years ago there were but 2 genders registered in a database. It doesn't mean that we're only is to be clear. Doesn't mean. There were only 2 genders few years ago, but

249
00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.189
Anthony Taylor: nobody was recording them.

250
00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:40.030
Anthony Taylor: Right? It's only as good as the data, right? The data coming in. But as far as finding bias bias is really hard thing. It will.

251
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:58.029
Anthony Taylor: II don't know if we're gonna have, like the in the in the data course we have like this whole ethics, and and a whole bias lecture. We could talk about it at different times throughout when it comes up. I don't know that they're gonna have that in here. AI itself has its own

252
00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:12.459
Anthony Taylor: ethical bio bias type problems. And the biggest problem right now with AI like the Llibs. It's they're very difficult to interpret. right? It's incredibly difficult to figure out

253
00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:17.680
Anthony Taylor: why it came up with that answer.  yeah.

254
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:22.530
Anthony Taylor: I mean, even if you do it at bing chat, where it literally gives you the links of where it found the answer.

255
00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:28.080
Anthony Taylor: Okay, sometimes the things it says you're like, well, that wasn't on that page. Where did it get that?

256
00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:33.090
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we know how it got it these days. But we don't know why.

257
00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:35.850
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so anyway.

258
00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:46.139
Anthony Taylor: that's those are great questions, guys I love. I love. I don't care if we run late. I'll figure it out. Yeah, Captain, what's up? You gotta raise your hand. But you know, just wave that scream.

259
00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:49.960
Anthony Taylor: Go ahead.

260
00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:55.690
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're going to work on reed and ditch with that. No, we can't hear you, Bud.

261
00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:00.680
Anthony Taylor: -Oh! Picture, mic. No sound

262
00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.290
Anthony Taylor: always that worried. But, oh, God! What's going on

263
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:13.350
Anthony Taylor: now? Check under the look under the little the little microphone thing, and make sure you're using the right microphone.

264
00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:16.940
Anthony Taylor: I'm not using the right mic. Oh, yeah, yeah.

265
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:22.029
michael mcpherson: You talking to me. There you go. No, I'm talking half.

266
00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:24.240
Gebrekristos, Hafton: How about now?

267
00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:28.860
Anthony Taylor: Yes, was I talking to you, Mike? I don't know, Captain. So I meant to be talking

268
00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:36.170
Gebrekristos, Hafton: this. Probably this is off topic. But II play this online online gambling stuff. You know, these fan.

269
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:45.570
Gebrekristos, Hafton: right? Yeah. I play a lot. But I don't know how it works in the background. I'm just curious what that belongs to.

270
00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:52.319
Anthony Taylor: if even if it is AI or mission learning at all. So wait. So fan dual. Isn't that just a gambling site?

271
00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.669
Gebrekristos, Hafton: It's a gambling platform. Correct?

272
00:27:55.170 --> 00:28:01.729
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, that's just a I mean, that's almost, you know, that's like, I'll send you over to Gabriel, because that's basically an app

273
00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:11.790
Anthony Taylor: right there's there. There is probably like suggestions, recommendations that would, you know, come your way from Sandal I am not playing with. It's not actually legal with Texas.

274
00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.380
Anthony Taylor: right. We have to gamble with bookies.

275
00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:17.950
Anthony Taylor: We don't get to gamble on our phones.

276
00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:22.510
Anthony Taylor: But I don't know. II would have to look at it myself.

277
00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:27.940
Anthony Taylor: if it has any kind of suggestions or recommendations. probably AI of something.

278
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.959
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But overall, it's probably just an app.

279
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:39.759
Gebrekristos, Hafton: Okay, it does. It does suggest, and it has. All this recommendation is probably to stuff like that. But II was always curious how it works.

280
00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:49.480
Anthony Taylor: Well, we can, I mean II don't said I can't even use it here, so I can't really give you a whole lot. But if I find a way to look at it, I will, but I'll tell you.

281
00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:50.770
Anthony Taylor: I don't mind

282
00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:56.999
Anthony Taylor: alright. So that's a great question, though I like it like, I said, keep asking questions, folks.

283
00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:00.349
Anthony Taylor: I'll tell you if we have to stop asking questions which will never happen.

284
00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:04.320
Anthony Taylor: but unsupervised learning. Okay, here's a picture

285
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:14.260
Anthony Taylor: next. Sorry there's really nothing to say. It's unlabeled data interpretation. That simply means just prepping the data, the algorithm that we train

286
00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:18.440
Anthony Taylor: it processes it. And then it outputs it into separate clusters.

287
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:22.799
Anthony Taylor: That's it. We'll know what those clusters are when it goes in.

288
00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:29.019
Anthony Taylor: We can interpret what they are when they come out. Okay. Now I'm in Clayton yon. I'm not doing well.

289
00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:34.780
michael mcpherson: alright. Last thing mathematically on paper.

290
00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.269
Anthony Taylor: You remember doing this mathematically on paper?

291
00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:41.020
michael mcpherson: Yeah, I can do that mathematically on paper.

292
00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:46.820
Anthony Taylor: Huh? Oh, this this exact picture. Alright. If you could, I'd be probably good.

293
00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:51.910
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so where do we use it? Exploratory data analysis.

294
00:29:51.930 --> 00:30:00.240
Anthony Taylor: unsupervised learning? Probably every data science project I've ever been involved in. Usually the first model is unsupervised.

295
00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:04.070
Anthony Taylor: Because why? Because most people don't label their

296
00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:18.870
Anthony Taylor: I they just don't. So what's the first thing we got to do? We got to label the data. How do we label it? If we cluster it first. then we have to do a lot of analysis to figure out what each of those clusters mean. And once we do got you, Clayton, go ahead.

297
00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:24.089
Clayton Graves: So I'd almost see unsupervised learning is

298
00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:29.679
Clayton Graves: mine. A bunch of rock.

299
00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:35.090
Clayton Graves: And the unsupervised learning is is basically processing that.

300
00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:44.650
Clayton Graves: And then the refinement it's separating the rock from from the good stuff. And then the refinement is actually making the gold bars, or or whatever

301
00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:54.120
Anthony Taylor: to some degree. Yeah, I mean, the idea the bottom line is is unsupervised. Learning is I don't want to label my data. Or

302
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:59.070
Anthony Taylor: I wanna label my data, and I need a way to do it. And this is the fastest way to do

303
00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:18.800
Anthony Taylor: so. I think I think we're hitting the same thing. Alright, yeah, so cross. So these are some uses cross selling, consumer segmentation. Select the target example, pattern recognition. So by pattern recognition, what we mean is, you have rows of data. They have 2030, 50, a hundred columns.

304
00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:32.190
Anthony Taylor: right? And we want to look for patterns that match row a row B or C, or D, or F cetera. right? It doesn't even have to be for any specific purpose other than we want to see what's similar about our data.

305
00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:35.449
Anthony Taylor: and if we can find patterns in it that we didn't know about

306
00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:37.750
Anthony Taylor: alright supervised

307
00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:42.179
Anthony Taylor: apples and bananas, pears and oranges. Those are my labels.

308
00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:52.120
Anthony Taylor: I pass it into my supervised learning model, and then the next time I pass in a blue apple, look at thing, it will call it an apple.

309
00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:59.170
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this is your dog cat example. You know. They look at pictures. All that stuff.

310
00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:01.370
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

311
00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:06.649
Anthony Taylor: So the biggest thing. Take away from this unsupervised no late supervise. Gotta wait.

312
00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.640
Anthony Taylor: Okay. good.

313
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:17.389
Anthony Taylor: I love it. They call it instructor demonstration. There is no demonstration. It's just me talking again.

314
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:24.860
Anthony Taylor: We don't have a lot of lot of activities in these first 2 day free days. But we will, I promise. I promise

315
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:28.279
Anthony Taylor: you'll have so many activities. You'll miss me. Yes, son.

316
00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:46.990
sonja baro: So on that last slide, the supervised learning, I'm wondering, are there any? So if the the question, the core. The core determination is is my data labeled right? Depending on.

317
00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:56.940
sonja baro: is there any benefit, even though you've got the data labeled to strip the label and push it through an unsupervised

318
00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.759
Anthony Taylor: and everything I mean.

319
00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:08.320
sonja baro: Well, that's on that like, what benefits do you get like? Do you find new ways like, did you miss a pattern, maybe, or I'm just.

320
00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:13.310
Anthony Taylor: it is possible. So here's the answer I'll give you as a consultant.

321
00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:21.129
Anthony Taylor: Okay, not as as a consultant who has experience in this. Right? I would tell you if you got the bucket

322
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:22.840
Anthony Taylor: go for.

323
00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:30.650
Anthony Taylor: Okay. The thing is is what what a lot of people don't realize. All the models we're going to train in here. Take seconds to train.

324
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:35.319
Anthony Taylor: Okay, the models we trained at herks and and

325
00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:39.659
Anthony Taylor: pennant and lots of other places. They can take weeks

326
00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:41.190
Anthony Taylor: to trade.

327
00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:46.969
Anthony Taylor: okay, and cost close to $1020,000 to train one time.

328
00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:54.799
Anthony Taylor: and then we have to do it 20 times to make sure it's right. So a lot of times where

329
00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:59.680
Anthony Taylor: what you'll find out is that people don't want to do that extra work.

330
00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:00.890
Anthony Taylor: you know, but

331
00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:08.309
Anthony Taylor: there's no reason you you can't do it. And you're right. They could identify things, you know, labels that you might have missed.

332
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.800
Anthony Taylor: And then what's that?

333
00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:18.940
Anthony Taylor:  it could identify labels you might have missed. Sure they could. And if if you had the money and the time, why not

334
00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:21.900
Anthony Taylor: so? Yeah, yes, Ronnie.

335
00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:32.490
Masarirambi, Rodney: so. So you mentioned that it could take, you know, Weeks, and the amount of money to train the model is that

336
00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:42.040
Masarirambi, Rodney: sure? Is that cost calculated and like, like, you know, renting out the servers and that kind of stuff. That's where the cost is or where where is the cost? In that.

337
00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:47.090
Anthony Taylor: So I will tell you guys this. my background in the last

338
00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:58.719
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. 6, 7 years is no more than almost 10 is all cloud. Okay, I don't deal with servers in server groups anymore. I used to long time

339
00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:05.929
Anthony Taylor: so for us on the cloud, what we do is we just virtually spin up.

340
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:08.180
Anthony Taylor: However, many computers we.

341
00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:13.870
Anthony Taylor: And if we need Gpus, we spin up Gpus until they tell us they don't have any more available. I've had that happen?

342
00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:23.440
Anthony Taylor:  yeah, I mean, you know. And and that cost the more computers we spin up to do the work. It's basically charged by the minute.

343
00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:34.509
Anthony Taylor: Okay, how long we're using it. And you would think it sounds like a lot of money. The the truth is, it's, you know, a good high-end computer might only cost you, you know.

344
00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.390
Anthony Taylor: 10 cents a minute.

345
00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:48.979
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but add that up to and out. now and then you add it up to like 2 weeks. 24 HA day. This is an expensive process, and usually we use many.

346
00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:53.390
Anthony Taylor: The the largest one I've used in the last few years is 50.

347
00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:56.939
Anthony Taylor: And by 50 I mean servers

348
00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:04.279
Anthony Taylor: with multiple processors and multiple threads on each processor. Okay? So we were probably looking at like

349
00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:09.570
Anthony Taylor: 500 threats. Something in that range. I don't. And I mean

350
00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:15.950
Anthony Taylor: I did not look. I don't care. I mean, I look at the number of notes. So we had 50. Okay? But

351
00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:19.630
Anthony Taylor: it was, and that one was expensive, very expensive.

352
00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:25.960
Anthony Taylor: So anyway, that's how we price it. If you have your own computers on site that you're doing this in.

353
00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:32.749
Anthony Taylor: you'll find one. You'll be limited. But 2. It's it may not cost you as much. It's a stickle.

354
00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:35.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay. alright.

355
00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:38.270
Anthony Taylor: unless you have Clayton's big computer.

356
00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:41.510
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Okay.

357
00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:43.520
Anthony Taylor: So

358
00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:47.870
Anthony Taylor: we talk about 2 types of learning.

359
00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:56.400
Anthony Taylor: Now, we're gonna talk about a specific style of using Ml, or specific styles. I remember, method.

360
00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:59.830
Anthony Taylor: a specific method. How we do.

361
00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:01.160
Anthony Taylor: Ml.

362
00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.190
Anthony Taylor: okay.

363
00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.109
a neural network

364
00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:17.449
Anthony Taylor: seta algorithms that are modeled, that human brain neural networks are designed to mimic the way our brains function with artificial neutrons serving the same purpose as our biological biological mirror.

365
00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:26.870
Anthony Taylor: What does that mean? Well. if you I don't think we have a picture of a neuron in here. No, they used to have it.

366
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:34.799
Anthony Taylor: imagine the neuron, everybody remember, looks like a tadpole kind of with all these like pencils coming out of the tail. Okay,

367
00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:38.249
Anthony Taylor: basically, what it does is we pass in

368
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:39.440
Anthony Taylor: data

369
00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:44.559
Anthony Taylor: to a an activator algorithm.

370
00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:53.689
Anthony Taylor: And it looks at it, and it goes. Oh. of these things this seems more important. and it assigns a probability.

371
00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:56.120
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

372
00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:03.199
Anthony Taylor: And then it takes those, and it passes it to either another layer or another activator to give you an answer.

373
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:06.250
Anthony Taylor:  and

374
00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:08.690
Anthony Taylor: it does this in such a way

375
00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:16.159
Anthony Taylor: that it gives the appearance of a neuron. one going in, many coming out.

376
00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:20.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay, one going in, many coming out.

377
00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:28.309
Anthony Taylor: And I mean, actually, there's more than one going in up to the first one. But the the point of the matter is that each one of these are considered neurons.

378
00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:36.179
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And each one of these will look at a different aspect of the incoming data

379
00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:38.130
Anthony Taylor: weighted.

380
00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:44.390
Anthony Taylor: Apply an activation algorithm and believe or not, you all are going to know how to do this in a few weeks.

381
00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:51.759
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and then send it to another. Possibly another layer depending on how you configured your neural network.

382
00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:55.219
Anthony Taylor: There could be many layers. It could be hundreds of layers.

383
00:38:57.150 --> 00:39:04.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then eventually it gets to the end. And it goes, okay, this is probably

384
00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:05.750
Anthony Taylor: that's right.

385
00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:08.879
Anthony Taylor: And that's how it works.

386
00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:14.340
Anthony Taylor: Okay. now be. Yeah, Rodney, go for it.

387
00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:16.470
Masarirambi, Rodney: So

388
00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:22.629
Masarirambi, Rodney: the first question I have, and maybe maybe it's self assigned. Maybe it's like a dumb question. But

389
00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:29.009
Masarirambi, Rodney: what's the advantage of the neural network, I mean, isn't there like

390
00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:38.070
Masarirambi, Rodney: cause we're we're trying to think of it like how a human brain things. But surely there's a better option that's out there, or something that we could.

391
00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:44.920
Masarirambi, Rodney: That's that would be better than our brains. I like just kind of thinking, like nothing better than the human brain.

392
00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:51.529
Anthony Taylor: I know that's a scary thought. The human brain has more computational power

393
00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:58.749
Anthony Taylor: in one little teeny iota than all the quantum computers that are out there today. Okay? But

394
00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:03.420
Anthony Taylor: and and be honest with this was developed back in the 60 s.

395
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:06.990
Anthony Taylor: The first guy that came up with this idea

396
00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:09.329
Anthony Taylor: drew it on a paper

397
00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:14.879
Anthony Taylor: in the 60 S. He couldn't. I don't think he lived long enough to see it ever work.

398
00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.959
Anthony Taylor: because we just didn't have the power to do.

399
00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:23.090
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I will tell you this. Neural networks are

400
00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:27.180
Anthony Taylor: they? Were to Ml, you know what Google was to the Internet.

401
00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:36.400
Anthony Taylor: You could do wonderful things without neurobibles. And you were right, a lot and great things. But there were definite limitations.

402
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:40.369
Anthony Taylor: Neural networks pretty much eliminated the limitations.

403
00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:45.270
Anthony Taylor: And we can solve almost any problem with neurode.

404
00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:48.370
Anthony Taylor: But yes, like.

405
00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:54.989
Clayton Graves: it's just seems like fancy clustering to me.

406
00:40:55.250 --> 00:41:02.080
Clayton Graves: I mean, it's essentially you can do the same thing right now with a supercomputer. And you take.

407
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:08.979
Clayton Graves: You have multiple no's, and they all work simultaneously on whatever job or task to give them.

408
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:15.090
Clayton Graves: That's great computing, and that's but that's not what this is.

409
00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:20.899
Anthony Taylor: I understand the picture II follow. I follow.

410
00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:23.520
Anthony Taylor: But the the picture gives you that I got.

411
00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:27.120
Anthony Taylor: Understand each of these circles is another algorithm.

412
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:33.529
Anthony Taylor: Okay, each of these circles are an algorithm. As it comes out, we apply another algorithm

413
00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:38.990
Anthony Taylor: that takes the probability that the that came from this algorithm and assigns it.

414
00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:41.829
Anthony Taylor: Do each of these lines going into the next

415
00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:44.980
Anthony Taylor: node, which is yet another album?

416
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:53.999
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then that algorithm and and all of the dog words are created through a training process. So it looks at it. It goes well.

417
00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:59.949
Anthony Taylor: this is the triangle. Okay, we have the algorithm to figure out a triangle.

418
00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:03.699
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Oh, now we got a square. Well, let's figure out the differences.

419
00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:13.990
Anthony Taylor: And which of the factor that is coming in. Are we going to assign a higher probability to? Well, obviously, if it was a triangle now, it's a square 4 corners.

420
00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:18.229
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Oh, but this one's a diamond. Man!

421
00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:24.839
Anthony Taylor: 4 corners looks like 2 triangles. What are we going to do. you see? So I get what you're saying.

422
00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:32.350
Anthony Taylor: But when we do this in programming, you'll see that that the the grid that we're creating is all a bunch of functions.

423
00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:37.870
Anthony Taylor: The good news is. we only have to know what the functions are. Please have to know the page.

424
00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:48.789
Anthony Taylor: So this will get easier to comprehend when we actually do it. Oh, yeah, honestly, guys, I just want you to know this exist. We're going to do all of this in class. We spend a week

425
00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.349
Anthony Taylor: on neural networks.

426
00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:57.330
Anthony Taylor: Okay, 3 full classes, learning and doing and creating neural networks.

427
00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:01.519
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And the same for supervised and same for unsupervised.

428
00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:05.639
Anthony Taylor: So you're gonna get plenty of practice today is just overview of.

429
00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:11.020
Anthony Taylor: we have a visitor. Oh, you guys can't see her patience.

430
00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:13.179
Anthony Taylor: Okay, anyway.

431
00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:19.850
Anthony Taylor: So yeah. So please, all of you do not get hung up on. I don't understand this. I don't expect you to.

432
00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:25.900
Anthony Taylor: What I want you to do is understand? It's here. And this is what we're gonna do. We're still kinda in like introduction.

433
00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:34.369
Anthony Taylor: So what are some advantages of neural networks versus traditional machine learning models? First off, you guys don't even know what they are. I never told you.

434
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:42.480
Anthony Taylor: I'll tell you, neural network is called a neural network traditional model. Random Forest. That's my favorite.

435
00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.930
Anthony Taylor: Okay, ran a forest

436
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:48.570
Anthony Taylor: support vector machine. That's a good one.

437
00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:52.709
Anthony Taylor: K-means, also a tradition.

438
00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:58.359
Anthony Taylor: Alright, anyway. So advantages. And you're gonna learn all of those. By the way, that I just said

439
00:43:58.570 --> 00:44:10.340
Anthony Taylor: you're actually gonna know what those are and know how to make them effectively detect complex relationships within our data. This is what the neural networks do better than anybody. And this is why they're so valuable.

440
00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:15.420
Anthony Taylor: They can predict consumer. But they can predict practically anything.

441
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:20.169
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So why don't everybody use neural networks? Well.

442
00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:23.070
Anthony Taylor: no one can interpret that

443
00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:25.510
Anthony Taylor: no one knows why.

444
00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:29.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay, they are

445
00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.050
Anthony Taylor: a black box.

446
00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:34.620
Anthony Taylor: No one knows what's happening inside the brain.

447
00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:40.580
Anthony Taylor: All we know is, if we give it 5 layers, 6 nodes each.

448
00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:42.119
Anthony Taylor: We get a good answer.

449
00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:46.630
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But

450
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:55.069
Anthony Taylor: if I said, tell me what to tell me how it came up with that you'd be like horrible 5 layers, 6 note views. But he won't for me.

451
00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:57.939
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and that's just the fact.

452
00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:06.229
Anthony Taylor: Oh, you know another disadvantage they don't mention in here. They're freaking computationally, monsters.

453
00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:09.360
Anthony Taylor: To do this

454
00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:11.870
Anthony Taylor: across many layers

455
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:16.799
Anthony Taylor: is a monster. It will take so many cycles.

456
00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:18.840
Anthony Taylor: How many of you have heard about

457
00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:22.910
Anthony Taylor: the the carbon footprint of chap. Gp.

458
00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:30.049
Anthony Taylor: It's like the equivalent of like every car on the planet, revving its engine for 2 days straight

459
00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.769
Anthony Taylor: to train it. One time

460
00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:37.110
Anthony Taylor: they've trained it hundreds of times.

461
00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:44.490
Anthony Taylor: I mean the. It's it's massive. The computational power to do all this stuff is huge.

462
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:57.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright, deep learning. I love, deep learning versus neural network. What's the difference? Neural network is one layer of neurons. You have an input, one layer of neurons output neural network.

463
00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:01.440
Anthony Taylor: deep learning more than one layer of neurons.

464
00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:05.939
Anthony Taylor: Think you guys can handle that one, that one's easy, right? One

465
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:13.949
Anthony Taylor: or more than one. That's it. Additional layers help make the algorithm be more efficient at there you go. So this is

466
00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:17.080
Anthony Taylor: neural network. This

467
00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:24.690
Anthony Taylor: is not. This is deep learning. Okay, there you go. I got my, I got my circle on.

468
00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:26.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

469
00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:31.409
Anthony Taylor: that's it. Neural network, deep learning eliminate. I tell you it's complicated. It's not

470
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:39.710
Anthony Taylor: alright. No network people.  this is a fairly okay. So let's talk about picture.

471
00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:43.700
Anthony Taylor: One of the things that neural networks are deep learning in particular.

472
00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:55.370
Anthony Taylor: is very good at is recognition. So all of those things where you have photos and they recognize something or recognize your face. Everybody use Google photos or something like it. Right? It's recognizes everybody in your family

473
00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:58.749
Anthony Taylor: and people in other people's families. It's like, Hey, isn't that, Joe? From?

474
00:46:59.890 --> 00:47:02.170
Anthony Taylor: Alright? It recognizes everybody.

475
00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:04.540
Anthony Taylor: Those

476
00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:09.629
Anthony Taylor: pictures are huge amount of pictures. But let's just talk about a simple

477
00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:14.840
Anthony Taylor: 24 by 24, black and white picture.

478
00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:19.009
Anthony Taylor: How many pixels is that?

479
00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:24.080
Anthony Taylor: 728, of course.

480
00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:35.110
Anthony Taylor: Okay, III trust me, I didn't do the math. I have okay, 728 pixels. That means 728 inputs

481
00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:36.920
Anthony Taylor: into our model.

482
00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:47.439
Anthony Taylor: we pass them all in. It looks at all of them, and it determines it when it uses those pixels placements

483
00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:50.850
Anthony Taylor: to try to learn what that picture was.

484
00:47:52.290 --> 00:48:06.089
Anthony Taylor: and it can do it with dogs and cats. It can do it with motorcycles and bicycles. It can do it with practically anything. If you go to azure or aws today, they have a service that they've already trained with practically every picture available on the Internet.

485
00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:17.670
Anthony Taylor: And because of that. they can identify almost anything. I know somebody's gonna talk about facial recognition. Yes. that's out there, too.

486
00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:31.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it doesn't mean that people are using. It doesn't mean they're not. But it's how it works. looks at your face finds unique features. It gets enough pictures of your face. It can figure out who you are

487
00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:44.710
Anthony Taylor: once it knows enough. Is there an exact Doppelganger review? I can tell you. It's possible I have a brother when we were kids. He's 2 years younger than me. You could not tell us apart.

488
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:48.330
Anthony Taylor: I wouldn't have known that I didn't know him when I was a child.

489
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:53.539
Anthony Taylor: and know until I was 52 natural language processing.

490
00:48:55.020 --> 00:49:01.110
Anthony Taylor: This is fun stuff. And this is where we're gonna start getting into the Llm stuff. We're not now. But this is how we're gonna get to it.

491
00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:03.539
Anthony Taylor: Okay, natural language processing

492
00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:14.720
Anthony Taylor: combines the rules of human linguistics with Ml algorithms to not only translate text into a format that a computer can understand. But to essentially understand the meaning behind the words.

493
00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:21.309
Anthony Taylor: That is a very high level and it was not true very long ago.

494
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:24.949
Anthony Taylor: Okay, natural language processing

495
00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:29.110
Anthony Taylor: goes through a number of steps. Well, okay, and in large language models.

496
00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:39.770
Anthony Taylor: I don't think I don't know if we're gonna talk more about the other one you might. I don't know. Large language models. This is your chat. Tpp. This is your bard. This is your lama, 2, Dolly.

497
00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:41.779
Anthony Taylor: Everybody know who Dolly is.

498
00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:43.959
Anthony Taylor: This is the one

499
00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:52.520
Anthony Taylor: I literally a stuffed animal of the Dolly AI model. Okay.

500
00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:59.309
Anthony Taylor: if it was given to me at the I was at the AI summit just recently. So

501
00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:03.580
Anthony Taylor:  anyway, let's say, deep learning

502
00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:05.179
Anthony Taylor: many notes

503
00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:17.380
Anthony Taylor: algorithm that can recognize, summarize, translate, predict, and generate text and other forms of content based on knowledge gained from mass

504
00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:26.649
Anthony Taylor: data sets. These data sets have as many as yeah. Well, they claim that GPT. 4 has a trillion totals.

505
00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:38.199
Anthony Taylor: Okay? The llama. 2, one just recently released by Meta. Facebook, right? Has 70 billion tokens.

506
00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:46.039
Anthony Taylor: 70 billion effectively 70 billion words. And here's a real kicker. You can download the whole model in your computer.

507
00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:53.169
Anthony Taylor: whole thing and run it on your computer. Well, you have to have a pretty big video card, but you can do it.

508
00:50:54.070 --> 00:50:56.209
Anthony Taylor: We're not going to do that in class, in fact.

509
00:50:56.250 --> 00:51:08.300
Anthony Taylor: not 100%. I know how I'm going to do it if they haven't solved it before we get to it. But we'll have to come up with some clever ways to run some of these models, because most of you will not have a computer that can handle it.

510
00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:17.050
Anthony Taylor: Local. We'll have to do it somewhere on the Internet.  yeah. a transformer model

511
00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:24.680
Anthony Taylor: is actually a step on the way to the large language model. But it's basically a neural network. And

512
00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:33.800
Anthony Taylor: it really is a deep learning network that learns context and thus meaning by tracking the relationship and sequential. So yesterday, I mentioned these 2 guys right

513
00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:37.600
Anthony Taylor: when we first started natural language processing, we did it a word at a time

514
00:51:38.350 --> 00:51:41.820
Anthony Taylor: when I teach it to you. That's the first way I'm gonna teach it to you.

515
00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:46.680
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're gonna have text. and you're gonna be able to read through it.

516
00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:54.420
Anthony Taylor: And you know, with your algorithm, and it's going to come up with sentiment analysis. But it's going to come up with it, based on a word.

517
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:56.700
Anthony Taylor: one word.

518
00:51:57.570 --> 00:52:06.629
Anthony Taylor: maybe 2 or 3 words in a sentence are all positive. So therefore it's positive. But if there's 2 words negative one's positive

519
00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:08.130
Anthony Taylor: right.

520
00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:10.600
Anthony Taylor: then it could be negative.

521
00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:14.940
Anthony Taylor: That SOB. Was

522
00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:18.309
Anthony Taylor: mean, but man in service was great.

523
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:21.980
Anthony Taylor: Is that, good or bad, that positive or negative.

524
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:27.390
Anthony Taylor: Alright, how do you know? Well, natural language processing, that's how

525
00:52:27.690 --> 00:52:29.219
Anthony Taylor: it initially started.

526
00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:34.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay, transformers. And what's called the attention model

527
00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:40.249
Anthony Taylor: is basically doesn't look at more than one word. It's gonna look at the whole set.

528
00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:47.319
Anthony Taylor: And a lot of times with generative models. All they're really doing

529
00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:49.240
Anthony Taylor: is filling in the next work.

530
00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:56.830
Anthony Taylor: So you type a prompt blah blah blah. In fact, most of you, when you type your prompts don't just type the question.

531
00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:01.599
Anthony Taylor: and we'll talk about this in prompt engineering. But you can actually type like.

532
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:09.530
Anthony Taylor: Show me how I would write sequel that would do this and then write, select

533
00:53:10.290 --> 00:53:11.269
Anthony Taylor: and stop

534
00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:13.160
Anthony Taylor: select space. Stop!

535
00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:18.340
Anthony Taylor: That is really what it's designed to do.

536
00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:25.210
Anthony Taylor: It's designed to go. Oh, well, the next word after collect would be but and it would just go through the whole.

537
00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:30.280
Anthony Taylor: Okay? That makes them way more efficient.

538
00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:43.680
Anthony Taylor: So where are we now? Transform model process text and spoke words fed into the algorithm which extracts the data, breaks it into each element in individual words of phrases called tokenization. You're going to learn how to do that.

539
00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:58.469
Anthony Taylor: The algorithm classifies and labels each element that sounds like supervisor. It is not. It's not even clustering. Necessarily. Okay, using statistical training. The algorithm proposes the most likely meaning of the data.

540
00:53:59.690 --> 00:54:11.670
Anthony Taylor: Now, you're thinking to yourself, is it? Does that mean? It takes the words and goes well, that meant. Anthony talks too much. That's what that meant. Okay, not really.

541
00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:20.640
Anthony Taylor: What it does is it takes the words, it vectorizes them. Okay, by vectorizing it basically means it takes each word and turns it into a number.

542
00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:29.549
Anthony Taylor: Okay, takes those numbers and compares them to the context of the rest of the numbers around.

543
00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:40.480
Anthony Taylor: And then the next time somebody comes in and asks something that fits near, that it starts looking around it to come up with what next should come out of

544
00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:43.359
Anthony Taylor: alright it again.

545
00:54:43.610 --> 00:54:56.940
Anthony Taylor: We're going to do all this in class. I know you guys are like, this is crazy, all of this crazy stuff. Yeah. And he's promising. We're gonna do it in class. Yeah. I promise you will do everything I show you today.

546
00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:02.830
Anthony Taylor: Weeks. Oh, Sony's challenging. What? Sonya?

547
00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:03.960
Anthony Taylor: I

548
00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:15.879
sonja baro: not a challenge. Well, I'm just asking this one could you go back to the last because I didn't get to write down the last slide?

549
00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:20.650
Anthony Taylor: Well, I'm it helps me. I retain if I write. I like that. That's smart.

550
00:55:21.050 --> 00:55:28.390
sonja baro: So the transformer model process. Now I'm trying to remember what my question was or comment was.

551
00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:40.340
sonja baro: Really was I'm trying to think of is this like, when you have a foreign language in that foreign language.

552
00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:43.320
sonja baro: a single word can have multiple meanings.

553
00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:53.549
sonja baro: It just depends on how it's used and what's before and after it, or what end is on it. That type of thing is is that a fair comparison

554
00:55:54.010 --> 00:55:55.670
sonja baro: of that or.

555
00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:59.410
sonja baro: okay. So first off, the good news is you're on the right track.

556
00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:02.240
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And Nlp is how we do translation.

557
00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:06.600
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Now, again, old Nlp

558
00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:10.540
Anthony Taylor: was the one that if you said I want a taco

559
00:56:10.650 --> 00:56:19.169
Anthony Taylor: and told it to translate that into Korean it literally translated, I want a taco in the Korean in that order.

560
00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:24.239
sonja baro: and I shouldn't use Korean because I have no idea how to say I want to talk over Korean.

561
00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:28.350
Anthony Taylor: I don't know if I know how to taco. I can do it in Spanish.

562
00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:29.519
sonja baro: I mean.

563
00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:32.030
Anthony Taylor: okay, alright. So in Spanish.

564
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:48.169
Anthony Taylor: right? It's still kind of I want to tackle. But I don't know. Does anybody help me here? Anyway? The point is is now that we have the transformal transformer process translation. It's gotten significantly better.

565
00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:50.980
Anthony Taylor: Has anyone played with translation recently.

566
00:56:51.370 --> 00:56:56.720
Anthony Taylor: like all the new phones like, I have the Pixel 8 pro. And I mean, man, it's freaking. Tax

567
00:56:56.800 --> 00:57:02.340
Anthony Taylor: it. III didn't even realize. II turned on this thing. I saw this button said, Live caption.

568
00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:04.520
Anthony Taylor: I didn't think anything of it right.

569
00:57:04.530 --> 00:57:10.520
Anthony Taylor: That dang thing was translate every video into words, posting them on my screen

570
00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:12.250
Anthony Taylor: as it spoke them.

571
00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:17.639
Anthony Taylor: I mean, it was so flippant. I mean, it is, you know, top of the line phone at the moment. But

572
00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:23.669
Anthony Taylor: I mean it was, it's crazy. And that's all this. What you're seeing on the screen today?

573
00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:28.169
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it it takes the context of the English

574
00:57:28.310 --> 00:57:29.490
Anthony Taylor: phrase.

575
00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:33.530
Anthony Taylor: looks at the context of the Spanish phrase.

576
00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:38.320
Anthony Taylor: and goes, oh, you know what those, those, while they are in the same order, those go together

577
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:44.860
Anthony Taylor: return that right? So it has gotten significantly better and faster

578
00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:51.490
Anthony Taylor: because it's were correct. That makes any sense. But yeah.

579
00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:56.829
Anthony Taylor: oh, did I answer your question and look on your face. I'm not sure I answered the question.

580
00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:02.290
sonja baro: No, no, usually it's great. Thank you.

581
00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:17.990
Anthony Taylor: You guys are. Gonna learn this about me as we do this over time. Sometimes I go to answer questions, then I go on this story, and I go over here, and then I never get back to the question. So feel free to like, you know. Say, hey, that was great story. Now answer question, and I'll ask you what the question was, because I forgot.

582
00:58:18.210 --> 00:58:19.630
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright.

583
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:25.180
Anthony Taylor: continuing forward. So how are we using Lp models? Well, spam from legitimate. That's a big

584
00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:38.830
Anthony Taylor: okay. We look at the words we tokenize them. If this one has a lot of weird things or certain statements in it. Boom! It's gone alright, translating from one language to another. Thank you, Sonia. We already talked about

585
00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:47.269
Anthony Taylor: social media sentiment analysis. This is a big one. Do we use it? Not so much. Do the social media companies use it?

586
00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:48.790
Anthony Taylor: Absolutely

587
00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:52.060
Anthony Taylor: all right. Yes, click!

588
00:58:53.890 --> 00:58:54.870
Clayton Graves: Is that

589
00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:01.200
Anthony Taylor: buddy? Your mic is gold. Where is that?

590
00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:04.349
Clayton Graves: Is this? Is this better? There you go. That's better.

591
00:59:04.810 --> 00:59:06.130
Clayton Graves: So let's say I type.

592
00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:11.089
Anthony Taylor: Now, now you sound far away, but it's okay. I can hear you.

593
00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:17.679
Clayton Graves: I I'll have to put my other less fancy headphones on. But let's say you say,

594
00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:22.740
Clayton Graves: eat glass, right? I type out, eat glass to somebody

595
00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:24.660
Clayton Graves: on Facebook.

596
00:59:25.110 --> 00:59:26.170
Clayton Graves: and

597
00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:33.370
Clayton Graves: so am I, am I. So is is when you, when you talk about social media sentiment analysis.

598
00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:42.080
Clayton Graves: or is it trying to understand what I meant when I said that? Am I actually telling somebody to eat glass and injure themselves, or am I quoting Shits Creek?

599
00:59:42.330 --> 00:59:50.509
Anthony Taylor: That's a great question, and I don't know the answer, except only answer I can give you is it depends on how they

600
00:59:50.650 --> 00:59:55.090
Anthony Taylor: classified the terms. Eat glass each glass

601
00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:57.790
Anthony Taylor: if you do it so. And here's an interesting thing.

602
00:59:57.890 --> 01:00:01.750
Anthony Taylor: A few years ago eat glass would probably have gotten de flagged at all.

603
01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:07.690
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Because it would look. And it would look at glass. And it would go. Both those words are fine.

604
01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:12.070
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now, contextually speaking.

605
01:00:12.410 --> 01:00:14.370
Anthony Taylor: it might see those as aggressive.

606
01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:22.599
Anthony Taylor: Right? Because it sounds like you're you know, you're saying, you know, E. Glass, like it's like you tell you to harm yourself.

607
01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:27.829
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And even though that's just saying or just the quote

608
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:43.030
Anthony Taylor: it, you know. And and again, I can answer questions. I don't know the rules that you know Facebook, where all these guys put behind their sentiments analysis to say what would be considered offensive or inappropriate, or whatever

609
01:00:49.620 --> 01:01:07.340
Anthony Taylor: they train it. They look at what it's and they usually will custer it or they'll just have, you know, a bunch of people label it, and they'll say. you know. Okay. But now, every time the post comes in we're gonna run it through our model, and as long as it doesn't come back as flagged we're good to go.

610
01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:14.809
Anthony Taylor: So yeah. And then, of course, chat bots, virtual agents. We're gonna talk about them lots. We've already picked that one up.

611
01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:24.570
Anthony Taylor: So we'll move forward. Do good machine learning is awesome. That's what it says. I don't know why. Told me to sing

612
01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:26.840
so weird.

613
01:01:27.370 --> 01:01:32.649
Anthony Taylor:  Oh, hey! We got something we could do together.

614
01:01:33.150 --> 01:01:41.589
Anthony Taylor: How fun is that? Alright? So I'm gonna give you guys a link in slack. Yeah, rob me.

615
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:43.800
Masarirambi, Rodney: Sorry. Just

616
01:01:43.810 --> 01:01:46.530
Anthony Taylor: no, do not be sorry questions.

617
01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:47.910
Masarirambi, Rodney: So

618
01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:54.609
Masarirambi, Rodney: you've mentioned that with with the neural networks that we know that you put

619
01:01:54.630 --> 01:02:01.170
Masarirambi, Rodney: favoring the nodes, and so that, and nobody understands how we came up with the answers.

620
01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:04.220
Anthony Taylor: they're very difficult to come up with the answers, yes.

621
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:06.560
Masarirambi, Rodney: so

622
01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:09.060
Masarirambi, Rodney: we

623
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:19.050
Masarirambi, Rodney: has anybody. Awesome. Is this the right way to go? If we don't know how it works. We don't care.

624
01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:23.599
Masarirambi, Rodney: Rodney Rodney, do you know? Do you know.

625
01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:26.610
Anthony Taylor: you know? Hold on, I gotta find something crazy

626
01:02:26.810 --> 01:02:31.210
Anthony Taylor: you probably know you. You're smart, guy, aren't you?

627
01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:33.519
Anthony Taylor: Do you know how a video card works?

628
01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:37.699
Anthony Taylor: Don't explain it. Just say, do you? Or don't you?

629
01:02:37.790 --> 01:02:44.609
Anthony Taylor: And the answer is probably not in great detail, right? But you use that thing like crazy. Don't video graphics

630
01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:56.990
Anthony Taylor: right? But the idea that somebody knows and somebody put that together that that's the only Singapore. II know they don't, they truly don't. It's a black box.

631
01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:58.440
Anthony Taylor: It's a black box.

632
01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:08.629
Anthony Taylor:  There are. There are entire think, tanks, that their job is. Figure out how to get AI models and make them interpretable.

633
01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.290
Anthony Taylor: and how to make

634
01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:17.159
Anthony Taylor: no networks and turn. Now, here's the interesting thing. What you guys are. Gonna find out. Guess what AI models are built from

635
01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:19.300
Anthony Taylor: neural networks.

636
01:03:20.350 --> 01:03:30.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay, is it all built from your own network? So are we ever going to be able to really answer the question? Maybe maybe not. Did you have? Are you raising your hands on you?

637
01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:38.899
Anthony Taylor: Are you just waving at somebody in the house. Bye. see if you're okay. Alright. So I gave you guys a link.

638
01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:43.180
Anthony Taylor:  let's open that up together.

639
01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:45.340
Anthony Taylor: Oops.

644
01:04:01.770 --> 01:04:06.500
Anthony Taylor: alright. So over here, the input, it's gonna ask you to let you use your camera.

645
01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:11.639
Anthony Taylor:  I think you'll have to turn off your camera to make that happen.

646
01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:15.910
Anthony Taylor: Yep, you will. So everyone has permission.

647
01:04:15.930 --> 01:04:24.049
Anthony Taylor: Stop the video on Zoom. This is, I'm not gonna get the joy out of this. I want it. Refresh the page.

648
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:27.880
Masarirambi, Rodney: It's onward, for with both me.

649
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:29.700
Anthony Taylor: Oh, is it

650
01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:33.410
Anthony Taylor: so lucky if it's on it, you can see yourself.

651
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:35.699
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, it was working under camera.

652
01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:40.760
Anthony Taylor: Here, let me see. Wait, let me see my turn on my camera make it work.

653
01:04:41.770 --> 01:04:48.270
Anthony Taylor: A oh, you know what? Never mind, I know. What's going. Is that it?

654
01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:53.850
Anthony Taylor: Now see, it's not working for me. Yeah. Well, I feel bad now. But you guys can see my screen right?

655
01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:58.249
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, alright, that's all. There. She can see me on here.

656
01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:00.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so here's what we're gonna do.

657
01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:05.749
Anthony Taylor: We're going to train a model to recognize visual cues.

658
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:12.250
Anthony Taylor: So what we want you do is first, I want you to either raise or wade with your left hand

659
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:16.269
Anthony Taylor: and then push the train green button

660
01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:19.860
Anthony Taylor: and just let it run for like 5 s

661
01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:23.720
Anthony Taylor: and stop.

662
01:05:25.450 --> 01:05:29.459
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So we have assigned Train green to this key cat.

663
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:37.220
Anthony Taylor: Alright now, can't really do anything yet, because we only have the one. So now I want you to raise your right hand

664
01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:45.979
Anthony Taylor: and push the purple button. Now for those of us that are using their mouse that way. What I would do is come over here like the train. Purple.

665
01:05:48.450 --> 01:05:54.780
Anthony Taylor: Okay. now, last, but not least. I want you to just make a silly face

666
01:05:56.610 --> 01:05:59.039
Anthony Taylor: and push train orange ready. Go

667
01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:01.660
Anthony Taylor: and let go

668
01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:08.490
Anthony Taylor: alright. I did not get to see any silly faces. How disappointing

669
01:06:09.890 --> 01:06:16.760
Anthony Taylor: away Christine still doing right hand. Let's see if she so she makes silly things. Did it not work? Yeah, hold. But yeah, hold it, Christine.

670
01:06:21.590 --> 01:06:25.279
Anthony Taylor: Now, when you're done. you hold up your left hand.

671
01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:30.470
Anthony Taylor: The green button should go the green picture. You go up your right hand

672
01:06:33.050 --> 01:06:37.560
Anthony Taylor: the way I did it the Purple one should go. If you make a funny face.

673
01:06:40.030 --> 01:06:41.579
Anthony Taylor: The Bunny Rabinson show

674
01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:44.029

01:06:56.050 --> 01:07:08.539
Mason, Natalie: I'm still not sure how to even get my face in there. I turned off. You open yours and share with us.

677
01:07:10.590 --> 01:07:12.500

Anthony Taylor: And we've just trained a model.

719
01:10:25.670 --> 01:10:32.919
Anthony Taylor: This is a vision recognition. It is literally what you do and and act based on what you're doing on the other side. Okay?

720
01:10:33.610 --> 01:10:37.339
Anthony Taylor: And this is not nefarious. It's just a super, cool way to show.

721
01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:39.870
Anthony Taylor: Okay. everybody like that.

722
01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:45.440
Anthony Taylor: That was fun. It was way better than listen to me talk, let me tell you. Alright.

723
01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:56.519
Masarirambi, Rodney: So let me share it. We build about 3,000 trees. Right? Is that is that what? Now? Let's be really simple.

724
01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:59.590
Anthony Taylor: But you know, maybe

725
01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:01.699
Mason, Natalie: it's up that.

726
01:11:02.890 --> 01:11:05.619
Anthony Taylor: That one was really step, really step.

727
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:09.300
Anthony Taylor: In fact, it was probably all done in Javascript, which is, yeah.

728
01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:14.070
Anthony Taylor: You guys can come back on camera. Now stop playing with the thing. Yes, Mike.

729
01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:20.410
michael mcpherson: you're having a problem getting it your camera to turn back on close that pit website?

730
01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:22.010
Anthony Taylor: Yes.

731
01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:27.810
Anthony Taylor: absolutely, Natalie. You guys, okay, we're bringing the camera back up now.

732
01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:30.709
Anthony Taylor: It's almost break time already.

733
01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:39.930
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I'm working on that. Let's see. Just close the browser window and then push this the start. Video button on your zoom.

734
01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:53.049
Anthony Taylor: You'll be fine. We'll get there. Alright, gay! So we'll continue. We'll I know you're working on your camera. in fact, doing that to work on right now. Just pay attention and and

735
01:11:53.250 --> 01:11:57.960
Anthony Taylor: we'll get it. Okay. So AI found meetings.

736
01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:03.659
Anthony Taylor: Today's AI Foundation's lecture work section. We're going to cover Github.

737
01:12:03.850 --> 01:12:06.939
Anthony Taylor: the industry standard collaboration tool.

738
01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:15.260
Anthony Taylor: You will use Github to store your code, collaborate with your peers on projects and submit assignments.

739
01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:19.430
Anthony Taylor: Your first challenge assignment will be creating a repo with you.

740
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:26.169
Anthony Taylor: getting comfortable with Github is critical for your success at the food camp and post graduation.

741
01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:28.500
Anthony Taylor:  yeah.

742
01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:33.300
Anthony Taylor: it's funny in the data class. I always kind of follow that with, well. So

743
01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:36.010
Anthony Taylor: we don't typically use a lot of Github data.

744
01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:40.550
Anthony Taylor: But in AI AI is a little closer to an application.

745
01:12:40.610 --> 01:12:42.659
Anthony Taylor: The data, yeah, like

746
01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:44.549
Clayton Graves: is this, like

747
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:48.909
Clayton Graves: like bitbucket is. This is Github like bitbucket.

748
01:12:49.820 --> 01:13:06.560
Anthony Taylor:  I'm not positive. I think so. But get up is basically, I mean, well, we're gonna talk about it gives you like visual. So you can like merge your your, not a lot of visual. But you can do that with Vs code and Github.

749
01:13:06.610 --> 01:13:09.689
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I can show you all. But

750
01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:11.330
Anthony Taylor: I'm thinking.

751
01:13:11.970 --> 01:13:16.070
Anthony Taylor: hold on, I want. I'm thinking we should go on break before we continue.

752
01:13:16.690 --> 01:13:19.310
Anthony Taylor: because this is like a whole nother like thing.

753
01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:22.250
Anthony Taylor: and we're at almost 90'clock.

754
01:13:22.770 --> 01:13:25.520
Anthony Taylor: which means I'm way behind again. But that's alright.

755
01:13:26.090 --> 01:13:33.449
Anthony Taylor: I know you guys like here we talk a lot, so I'll just keep talking. But let's go ahead and take break come back at

756
01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:36.319
Anthony Taylor: page 5, 7, 45, right?

757
01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:39.419
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Hi, I'll see you guys at 80'clock.

758
01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:47.730
michael mcpherson: Alright, gang! We are back

759
01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:52.279
Anthony Taylor: back to mute. Go back to mute. Stop being social

760
01:13:52.710 --> 01:13:57.779
Anthony Taylor: kidding. We love everybody being social. How about Anthony shares a screen that would Google.

761
01:13:59.910 --> 01:14:01.380
Anthony Taylor: okay.

762
01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:05.870
Anthony Taylor: so now we're gonna get to put their hands on keyboard for a little bit.

763
01:14:06.010 --> 01:14:12.539
Anthony Taylor: Doing something important. Bit bucket. By the way, Clayton. Yeah, it's practically like the same dame thing

764
01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:18.730
Anthony Taylor: and it's probably really popular now, because it wasn't that long ago that Microsoft bought it up

765
01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:24.670
and Microsoft owns it, and you know everybody's like, oh, everything. Microsoft's involved with this evil

766
01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:29.740
Anthony Taylor:  except apparently chat gpts and say pretty much. I want to.

767
01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:31.640
Anthony Taylor: But

768
01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:33.990
Anthony Taylor: yeah.

769
01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:36.740
Anthony Taylor: So let's talk about Github.

770
01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:43.979
Anthony Taylor: So what is Github Github? So let's actually, you know what we we obviously have gamers.

771
01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:47.419
Anthony Taylor: Anybody in here. Never play a game ever in your life.

772
01:14:49.190 --> 01:14:51.130
Anthony Taylor: Alright good. So everybody has played a game.

773
01:14:51.380 --> 01:14:54.170
Anthony Taylor: Maybe I play a game recently last

774
01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:58.589
Anthony Taylor: 2 days. Anyway, it's not played a game in the last 2 days.

775
01:14:58.810 --> 01:15:00.939
Anthony Taylor: Okay, a few of you all right. Week

778
01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:08.739
michael mcpherson: if I now

779
01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:13.690
Anthony Taylor: bad? Something that you can press save on.

780
01:15:14.570 --> 01:15:17.959
Anthony Taylor: So how about a word document or an excel document?

781
01:15:18.730 --> 01:15:19.770
Anthony Taylor: All right. There.

782
01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:24.690
Anthony Taylor: So you're playing a game. You're typing your word, Doc. You're doing some cells

783
01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:28.770
Anthony Taylor: and get to a point. You're like, I'm gonna press, save right?

784
01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:34.250
Anthony Taylor: Okay, go a little bit further. Oh, no, mess up!

785
01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:47.539
Anthony Taylor: Oh, you can. Now go back to your save file. Right. open it back up, video game, go! And you're like that's fire. I'll never, you know, every time he's fine it's instantly dead.

786
01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:51.830
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Okay. Go back to my last, save. Okay.

787
01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:56.199
Anthony Taylor: Github is kind of like that.

788
01:15:57.330 --> 01:16:01.689
Anthony Taylor: Alright. When we create a repository

789
01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:06.519
Anthony Taylor: in Github, we're going to clone

790
01:16:06.650 --> 01:16:07.960
Anthony Taylor: it down

791
01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:10.799
Anthony Taylor: to our computer.

792
01:16:11.530 --> 01:16:13.470
Anthony Taylor: It's going to track

793
01:16:13.930 --> 01:16:19.959
Anthony Taylor: every change we make to every file that we have put into our repository.

794
01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:29.040
Anthony Taylor: When we say. Commit. that is the equivalent of pushing the save button.

795
01:16:30.610 --> 01:16:34.470
Anthony Taylor: Alright, so it will at that point, save where you are.

796
01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:44.519
Anthony Taylor: Now you continue work. Something happens. You can go back to that point or you continue working, and then you go. Oh, I need to save again commit

797
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:46.350
Anthony Taylor: saves it again.

798
01:16:47.150 --> 01:16:52.379
Anthony Taylor: Now you keep working, and you go to like test what you were doing. And oh, my God, it doesn't.

799
01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:56.050
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Well, it did work

800
01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:59.240
Anthony Taylor: in my last save so I can go back to there

801
01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:06.400
Anthony Taylor: and I start coding again. I realize you know what this is. Something I did wrong a long time ago, and I can go back to my first save

802
01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:15.230
Anthony Taylor: and start from there. And that's is one of the big points of git.

803
01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:17.160
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

804
01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:32.669
Anthony Taylor:  the other big thing. I mean, they talk about collaboration. And yes does allow us to collaborate because you can create this repository and be clear repository in this case is a web page that allows you to upload

805
01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:36.759
Anthony Taylor: or objects. Web pages, pictures

806
01:17:37.050 --> 01:17:38.940
Anthony Taylor: whatever. Okay.

807
01:17:39.850 --> 01:17:46.250
Anthony Taylor:  it's collaboration. Because I can say.

808
01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.850
Meredith

809
01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:54.170
Anthony Taylor: has her repository. She's working with Sonya and Gabriel.

810
01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:59.070
Anthony Taylor: and they're all working on a different piece.

811
01:17:59.630 --> 01:18:03.149
Anthony Taylor: and they're all saving to the same repository.

812
01:18:05.530 --> 01:18:07.329
Anthony Taylor: There you go collaboration.

813
01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:11.220
Anthony Taylor: They can comment. They can do all that. So so that's

814
01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:20.999
Anthony Taylor: what Github and Gith are all about. Github is really just a website where we can make web based repositories and bring them

815
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:22.379
Anthony Taylor: to our hard drive.

816
01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:26.430
Anthony Taylor: a very similar to get lab different, but similar.

817
01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:32.990
Anthony Taylor: So anyway, so this is the visual representation. When I look at this, I not get a comfy, warm feeling.

818
01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:37.609
Anthony Taylor: but version A, then version 2 is a one.

819
01:18:38.210 --> 01:18:40.679
Anthony Taylor: but version, one has an A, B and C

820
01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:46.909
Anthony Taylor: B. We didn't update till version 4. So now we have version 2 of A, one

821
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:53.429
Anthony Taylor: is now a 2, and then B, one becomes B, 2, while C, one and C 2. Just skip the version. 5

822
01:18:53.570 --> 01:18:54.459
Anthony Taylor: got it.

823
01:18:56.230 --> 01:18:58.750
Anthony Taylor: That was the stupidest diagram ever.

824
01:18:59.050 --> 01:19:06.609
Anthony Taylor: I'm not even sure how to explain this. So let me try again. Version one. We have. Let's say, we have 3 modules. Okay.

825
01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:15.740
Anthony Taylor: we have the controller module. the picture module and the chart month. Okay.

826
01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:20.529
Anthony Taylor: we need to fix the controller module and picture module.

827
01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:24.649
Anthony Taylor: But the whatever I call the middle one.

828
01:19:25.630 --> 01:19:32.809
Anthony Taylor: whatever does not need to be fixed. So we create a new version, and we make changes to A and change. B,

829
01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.639
Anthony Taylor: we don't change B, so we don't need to move it.

830
01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:39.630
Anthony Taylor: Perversion 3. We're like, Oh.

831
01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:45.840
Anthony Taylor: we need to make a change here, but nowhere else. So let's just make a new version with a new C,

832
01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:53.349
Anthony Taylor: and then here we only change A and B, but we left C and version 5 is, we only change B and C,

833
01:19:54.510 --> 01:19:55.480
Anthony Taylor: okay.

834
01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:59.380
Anthony Taylor: this is so much more complicated than anything

835
01:19:59.810 --> 01:20:04.570
Anthony Taylor: you're gonna do in this class. Alright, we're not gonna let you get this company.

836
01:20:05.010 --> 01:20:13.539
Anthony Taylor:  I have seen like application development areas, like where people are creating applications

837
01:20:13.810 --> 01:20:24.499
Anthony Taylor: where they get this complicated. Because typically when you create applications, you'll like assign different objects or different functionality to different people.

838
01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:29.089
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And there could be a hundred objects there could be a thousand of.

839
01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:34.190
Anthony Taylor: and each one of them have their own little piece of the coat.

840
01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:42.000
Anthony Taylor: and said some point we need to bring those in to a main branch and push the coat. That's complicated.

841
01:20:42.450 --> 01:20:45.809
Anthony Taylor: Unlikely. You guys will run into that. An AI,

842
01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:50.590
Anthony Taylor: maybe okay. And data pretty much. Never.

843
01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:52.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But

844
01:20:52.860 --> 01:21:04.979
Anthony Taylor: we do use get and get technologies pretty much across the board. We just don't get this company. Okay? Oh, so a commit.

845
01:21:04.990 --> 01:21:09.589
Anthony Taylor: So a commit, and I love the way they do this. I made some changes to these 5,

846
01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:17.660
Anthony Taylor: and here's why. So when you do a commit, there's a message you put in the message. And the message should basically be

847
01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:22.250
Anthony Taylor: why you made the change doesn't have to be what you change.

848
01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:31.680
Anthony Taylor: But maybe oh, I fixed this functionality. Or I, I added this new algorithm or change the parameters in our machine learning model.

849
01:21:33.010 --> 01:21:36.620
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And you would put that in here and that way

850
01:21:36.690 --> 01:21:42.010
Anthony Taylor: when you know, a week or 2 from now, when I go back to the Repository, if I have to go back

851
01:21:42.070 --> 01:21:47.999
Anthony Taylor: and say, Oh, it's not working. Right? Let's go back to this version. The comment is how we find the version.

852
01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:55.220
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you're not gonna keep track of the big, long number of users. It's not as friendly as 1, 2.

853
01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:57.399
Anthony Taylor: So a git, save

854
01:21:57.410 --> 01:22:03.919
Anthony Taylor: save game is called a commit. All right. So if we start, we have some code.

855
01:22:04.230 --> 01:22:06.099
Anthony Taylor: or maybe no code that met.

856
01:22:06.290 --> 01:22:13.059
Anthony Taylor: But let's say we start with some. and we create a branch or talk about what branches but branches effectively

857
01:22:13.490 --> 01:22:19.450
Anthony Taylor: a parallel path for our code. You know, everyone watches Marvel. Maybe it's a multiverse.

858
01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:22.280
Anthony Taylor: Okay. it's a parallel branch.

859
01:22:22.510 --> 01:22:34.020
Anthony Taylor: It's got the same. And the first dot here. There's pretty much everything that was here. everything. And then we start fearing off and creating new timelines.

860
01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:36.809
Anthony Taylor: I'm I'm going with this. I'm liking this.

861
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:43.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we have these 2 timelines. But then along comes the TVA.

862
01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:59.390
Anthony Taylor: And you only know what that is. If you watch Loki all right, and they need to fix the timeline. So basically, you have finished making your changes, and they have been tested. And you want to merge them back into the master timeline.

863
01:23:00.580 --> 01:23:06.279
Anthony Taylor: So you you commit. You make what's called a pool request.

864
01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:14.429
Anthony Taylor: and then whoever owes this repository, the gitmaster will come in and say.

865
01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:18.579
Anthony Taylor: Yes, we can bring this timeline into this time.

866
01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:23.660
Anthony Taylor: and then we bring it back into a single timing. Okay.

867
01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:27.120
Anthony Taylor: Hi, Tennessee Valley authority. What?

868
01:23:27.390 --> 01:23:28.350
michael mcpherson: And my

869
01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:30.800
Anthony Taylor: alright, hey? What's up?

870
01:23:31.570 --> 01:23:43.379
Clayton Graves: So the way that that I've always envisioned it is the branch is when they went back in time and took the affinity stones right?

871
01:23:43.610 --> 01:23:48.670
Clayton Graves: And it branches out, and when that branch goes back in.

872
01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:51.589
Clayton Graves: that's when Captain America returned. Them

873
01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:57.090
Anthony Taylor: wasn't an iron man when he did they return them.

874
01:23:57.690 --> 01:24:00.450
Anthony Taylor: But that's alright. Click! We all give.

875
01:24:01.570 --> 01:24:05.169
Anthony Taylor: Oh, my God! Did you just gather what?

876
01:24:08.350 --> 01:24:19.569
Anthony Taylor: Okay, anyway? Yes, that is it. So branches are typically dated like, if you have an application. It's working. And someone says, we need a new functionality.

877
01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:23.519
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we'll create a branch from the work code.

878
01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:31.620
Anthony Taylor: create the new functionality test the new functionality, and then merge it back into the master, which will then become

879
01:24:32.130 --> 01:24:35.500
Anthony Taylor: the the application. The next version of the application

880
01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:37.369
Anthony Taylor: alright again.

881
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:45.920
Anthony Taylor: Pretty elaborate discussion. you know, which you may or may not run into very often. but I'm glad you could still

882
01:24:46.050 --> 01:24:57.190
Anthony Taylor: so here's a scenario your group has been working on Ubers writer data. And you've decided to analyze the average age of writers. The root code for this project is called Main.

883
01:24:57.410 --> 01:24:59.189
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's the master branch.

884
01:24:59.290 --> 01:25:02.909
Anthony Taylor: And so you create a version. Well, what are they doing here?

885
01:25:03.110 --> 01:25:13.999
Anthony Taylor: Remote repository? That's on Github. The staging areas where you edit the files would be part of the next commit. So you bring it down to your local computer. So you do a clone. We're gonna do that in a minute.

886
01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:15.410
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

887
01:25:15.470 --> 01:25:25.450
Anthony Taylor: And that brings it to the computer. That's where you do work. That's where you do the commit. It doesn't go back up to the remote repository until you do a push

888
01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:29.390
Anthony Taylor: you can commit 1,000 times

889
01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:34.329
Anthony Taylor: unlimited number of times. Okay, on your local computer.

890
01:25:34.690 --> 01:25:38.820
Anthony Taylor: But until once you do a push, it pushes that last commit

891
01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:40.330
Anthony Taylor: up together.

892
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:49.650
Anthony Taylor: Okay. that's important. Oh, so continuing allows us to write the code and save it

893
01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:51.999
Anthony Taylor: locally on our computer. Git, commit.

894
01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:54.759
Anthony Taylor: Oh, these are cute little pictures. I like this

895
01:25:54.880 --> 01:26:01.379
Anthony Taylor: and then we can do a push and push it up to get up to get help.

896
01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:07.540
Anthony Taylor: which is in the Internet. Okay? And then. did they even talk about it?

897
01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:16.040
Anthony Taylor: The update should be added to the main branch. Would they merge? So if things go particularly well, and I hope they do for you guys.

898
01:26:16.710 --> 01:26:21.650
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you won't have any merge conflicts. Merge conflicts are awful.

899
01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:24.699
Anthony Taylor: There are no fun, and they happen all the time.

900
01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:31.979
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if you guys listen to me and follow my directions, and don't try to do it your own way

901
01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:39.350
Anthony Taylor: until you understand it better. You will not have a merge conflict. and life will be wonderful

902
01:26:39.930 --> 01:26:44.089
Anthony Taylor: if you would like. I will help you by creating a merge conflict.

903
01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:46.200
Anthony Taylor: and let you try to figure it out.

904
01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:50.109
Anthony Taylor: I'll walk you through it, but only to a certain point, because I hate

905
01:26:51.490 --> 01:27:02.280
Anthony Taylor: no birds. Conflicts are particularly difficult with with notebooks, and that's a lot of work going to be doing some notebooks. So anyway, that's it. Okay, I will tell you how to avoid.

906
01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:12.399
Anthony Taylor: So these are the commands we're gonna learn today. Get clone, get, add, get, connect, get pushed, get, pull. You learn these things. You know everything you will probably ever need to know about using.

907
01:27:12.510 --> 01:27:13.420
Anthony Taylor: Get

908
01:27:13.950 --> 01:27:18.739
Anthony Taylor: okay, so commit and get up. That's you're saying it again. It's like the same.

909
01:27:19.370 --> 01:27:22.389
Anthony Taylor: It's not break time. We just had our break.

910
01:27:22.690 --> 01:27:24.320
Anthony Taylor: Hi, so

911
01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:35.770
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to give you a demo. And then I'm gonna let you guys do the same thing. So don't do what I do yet. please.

912
01:27:37.210 --> 01:27:38.600
Anthony Taylor: Yes, Andy.

913
01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:41.129
sonja baro: quick question.

914
01:27:41.250 --> 01:27:45.850
sonja baro: So the commit. When you do get commit it.

915
01:27:45.870 --> 01:27:48.939
sonja baro: It's in your local repository.

916
01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:54.989
sonja baro: Correct. So I've clone my repo, and I bring it, and I bring it down.

917
01:27:55.140 --> 01:28:01.150
sonja baro: And I committed for the the first time to like.

918
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:02.840
Anthony Taylor: It's whatever's in there.

919
01:28:03.070 --> 01:28:12.319
sonja baro: Okay? And then I commit, and then I go, and I make changes, and it doesn't go back until I push or do I have to commit? Okay.

920
01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:19.400
Anthony Taylor: you always have to commit before you push. The good news is most of the time. When you try to push, it'll tell you you should commit

921
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:28.610
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna walk through how to see other. This actually, one more command. They don't mentioned that I'm gonna do. So you guys are all welcome. Come to my repository.

922
01:28:28.770 --> 01:28:33.380
Anthony Taylor: It is filled with lots of fun stuff that you're going to enjoy at some point.

923
01:28:33.540 --> 01:28:38.029
Anthony Taylor: It also has a bunch of stuff that are really just Demos.

924
01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:41.630
Anthony Taylor: For this demo I'm about to do right now, live

925
01:28:41.770 --> 01:28:45.320
Anthony Taylor: any name you like. Guess how that went.

926
01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:49.169
Anthony Taylor: I said, create a repo. Give it any name you like.

927
01:28:51.550 --> 01:28:54.909
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so anyway, that's what we're gonna do. So going back

928
01:28:55.020 --> 01:29:00.070
Anthony Taylor: to our homepage, you should see something like this. If you just got here.

929
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:11.230
Anthony Taylor: it may look more like this. Okay, it just depends. Most of you don't have a lot over here on the left. Don't worry about it. You will.

930
01:29:11.610 --> 01:29:21.879
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna start with, let's create a new repository. So if you're on this screen, you can just click this new button right here.

931
01:29:23.690 --> 01:29:36.009
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And it's gonna take you. No, I just want you to watch. You're welcome to do it.

932
01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:40.740
Anthony Taylor:  So we're not going to use any templates. Anything like that.

933
01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:46.640
Anthony Taylor: In my case I have more than one, so I get to queue the owner, so I'll use my main

934
01:29:47.070 --> 01:29:50.689
Anthony Taylor: my main name, which is Lord of Etl.

935
01:29:51.650 --> 01:29:55.569
Anthony Taylor: Don't make fun of me. It used to be lord of data.

936
01:29:56.220 --> 01:30:02.089
Clayton Graves: Okay. And now, following you, you saw mine.

937
01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:06.229
Clayton Graves: What is yours, Lord Etl. Lord Graves.

938
01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:18.999
Anthony Taylor: Oh, that's a good one, too. Well, Lord Etl came from I they used to call me the Lord data, and then I started working on something, and as Laura and me, I said, I'm not gonna be Lord data anymore. That's I'm gonna be Lord Etl.

939
01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:22.040
Anthony Taylor: and I've had that stupid name forever.

940
01:30:23.050 --> 01:30:26.869
Anthony Taylor:  I used to have the domain. But I got rid of.

941
01:30:27.090 --> 01:30:32.379
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Repository name needs to be unique to your

942
01:30:33.490 --> 01:30:37.930
Anthony Taylor: subscription. Okay? So I can't use any name I like.

943
01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:45.460
Anthony Taylor: Alright, but I could just make one. So I'll do a demo for AI. Okay?

944
01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:50.459
Anthony Taylor: And it says, Here, that's available. So I'm good. Go. Don't push any buttons

945
01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:57.699
Anthony Taylor: next description. This is optional. I recommend you put something in here. This is my first

946
01:30:58.430 --> 01:30:59.190
repo.

947
01:31:01.710 --> 01:31:05.100
Anthony Taylor: public or private. Now I have some private ones.

948
01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:11.080
Anthony Taylor: Public. If you're gonna share with anybody in the group, or you're going to submit homework.

949
01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:12.659
Anthony Taylor: you need it to be public.

950
01:31:13.130 --> 01:31:19.819
Anthony Taylor: Okay, private, you'd have to actually, specifically give people permission. You don't know which grader is gonna be grading. So

951
01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:32.130
Anthony Taylor: it's basically going to be public always at a read me, it's not a requirement. It's just a really good idea. Okay. for the get ignored. So

952
01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:37.279
Anthony Taylor: a lot of programming languages, including python create

953
01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:38.500
Anthony Taylor: duff.

954
01:31:39.810 --> 01:31:43.640
Anthony Taylor: And the stuff is not important to your code base.

955
01:31:44.110 --> 01:31:45.930
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So

956
01:31:46.110 --> 01:31:53.680
Anthony Taylor: we can come in here. And since most of the work we're going to be doing is in python, we're going to click on this. And in the filter

957
01:31:53.950 --> 01:31:55.929
Anthony Taylor: type, PY.

958
01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:59.150
Anthony Taylor: And you will see python and click python.

959
01:32:01.050 --> 01:32:11.510
Anthony Taylor: All this is gonna do is put a file into your repository that says, Hey, all this stuff that python's creating, that you don't need. Just ignore it.

960
01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:18.220
Anthony Taylor: Don't put it back up on the Internet. cause. It's just gonna take up space and and make your repository up.

961
01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:23.419
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you could also update that and add other things. If you need to

962
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:33.249
Anthony Taylor: do not worry about license. None of us are making any license software at this point. So just move on once that's done, create the repository.

963
01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:36.650
Anthony Taylor: This should go very quickly, and then you have

964
01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:39.239
Anthony Taylor: this. So you'll be in a repository.

965
01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:41.700
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

966
01:32:42.630 --> 01:32:46.020
Anthony Taylor: now, I'm going to open my terminal.

967
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:51.479
Anthony Taylor: Everybody feel free to join a lot. If you want still in demo mode right now.

968
01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:58.060
Anthony Taylor:  I'm not gonna switch to get past, cause I don't want to.

969
01:32:59.150 --> 01:33:03.790
Anthony Taylor: but you could for those of you. If if you type GIT.

970
01:33:04.210 --> 01:33:09.100
Anthony Taylor: Space, dash B, and it doesn't give you an answer similar to this.

971
01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:11.410
Anthony Taylor: raise your hand.

972
01:33:12.530 --> 01:33:13.830
Anthony Taylor: leave it at the screen.

973
01:33:16.570 --> 01:33:21.890
Anthony Taylor: Everybody's good with this. I'm gonna be so impressed

974
01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:23.919
Tania Raugewitz: I thought we were in demo mode

975
01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:27.549
Anthony Taylor: we are. But you can still do it. Just this.

976
01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:32.399
michael mcpherson: Hold on. I got a couple of thumbs.

977
01:33:33.330 --> 01:33:34.519
Anthony Taylor: I'm sorry, Mike.

978
01:33:37.770 --> 01:33:40.210
michael mcpherson: I got a bunch of different command prompts open.

979
01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:42.470
Anthony Taylor: You only need one.

980
01:33:43.850 --> 01:33:46.989
michael mcpherson: How's going?

981
01:33:47.770 --> 01:33:49.340
Anthony Taylor: Oh, I'm sorry.

982
01:33:50.630 --> 01:33:53.709
Anthony Taylor: Bryan, you raise your hand. Was that a good? Yes, you're good

983
01:33:56.670 --> 01:33:58.470
Masarirambi, Rodney: no. So

984
01:33:58.740 --> 01:34:00.820
Masarirambi, Rodney: once these 2 are entered.

985
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:07.170
Masarirambi, Rodney: yeah, II gotta wants me to do my itunes xcode an SDK license.

986
01:34:08.150 --> 01:34:13.360
Anthony Taylor: Okay, do, do you have? Oh, your term? Oh. Kev, what's he got to do?

987
01:34:16.210 --> 01:34:17.910
Kevin Nguyen: Let me see.

988
01:34:18.970 --> 01:34:23.449
Anthony Taylor: Oh, you want him to share? Oh, I didn't mean for this to be a sharing.

989
01:34:27.570 --> 01:34:30.310
Anthony Taylor: Go ahead, share for us, Rodney. Show us what's going on.

990
01:34:30.990 --> 01:34:34.930
Gebrekristos, Hafton: Does it have to be the same version as yours. I have 2.4 1.

991
01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:39.979
Anthony Taylor: No, it does not need to be saved.

992
01:34:40.530 --> 01:34:41.210
Okay.

993
01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:50.209
Anthony Taylor: yeah. As long as it returns something that means you're installed properly. Rodney, did you share Mike? I see your hand. But let's work. Let's get running down.

994
01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:52.759
Masarirambi, Rodney: Is anybody else having issues

995
01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:57.549
Masarirambi, Rodney: I'm trying to share. But I'm not getting any.

996
01:34:58.630 --> 01:35:02.119
Masarirambi, Rodney: thank you. I'm getting the weirdest like, it's not.

997
01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:16.760
Masarirambi, Rodney: It's yeah. That's that's weird. You're not getting the usual share options. Let me see if I can just do desktop. I'm just going to do desktop, too. That's sorry us do the desktop.

998
01:35:19.010 --> 01:35:21.169
Anthony Taylor: We won't look at all your other icons up.

999
01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:25.489
Masarirambi, Rodney: No, no, it's just. It's literally just the

1000
01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:32.670
Masarirambi, Rodney: it's it's not doing it. I I don't know if I need to quit Zoom. But I

1001
01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:34.459
Masarirambi, Rodney: yeah, I'm not still wearing.

1002
01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:38.469
Masarirambi, Rodney: Yeah, I'm getting like exclamation marks with everything.

1003
01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:44.610
Anthony Taylor: Well, what was the what was the the what was the return again. Something about X code. Kit.

1004
01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:54.099
Masarirambi, Rodney: Yeah. So it's it's something. So says something. That I've got to greet the expo license. You might have to every time

1005
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:57.709
Kevin Nguyen: it takes a long time, though it takes like 15 min

1006
01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:01.350
Kevin Nguyen: or more, so maybe we could do it after class, or you could we could do it before tomorrow.

1007
01:36:01.860 --> 01:36:08.519
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so you're alright. Today you're in watch move. It's alright. It's gonna be awesome, Rodney. Don't worry.

1008
01:36:08.660 --> 01:36:10.749
Anthony Taylor: Mike. What's the question, sir.

1009
01:36:19.730 --> 01:36:21.250
Anthony Taylor: you're muted, Mike.

1010
01:36:22.540 --> 01:36:25.869
Anthony Taylor: You weren't muted. But now you're muted. There you go.

1011
01:36:26.130 --> 01:36:33.630
michael mcpherson: Mine's 2.4 2.0. That's fine. That just means you got you guys installed it after I installed them. It's totally good.

1012
01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:38.080
Anthony Taylor: All right. Everybody else. Right now, you're okay. Yeah.

1013
01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:41.039
Anthony Taylor: awesome. Okay. Back to share.

1014
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:47.169
Anthony Taylor: Rodney. We will take care of you do not concern, and the good news is not complicated stuff.

1015
01:36:47.570 --> 01:36:50.230
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So now that I have

1016
01:36:50.410 --> 01:36:59.089
Anthony Taylor: the terminal that I have tested. I'm going to go up here to my repo. So we're gonna call her from now on, because we are the cool kids.

1017
01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:02.069
Anthony Taylor: Okay, the repo.

1018
01:37:02.710 --> 01:37:04.680
Anthony Taylor: And we're going to push this green button.

1019
01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:13.780
Anthony Taylor: and you can actually pick ssh, just, I don't care. Ssh is typically considered better. It doesn't work. Come back and pick https.

1020
01:37:13.970 --> 01:37:16.080
Anthony Taylor: Okay,

1021
01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:17.200
Anthony Taylor: copy.

1022
01:37:18.260 --> 01:37:20.770
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to type. Git

1023
01:37:21.630 --> 01:37:27.800
Anthony Taylor: clone. And you don't need to do this right now. But you're going to, and we're going to paste and hit enter.

1024
01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:36.470
Anthony Taylor: So what has just happened? It has closed all of the objects

1025
01:37:36.710 --> 01:37:42.909
Anthony Taylor: in my repository to my local drive. I can. I know this because I can type

1026
01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:44.900
Anthony Taylor: change Directory

1027
01:37:45.990 --> 01:37:48.930
Anthony Taylor: Demo for AI

1028
01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:51.750
Anthony Taylor: and hit enter and then list.

1029
01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:57.680
Anthony Taylor: And oh, sorry I'm not in that directory and see I have it. Ignore it reading.

1030
01:37:58.410 --> 01:37:59.990
Anthony Taylor: I will actually

1031
01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:11.899
Anthony Taylor: open it this way. Okay. now, on my screen, I have 2 files that you may not see when you do this, because they would be hidden files

1032
01:38:12.490 --> 01:38:23.459
Anthony Taylor: for my windows. Users. I don't know how to do this on that are my windows users. I want you to hit view so, and then make sure you have hidden items checked

1033
01:38:23.950 --> 01:38:29.810
Anthony Taylor: as well as filing extensions. Otherwise your screen will look more like

1034
01:38:31.890 --> 01:38:32.810
Anthony Taylor: that.

1035
01:38:33.770 --> 01:38:37.029
Anthony Taylor: There's nothing wrong with that. But yeah, I don't.

1036
01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:41.090
Anthony Taylor: So file name extensions

1037
01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:44.889
Anthony Taylor: and midnight

1038
01:38:46.190 --> 01:38:54.730
Anthony Taylor: when I see. So sometimes some of you will say I'm doing a get committed. Nothing's working, and I'll look, and I'll say, Show me your directory, and you won't have this file.

1039
01:38:54.930 --> 01:39:00.589
Anthony Taylor: And then I know this is not a git repository. because everything happens in. Git.

1040
01:39:00.630 --> 01:39:02.499
Anthony Taylor: it's stored in that full.

1041
01:39:04.150 --> 01:39:08.889
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. So here we are. So now I'm gonna right. Click inside of here.

1042
01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:13.509
Anthony Taylor: And I'm going to go to Vs code. Now, if you don't have this cool option

1043
01:39:13.670 --> 01:39:22.529
Anthony Taylor: bummer. but I will show you how to get to it. Okay? So what you would do is just open Vs code.

1044
01:39:23.310 --> 01:39:34.550
Anthony Taylor: and at the top here you would do file open folder. and then you would go to wherever that folder is stored.

1045
01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:41.180
Anthony Taylor: and put that in here.

1046
01:39:42.970 --> 01:39:50.300
Anthony Taylor: Enter and then do select folder. Okay, either one works the right click. One is way better.

1047
01:39:50.410 --> 01:39:56.659
Anthony Taylor: only because it's just super convenient. Okay? So now here we are.

1048
01:39:56.990 --> 01:40:03.439
Anthony Taylor: We're in our repository. So what are we gonna do first? Well, first, I'm going to add a file

1049
01:40:03.650 --> 01:40:04.870
Anthony Taylor: of.

1050
01:40:04.990 --> 01:40:10.170
Anthony Taylor: and I'll call it a file dot text. And I'll say, this is

1051
01:40:10.890 --> 01:40:13.269
Anthony Taylor: my first entry.

1052
01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:17.029
Anthony Taylor: I'm I'm typing faster than I'm talking.

1053
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:23.400
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and I saved it. Now the cool thing about Vs code Vs code is a lot of

1054
01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:25.040
Anthony Taylor: capabilities.

1055
01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:31.879
Anthony Taylor: Alright, it can tell us it's actually telling me that this file is new

1056
01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:34.359
Anthony Taylor: and it's been updated.

1057
01:40:35.450 --> 01:40:44.279
Anthony Taylor: I can see this by the color. I can see this by the U. In fact, if I click over here. I can even see that it's been changed.

1058
01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:55.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now we're gonna come back to this. But for right now let's stay in here. So I'm back in here and I do directory. And

1059
01:40:57.100 --> 01:41:03.779
Anthony Taylor: and I can now see, I have that file. So here's the next command. What was the first command we learned.

1060
01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:16.260
Anthony Taylor: get, get close. Okay. So now I'm gonna type. Get status.

1061
01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:26.799
Anthony Taylor: Now, what get status tells me is what's going on in my repository right now. Now, the cool thing about git status

1062
01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:30.820
Anthony Taylor: is not only does it tell me I have an untracked file.

1063
01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:44.709
Anthony Taylor: it tells me how to add it, what I should do. so I need to add this file to my track. Now there are 2 ways to do it. One you can do, get. Add, then, type the whole file name.

1064
01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:48.500
Anthony Taylor: or you can do it my favorite way. Get

1065
01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:56.689
Anthony Taylor: add space period. That will add all of these untracked files to our repository.

1066
01:41:58.190 --> 01:41:58.970
Anthony Taylor: And

1067
01:42:00.620 --> 01:42:02.079
Anthony Taylor: now, how do I know I didn't

1068
01:42:03.110 --> 01:42:05.740
Anthony Taylor: anybody want. Guess? What should I type? You already know it.

1069
01:42:10.010 --> 01:42:13.790
Anthony Taylor: Go ahead, Curry. I see it. You wanted to push, unmute.

1070
01:42:14.650 --> 01:42:15.890
Curry Gardner: get status.

1071
01:42:16.350 --> 01:42:17.650
Anthony Taylor: get status.

1072
01:42:18.890 --> 01:42:26.070
Anthony Taylor: Okay? It looks different now. Right? This says your branch is up to date with origin main. So that means we're up to date with the

1073
01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:31.450
Anthony Taylor: the main branch. and we haven't changed, and we have this new file.

1074
01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:38.429
Anthony Taylor: And what do we want to do with? Well, it literally says, changes to be committed.

1075
01:42:39.950 --> 01:42:43.230
Anthony Taylor: Alright, so don't be afraid of commitment.

1076
01:42:44.330 --> 01:42:46.730
Anthony Taylor: Gibbs commit.

1077
01:42:47.710 --> 01:42:50.120
Anthony Taylor: And now we need a message dash. M.

1078
01:42:50.490 --> 01:42:51.500
Anthony Taylor: Quotes

1079
01:42:51.890 --> 01:42:53.950
Anthony Taylor: my first

1080
01:42:54.150 --> 01:42:56.670
Anthony Taylor: commit end quote.

1081
01:42:58.830 --> 01:42:59.840
Anthony Taylor: Answer.

1082
01:43:00.810 --> 01:43:13.130
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So now I gave this more information. So some of this stuff don't worry about this is like what's going on in the background. But it basically it put this message, says one file is changed, and it was added

1083
01:43:15.010 --> 01:43:17.389
Anthony Taylor: alright, and then there we go.

1084
01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:22.059
Anthony Taylor: Now, let's go back to Github

1085
01:43:22.130 --> 01:43:34.279
Anthony Taylor: and see if it's there. Take a vote before I refresh the page. Is it gonna be there? Curry says, no. Jennifer says, baby. Yeah. Ronnie says, Yeah. alright. Well.

1086
01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:38.449
Anthony Taylor: we are actually missing a step.

1087
01:43:38.750 --> 01:43:41.390
sonja baro: It's not there. Yeah, push it.

1088
01:43:42.010 --> 01:43:44.730
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, yeah, push it poochy

1089
01:43:44.870 --> 01:43:50.280
Anthony Taylor: real good. There you go. Gotta push. I always stick that in my head.

1090
01:43:50.300 --> 01:43:51.910
Anthony Taylor: So now that we have

1091
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:56.590
Anthony Taylor: create, and we have made something we have committed. So we did a save.

1092
01:43:57.210 --> 01:43:59.040
Anthony Taylor: Now we can do a push.

1093
01:44:00.530 --> 01:44:09.859
Anthony Taylor: Actually, we could even do a status just to see where we are. I have nothing to commit. Everything looks good. Oh, but wait! Something has changed. You guys see what changed

1094
01:44:09.900 --> 01:44:16.400
Anthony Taylor: up here said. We're up to date now. It says we are ahead

1095
01:44:16.730 --> 01:44:19.879
Anthony Taylor: of origin, name by one bit.

1096
01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:22.620
Anthony Taylor: and the only way to fix that

1097
01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.300
Anthony Taylor: get push. Answer.

1098
01:44:27.210 --> 01:44:32.959
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now, as you can see if everything is set up properly. This just pushed it up to

1099
01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:39.520
Anthony Taylor: our repository, which now, when we refresh just like magic, it's now there.

1100
01:44:41.340 --> 01:44:43.960
Anthony Taylor: Okay. pretty cool.

1101
01:44:44.990 --> 01:44:47.750
Anthony Taylor: alright alternatives.

1102
01:44:50.310 --> 01:44:53.679
Anthony Taylor: Boot camp rule number one for curriculum.

1103
01:44:54.420 --> 01:44:56.959
Anthony Taylor: Show them the hard way first

1104
01:44:57.190 --> 01:45:01.729
Anthony Taylor: that way. They really like you when you show them the easy way.

1105
01:45:02.540 --> 01:45:07.720
Anthony Taylor: particularly after you've made them do it like 500 times the hard way.

1106
01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:13.339
Anthony Taylor: Then show them easy. Well, I'm not gonna do that. I did show you the hard way. That was the hard.

1107
01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:23.119
Anthony Taylor: okay, the easy way I can come. Well, there's a couple of easy ways. There's this easy way, which is stupid, easy, but I wouldn't recommend it. Very often.

1108
01:45:23.220 --> 01:45:27.140
Anthony Taylor: You can actually create a new file right here. Hi.

1109
01:45:28.660 --> 01:45:31.550
Anthony Taylor: this is a file created

1110
01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:37.170
Anthony Taylor: on the web. Okay. if you like it.

1111
01:45:38.010 --> 01:45:41.429
Anthony Taylor: you can preview what it looks like edit.

1112
01:45:41.570 --> 01:45:42.910
Anthony Taylor: And then.

1113
01:45:43.290 --> 01:45:45.669
Anthony Taylor: oh, we gotta give it a name.

1114
01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:51.830
Anthony Taylor: web, file dot text and commit changes.

1115
01:45:52.190 --> 01:45:56.409
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you could give it a nice comment. Whatever you want commit.

1116
01:45:56.740 --> 01:45:59.360
Anthony Taylor: and it has been committed. We refresh

1117
01:46:00.510 --> 01:46:02.880
Anthony Taylor: and look at that. It's there question.

1118
01:46:03.460 --> 01:46:06.759
Anthony Taylor: is this gonna be in my local folder on my hard drive?

1119
01:46:09.510 --> 01:46:18.009
Anthony Taylor: It's not right, but it should be Clayton's. Clayton's right. It should be there. But it's not because there is one more step

1120
01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:25.190
Anthony Taylor: every day that you guys are working in the repo during projects. The first thing you're going to do

1121
01:46:25.310 --> 01:46:27.960
Anthony Taylor: get Paul.

1122
01:46:29.310 --> 01:46:35.199
Anthony Taylor: Run it now get fool! Said, hey! We have a new file.

1123
01:46:37.460 --> 01:46:50.660
Clayton Graves: We just added it to your folder. Let's go look in my folder wham it's right there. Just think about it like this. Guys get clone pulls the entire repository right? It pulls everything. Only do that. Once

1124
01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:57.020
Clayton Graves: get pulled. Postage changes that have been made since the last time you cloned it or polled

1125
01:46:58.040 --> 01:47:14.270
Anthony Taylor: correct. But do be aware it can overwrite your changes if you change the same thing. So be aware that usually it'll tell. Okay. Alright. So that was and easy way. But you had to do that stupid git, pull thing right, which we're going to do anyway. But

1126
01:47:14.380 --> 01:47:17.490
Anthony Taylor: there is yet an easier way still.

1127
01:47:18.820 --> 01:47:21.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Vs code

1128
01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:32.370
Anthony Taylor: is the end. All tool of all tools. Alright. So here's what we're going to do. We're going to create another file, in fact, cancel that I'm going to create a folder

1129
01:47:32.630 --> 01:47:35.160
Anthony Taylor:  stuff

1130
01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:40.720
Anthony Taylor: folder in that folder. I'm gonna create file

1131
01:47:41.550 --> 01:47:45.570
Anthony Taylor: another file dot text.

1132
01:47:46.190 --> 01:47:48.590
Anthony Taylor: And in here I'm gonna say,

1133
01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:52.570
Anthony Taylor: gonna commit from vs, code.

1134
01:47:53.860 --> 01:47:59.180
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I'm gonna save it. So here we go again. Everything color coded. It turns green.

1135
01:47:59.370 --> 01:48:04.839
Anthony Taylor: Says it's gonna update. Now, I'm gonna go over here to this cool thing. If you notice it says source control

1136
01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:12.449
Anthony Taylor: there's there's other information on the screen. As we do this, you can see right now we're in the main branch.

1137
01:48:13.550 --> 01:48:14.560
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1138
01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:22.549
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to click on this. I see this here. I'm going to put in a message first. Commit from Bs code

1139
01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:24.260
Anthony Taylor: type. Commit.

1140
01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:29.479
It says, would you like to stage it first. So remember the get ad

1141
01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:32.590
Anthony Taylor: that was staging.

1142
01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:41.580
Anthony Taylor: Well, there is no git. Add here. I mean, technically, I could just push this button, but I can just say, you know what? Get it? It'll add whatever's in this area.

1143
01:48:41.630 --> 01:48:49.459
Anthony Taylor: So yeah, always do that. So now it has timidity. But now down here at the bottom. Something has changed.

1144
01:48:50.410 --> 01:48:53.429
Anthony Taylor: It's showing 0 down one up.

1145
01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:55.959
Anthony Taylor: which means

1146
01:48:55.980 --> 01:49:02.129
Anthony Taylor: there's nothing new up on on the the Github Repository, but I've got something.

1147
01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:11.000
Anthony Taylor: So if I want to push it, I can either click here, I can click sync changes. I can go in here and do push

1148
01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:13.970
Anthony Taylor: all of these options.

1149
01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:25.139
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we'll just pick one for right now, actually. this button will be here. You can use it. I want to do it down here, because if you didn't see this, or if you were like in this screen.

1150
01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:26.649
Anthony Taylor: this is still here.

1151
01:49:27.110 --> 01:49:32.549
Anthony Taylor: So you click that it'll say you want to push and pull. You say, yeah, don't show me that again.

1152
01:49:33.310 --> 01:49:39.980
Anthony Taylor: and then it'll take a second. Now, when we go back to our repository refresh.

1153
01:49:40.070 --> 01:49:43.759
Anthony Taylor: we have a folder, and in our folder there is a file.

1154
01:49:45.580 --> 01:49:49.800
Clayton Graves: This is awesome before this is, this is great.

1155
01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:52.089
Anthony Taylor: It is very handy.

1156
01:49:52.710 --> 01:49:54.640
Anthony Taylor: Okay,

1157
01:49:54.660 --> 01:50:04.110
Anthony Taylor: Other things you can do in here that are kind of interesting. We can say more stuff. save it.

1158
01:50:04.270 --> 01:50:07.480
Anthony Taylor: We have tools that will allow us

1159
01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:13.329
Anthony Taylor: to look at what the history of this file is, oh.

1160
01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:14.930
Anthony Taylor: I like that one's not working.

1161
01:50:15.170 --> 01:50:20.420
Anthony Taylor: Where's my get Lensx inspect?

1162
01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:33.139
Anthony Taylor: I don't need you guys to know how to do this stuff. But basically I can look at this and see who originally committed it. What changes they made over time to do all this. It's like a lineage of how we got

1163
01:50:33.950 --> 01:50:36.059
Anthony Taylor: all right. Very, very cool thing.

1164
01:50:36.910 --> 01:50:38.290
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1165
01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:42.410
Anthony Taylor: I think I've beat that near to death.

1166
01:50:44.150 --> 01:50:48.699
Anthony Taylor: Okay, final. Get snapshot model slack out. Link pro get book.

1167
01:50:48.910 --> 01:50:50.299
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna give you this link

1168
01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:59.040
Anthony Taylor: alright. Any questions you guys feel totally lost or totally like that was interesting. But I'm well.

1169
01:50:59.710 --> 01:51:05.549
Anthony Taylor: Is that where you are. How about this? This is one of the the the school's favorite things to do. Fifth of 5.

1170
01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:08.220
Anthony Taylor: What that means is one.

1171
01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:16.960
Anthony Taylor: I don't even know why I'm here. 5. I know this as well as him. Okay. somewhere in between.

1172
01:51:17.090 --> 01:51:22.939
Anthony Taylor: you're good. Alright. So show me 55. Put it on camera. Where are you at? With what? We just covered

1173
01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:27.300
Anthony Taylor: twos, threes, twos, fours, hey? No ones.

1174
01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:37.259
Anthony Taylor: I'm feeling good about it. Okay. cool. Those are. You got threes and fours and fives. Are you like experienced with this? You used this before?

1175
01:51:37.380 --> 01:51:41.270
Anthony Taylor: No, okay, that's good. That's good. I'm I'm happy with that

1176
01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:46.309
Anthony Taylor: alright notice. Because I added this. Now it says I've got another clue.

1177
01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:53.140
Anthony Taylor: I can save. Blah. Don't do that. That's bad idea. Then sync my changes. And now that's up there, too.

1178
01:51:53.890 --> 01:52:03.220
Anthony Taylor: Now, do you have to see changes every time? Absolutely not. You can commit, make a change, commit, make a change, commit, make a change.

1179
01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:06.500
Anthony Taylor: test everything works.

1180
01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:07.850
Anthony Taylor: Then push.

1181
01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:11.320
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright your turn.

1182
01:52:11.470 --> 01:52:27.199
Anthony Taylor: I went. Everybody finally gonna let you guys work. and it's only 9 40. On the second 8 40. On the second day.  so you're gonna create a repository. It tells you exactly what it, what what they want you to do.

1183
01:52:29.090 --> 01:52:33.629
Anthony Taylor: It tells you to use the terminal officially as of right now.

1184
01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:36.750
Anthony Taylor: I don't care if you use terminal or you use Vs code.

1185
01:52:37.590 --> 01:52:42.040
Anthony Taylor: Okay, Vs code will be the tool you will use. probably for

1186
01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:47.099
Anthony Taylor: alright. But if you want to use terminal feel free if you don't, that's fine, too.

1187
01:52:47.540 --> 01:52:51.200
Anthony Taylor: If you use the terminal, you could do get status.

1188
01:52:51.290 --> 01:52:59.230
Anthony Taylor: If you're not using the terminal when you're at Vs code, all you pretty much have to do is click on this dude over here, and you'll see what what's going on.

1189
01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:02.050
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Yeah.

1190
01:53:04.380 --> 01:53:05.220
Anthony Taylor: that's it.

1191
01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:13.210
Anthony Taylor: So do all of this. It should only take you like 10 min, if that. and let's do it. So here's what's gonna happen.

1192
01:53:13.510 --> 01:53:24.440
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to make breakout rooms. You will be automatically put into the breakout room. In this particular case all of you have to do it. But one of you could share your screen if you want.

1193
01:53:24.780 --> 01:53:27.349
Anthony Taylor: Remember, everybody talks

1194
01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:31.460
Anthony Taylor: so, even if you already know how to do it. Don't

1195
01:53:31.500 --> 01:53:41.560
Anthony Taylor: talk the whole time like Anthony. All right, let somebody else talk and let them get involved. We need everybody involved. That's how we learn. Yes, Meredith.

1196
01:53:43.410 --> 01:53:52.120
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I just you. Just a second ago you showed the instructions on your screen is that

1197
01:53:52.210 --> 01:53:55.610
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I found the download file.

1198
01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:03.570
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So in gitlab or in download files, canvas. They should be there. If not.

1199
01:54:04.140 --> 01:54:06.129
Anthony Taylor: I will post this

1200
01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:09.579
Anthony Taylor: in in slack, just in case

sonja baro: yeah, if you down, it's in Class 2,

1204
01:54:18.510 --> 01:54:20.799
Meredith McCanse (she/her): okay, the like. The zip file.

1205
01:54:21.190 --> 01:54:23.930
Kevin Nguyen: Do we teach them how to pull anything.

1206
01:54:25.150 --> 01:54:30.400
Anthony Taylor: how to pull from? Get lab, not yet. But basically, yeah.

1207
01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:45.700
Anthony Taylor: we haven't done it. But we we just showed them out. So anyway, I just put it up in slack also. So you guys should be go. Okay. Alright. Thank you. Aye. welcome back, everybody. What do you guys think about breakout rooms? Aren't they fine?

1208
01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:47.990
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I love.

1209
01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:50.659
Meredith McCanse (she/her): We ran out of time

1210
01:54:51.410 --> 01:54:53.630
Anthony Taylor: that happens. Oh, oh.

1211
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:58.200
Anthony Taylor: I forgot to tell you that we will always run out of time, as it's

1212
01:54:58.750 --> 01:55:02.020
Anthony Taylor: alright. Every once in a while you will finish everything.

1213
01:55:02.150 --> 01:55:06.910
Anthony Taylor:  it it. It's not very often.

1214
01:55:07.220 --> 01:55:17.720
Anthony Taylor: so usually what I want you to do when that happens we will, of course, review it so you can either do it while we're reviewing it, or you can do it. Like, you know.

1215
01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:18.810
Anthony Taylor: after class.

1216
01:55:18.970 --> 01:55:23.330
Anthony Taylor: Okay? It happens a lot that run out of time. And I need it.

1217
01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:27.130
Anthony Taylor: There's just no, there's no way around. It just happens.

1218
01:55:27.450 --> 01:55:30.929
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so let's quickly go through that.

1219
01:55:32.250 --> 01:55:42.020
Anthony Taylor:  that's interesting. So there wasn't a whole lot to say to that.

1220
01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:51.130
Tania Raugewitz: if if I can, I don't know what I was sharing my screen. And now my camera will come on. So I'm here. How is that possible?

1221
01:55:52.210 --> 01:56:06.660
Tania Raugewitz:  And I'm thinking that no, that was happening before my start. Video is slashed.

1222
01:56:07.260 --> 01:56:11.340
Tania Raugewitz: So it's not along the little arrow next to it.

1223
01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:15.530
Tania Raugewitz: Yeah, I know. Do you have like more than one camera listed?

1224
01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:16.820
Tania Raugewitz: No

1225
01:56:17.670 --> 01:56:19.120
Anthony Taylor: file. Poo

1226
01:56:19.850 --> 01:56:22.449
Masarirambi, Rodney: may also be a permissions issue, because I

1227
01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:30.999
Masarirambi, Rodney: figured out that buying issue with sharing was that I needed to restart zoom in order to enable sharing and all that stuff so it could be permissions as well.

1228
01:56:31.150 --> 01:56:39.149
Anthony Taylor: Well, Tanya, I won't be mad at you today if your camera how's that? I don't get mad at anybody?

1229
01:56:39.390 --> 01:56:41.250
Anthony Taylor: Alright?

1230
01:56:42.450 --> 01:56:43.950
Anthony Taylor: okay

1231
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:51.380
Anthony Taylor: view. So how do you do what? Show me, Meredith? Let's let's be the show person.

1232
01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:57.210
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay, I think this is the right screen.

1233
01:56:57.940 --> 01:57:02.199
Meredith McCanse (she/her): We didn't quite finish, though we were at the process of trying to clone.

1234
01:57:02.860 --> 01:57:07.550
Anthony Taylor: That looks good. Oh, push! Yes.

1235
01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:13.960
Meredith McCanse (she/her): okay, if anybody gets this. And this is common just type. Yes.

1236
01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:17.890
Meredith McCanse (she/her): oh, I have to do the lower case. Yes, but

1237
01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:21.979
Anthony Taylor: alright, no, it's good. Okay. So that's done. So what did it tell you to do next

1238
01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:26.090
Meredith McCanse (she/her): receiving objects done?

1239
01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:29.069
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Oh, in the instructions are on git bash!

1240
01:57:29.540 --> 01:57:32.600
Anthony Taylor: No, in the instruction. I I'm gonna open the instruction, Steven.

1241
01:57:42.610 --> 01:57:48.940
Meredith McCanse (she/her): and with that thing like a one time thing. And now it'll work. Okay. Cool.

1242
01:57:49.070 --> 01:57:52.090
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

1243
01:57:52.830 --> 01:57:54.280
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Oh, sorry. Say it again.

1244
01:57:54.590 --> 01:57:55.930
Anthony Taylor: Go to Vs code.

1245
01:57:56.390 --> 01:58:04.090
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay? So I can do code space.

1246
01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:05.500
Anthony Taylor: You should.

1247
01:58:06.650 --> 01:58:13.120
Anthony Taylor: Yup, it's on a different screen. Let me pull it over. Bring on over

1248
01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:14.370
Meredith McCanse (she/her): you see it?

1249
01:58:14.740 --> 01:58:17.640
Anthony Taylor: Yes, I can. Oh.

1250
01:58:17.690 --> 01:58:20.310
Anthony Taylor: oh. okay, close that.

1251
01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:34.130
Anthony Taylor: You're actually one folder to high, so close that completely and then now do CD and go into and just do CD space and type first.

1252
01:58:34.390 --> 01:58:36.820
Anthony Taylor: and then hit tab. Nope.

1253
01:58:36.990 --> 01:58:38.299
Tania Raugewitz: lower case first.

1254
01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:40.569
Anthony Taylor: There you go. Tap.

1255
01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:50.259
Anthony Taylor: There you go. Enter. Oh, is that just so? It it automatically will fill it in with. So it goes into the correct folder. Now do code space dot

1256
01:58:52.290 --> 01:59:01.800
Anthony Taylor: everybody with this so far.

1257
01:59:02.090 --> 01:59:06.520
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Do you notice also it tells you what branch you're in now to see that little blue main there?

1258
01:59:06.950 --> 01:59:12.780
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So bring that Vs code over. And it said, edit something in the readme. So

1259
01:59:13.570 --> 01:59:19.749
Anthony Taylor: okay, so here's the read me, just type something inside of there.

1260
01:59:21.530 --> 01:59:25.900
Meredith McCanse (she/her):  how come it already? Says something in here?

1261
01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:27.100
Anthony Taylor: I don't know.

1262
01:59:27.250 --> 01:59:32.089
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Oh, because when we set it up, okay.

1263
01:59:32.150 --> 01:59:43.199
Meredith McCanse (she/her): yes, it did

1264
01:59:43.420 --> 01:59:45.289
Meredith McCanse (she/her): K. Control. S.

1265
01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:48.560
Anthony Taylor: Now, if you want.

1266
01:59:48.950 --> 01:59:53.219
Anthony Taylor: you can go back to your prompt again, or do you want to do it in here, I'll leave it up to you.

1267
01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:58.490
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Alright. Can I go here for a second, at least. Type it status

1268
01:59:58.900 --> 02:00:05.349
Meredith McCanse (she/her): status. Get status. Get status. Okay? Now you can see your reading is changed.

1269
02:00:05.460 --> 02:00:09.260
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So do get space, add space period.

1270
02:00:12.130 --> 02:00:12.970
Anthony Taylor: Enter.

1271
02:00:13.130 --> 02:00:16.280
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Thank you for waiting. And now, do you get status?

1272
02:00:17.370 --> 02:00:18.890
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So the git add.

1273
02:00:19.090 --> 02:00:23.879
Meredith McCanse (she/her): so basically, what this does is. Now we're tracking this file.

1274
02:00:24.490 --> 02:00:29.559
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So now and actually, notice, if you notice the Vs code behind you.

1275
02:00:29.620 --> 02:00:31.150
Anthony Taylor: it's changed. Colors

1276
02:00:31.750 --> 02:00:42.549
Anthony Taylor: no longer, says you, which is untracked. By the way, now it says like modified or monitor. So now get status again. You'll see what it says.

1277
02:00:42.900 --> 02:00:45.650
Anthony Taylor: It's green committed.

1278
02:00:47.160 --> 02:00:52.299

1286
02:01:30.940 --> 02:01:35.510
Meredith McCanse (she/her): right now you can push. Do a git push.

1287

Anthony Taylor: Show me real quick.

1349
02:06:20.660 --> 02:06:22.070
Mckimmy, Brandon: Let me. Just.

1350
02:06:22.090 --> 02:06:28.880
Anthony Taylor: We don't do this. We're not gonna do this every time, like really well, but this is like the first breakout, or really what you guys all get.

1351
02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:31.730
Anthony Taylor: But I want y'all to listen to me.

1352
02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:39.239
Anthony Taylor: Okay, please. This is the opportunity for you to help your fellow students and to work.

1353
02:06:39.410 --> 02:06:45.830
Anthony Taylor: Don't just go. Mine's working. I'm gonna check out while there. We're helping that student no to help me solve the problem.

1354
02:06:46.160 --> 02:06:48.879
Anthony Taylor: Even if you don't talk about help, you solve the problem

1355
02:06:49.050 --> 02:06:57.649
Anthony Taylor: because being able to solve these problems is going to what is going to be what makes you different than other people applying for the same job.

1356
02:06:58.530 --> 02:07:00.549
Anthony Taylor: Alright, alright! So let me see where you're at.

Anthony Taylor: code space period is gonna open. Vs code. Enter. Look at that now. Say, Kuwait, don't do anything. Check that checkbox and then say, yes, I trust myself.

1361
02:07:36.810 --> 02:07:38.280

Anthony Taylor: We'll do yours this way. Okay, so just type anything in there real quick. We'll do yours through Vs code.

1364
02:07:52.260 --> 02:07:53.600
Anthony Taylor: Just type something.

1365
02:07:55.480 --> 02:07:57.839

Anthony Taylor: And now sync changes.

1371
02:08:29.220 --> 02:08:32.920
Anthony Taylor: Boom, okay, don't show again, or okay, whatever you feel like.

1372
02:08:36.740 --> 02:08:38.539
Anthony Taylor: make sure it goes

1373
02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:45.839
Anthony Taylor: once you. So you need your token. Then, too, no.

Anthony Taylor: Brandon needs token. Go ahead and sign in, for now

1375

Mckimmy, Brandon: Is that gonna be given the name the token?

1377
02:08:55.920 --> 02:09:02.820
Anthony Taylor: No, it's something that you have to do. But it was in your pre-word. Don't worry about it. Just say authorize, get ecosystem

1378
02:09:04.090 --> 02:09:08.030
Anthony Taylor:  and that should be all you need.

1379
02:09:09.450 --> 02:09:11.310
Anthony Taylor: Go back to the Vs code.

1380
02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:23.050
Anthony Taylor: and alright, let me get you a token. Token will make this automatic. So you don't have to wait for it like that.

1381
02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:27.879
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but you're good, you you did it. You're in good shape, Rodney. What's up?

1382
02:09:29.630 --> 02:09:31.610
Masarirambi, Rodney: So that

1383
02:09:31.920 --> 02:09:42.730
Masarirambi, Rodney: it fixed. My, she's got it. The first commit done. I didn't get a on Vs code saying, Do I want to periodically run, fetch

1384
02:09:43.490 --> 02:09:50.880
Anthony Taylor: every now and then, and then it went away. So I wasn't sure what? Okay? Cool to do it. So you're okay.

1385
02:09:51.060 --> 02:09:55.679
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. I mean, there's nothing wrong with this, but it can mess you up.

1386
02:09:56.160 --> 02:10:02.410
Anthony Taylor: So so I would stay away from that, but it's not gonna hurt anything if you push. Yes.

1387
02:10:03.580 --> 02:10:08.050
Anthony Taylor: cool. One more thing. Oh, sorry. Good deal.

1388
02:10:08.510 --> 02:10:10.679
Anthony Taylor: I one more thing to cover on git

1389
02:10:11.620 --> 02:10:13.649
Tania Raugewitz: before we call it a day.

1390
02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:15.220
Anthony Taylor: And that

1391
02:10:15.310 --> 02:10:16.430
branching.

1392
02:10:17.900 --> 02:10:22.970
Anthony Taylor:  so here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna go back to.

1393
02:10:23.370 --> 02:10:28.049
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna do all of this vs, code. Okay, we're not gonna do any more terminal term.

1394
02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:32.449
Tania Raugewitz: Sorry. I say that out loud, but attacks

1395
02:10:32.700 --> 02:10:35.220
Anthony Taylor: okay, it stinks. Is that better?

1396
02:10:35.330 --> 02:10:41.779
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So we're gonna create a branch. Actually, I'm gonna update. I think I have update you. Hold on 1 s.

1397
02:10:42.270 --> 02:10:47.920
Anthony Taylor: I do not. If I ever see your thing like this, I would be like, go install that update and then reach out.

1398
02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:52.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay, Vs code. Particular.

1399
02:10:52.100 --> 02:10:54.800
Anthony Taylor: If you don't install updates that will just stop working.

1400
02:10:55.760 --> 02:10:57.539
Anthony Taylor: So always install the update.

1401
02:10:58.230 --> 02:11:00.490
Anthony Taylor:  now.

1402
02:11:02.500 --> 02:11:04.440
Anthony Taylor: and yes, it'll close your Bs code.

1403
02:11:07.900 --> 02:11:08.609
Thank you.

1404
02:11:09.660 --> 02:11:11.559
Anthony Taylor: I don't know why it's still doing that. Okay.

1405
02:11:11.950 --> 02:11:15.930
Anthony Taylor:  So I'm gonna go back to

1406
02:11:17.660 --> 02:11:19.020
Tania Raugewitz: my folder.

1407
02:11:19.540 --> 02:11:22.410
Anthony Taylor: There it comes. Who's waiting for me to close that one?

1408
02:11:23.530 --> 02:11:25.190
Anthony Taylor: Now it thinks

1409
02:11:26.790 --> 02:11:27.550
1 s.

1410
02:11:28.630 --> 02:11:29.540
Anthony Taylor: there is

1411
02:11:29.670 --> 02:11:35.579
Anthony Taylor: okay. So we're back to here. Okay, so what I'm gonna do is

1412
02:11:35.780 --> 02:11:38.190
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna go over here to my get

1413
02:11:39.230 --> 02:11:42.599
Anthony Taylor: in fact, no, let's do it this way from right here.

1414
02:11:42.930 --> 02:11:47.510
Anthony Taylor: We're going to create a branch. How do we do that? So go up to view.

1415
02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:58.900
Anthony Taylor: Go to command pilot and type. GIT. And that did work so type branch. There we go.

1416
02:11:58.930 --> 02:12:02.340
Anthony Taylor: So now we get git, create branch.

1417
02:12:03.570 --> 02:12:07.879
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now remember the picture. We had the main tree. That's all these 5.

1418
02:12:07.990 --> 02:12:13.000
Anthony Taylor: And we had a branch. So what we're gonna do, I'm gonna create a branch so that Kevin

1419
02:12:13.180 --> 02:12:22.480
Anthony Taylor: can work on some of his stuff in my repository. So I'm gonna create branch. It's gonna say, please provide the new branch name heaven.

1420
02:12:23.740 --> 02:12:25.430
Anthony Taylor: Kevin's branch

1421
02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:29.840
Anthony Taylor: alright enter. and that's it.

1422
02:12:30.970 --> 02:12:32.609
Anthony Taylor: I've created Branch.

1423
02:12:32.650 --> 02:12:34.819
Tania Raugewitz: How do I know I created a branch.

1424
02:12:39.740 --> 02:12:40.769
Look at that!

1425
02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:45.089
Anthony Taylor: And now, says Kevin Sprint, y'all say that, too.

1426
02:12:45.370 --> 02:12:49.239
Anthony Taylor: whatever you called yours, I don't know if you all call the Kevin's branch. That might be good. But

1427
02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:50.410
Anthony Taylor: I did.

1428
02:12:51.630 --> 02:12:53.499
Anthony Taylor: We got it. Is that working?

1429
02:12:55.270 --> 02:12:56.240
Tania Raugewitz: Yeah.

1430
02:12:56.360 --> 02:12:57.590
Mason, Natalie: alright?

1431
02:12:58.330 --> 02:13:02.630
Anthony Taylor: No. What's wrong, Natalie? Did you? Did you do the create branch in the top.

1432
02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:08.570
Mason, Natalie:  yeah, my mine doesn't even pull up that option.

1433
02:13:09.230 --> 02:13:12.759
Anthony Taylor: You might. Did you ever get logged into your github because you didn't have a token

1434
02:13:12.850 --> 02:13:16.160
Mason, Natalie: I did.

1435
02:13:18.420 --> 02:13:23.070
Mason, Natalie: Okay.

1436
02:13:23.090 --> 02:13:27.919
Anthony Taylor: because I will. We'll get you. We'll get you through it alright. Another way to create a branch.

1437
02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:33.180
Anthony Taylor: You could come down here and you could change your branches down here, too, so I can go back to Main Branch.

1438
02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:37.220
Anthony Taylor: or I could go to Kevin Sprint.

1439
02:13:37.580 --> 02:13:44.250
Anthony Taylor: or I could go to main and then create a new branch from here. Okay.

1440
02:13:44.420 --> 02:13:49.909
Anthony Taylor: there's all kinds of ways to create a branch really cool. So what is a branch? Well, let's go to Kevin's Branch.

1441
02:13:50.920 --> 02:13:54.020
Anthony Taylor: and in Kevin's Branch I'm gonna create a new file.

1442
02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:55.850
Anthony Taylor: Paul Kevin's

1443
02:13:56.420 --> 02:14:01.380
Anthony Taylor: file dot text. Now, this is the code that Kevin's going to work on.

1444
02:14:08.490 --> 02:14:12.879
Tania Raugewitz: Alright. So he saves this. Everything pretty much is exactly the same.

1445
02:14:13.340 --> 02:14:19.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay? He's got we've got. Do we want to commit? Yeah, file

1446
02:14:19.660 --> 02:14:20.800
Anthony Taylor: commit?

1447
02:14:20.910 --> 02:14:28.699
Anthony Taylor: Do we want to publish now? It says, Publish branch instead of push. That's because right now we haven't pushed this branch up to give up.

1448
02:14:29.250 --> 02:14:35.600
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So if we go look under branches. Which is this little thing right here? Okay.

1449
02:14:36.510 --> 02:14:40.440
Anthony Taylor: there's no new branch. So let's go ahead and publish this branch.

1450
02:14:40.960 --> 02:14:44.860
Anthony Taylor: So what it's gonna do is copy all that up

1451
02:14:46.220 --> 02:14:52.530
Anthony Taylor: refresh this. We'll see. We now have another option.

1452
02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.530
Anthony Taylor: So, looking at our files.

1453
02:14:57.670 --> 02:15:00.980
Anthony Taylor: no, Kevin's branch. everybody see that.

1454
02:15:01.990 --> 02:15:02.850
Anthony Taylor: But

1455
02:15:03.290 --> 02:15:06.120
Anthony Taylor: if I change it to Kevin's branch

1456
02:15:07.470 --> 02:15:09.139
Anthony Taylor: I can see Kevin's hut.

1457
02:15:10.780 --> 02:15:14.769
Anthony Taylor: Okay, everything Kevin does in this branch

1458
02:15:14.810 --> 02:15:18.420
Anthony Taylor: is isolated from Maine.

1459
02:15:19.660 --> 02:15:23.670
Anthony Taylor: He can't touch me right now. Okay.

1460
02:15:24.270 --> 02:15:30.519
Anthony Taylor:  one thing we're gonna ask you guys to do. If you see this, protect this branch, go ahead and do that.

1461
02:15:31.010 --> 02:15:32.000
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1462
02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:36.069
Tania Raugewitz: tell it. You want to protect me, require and just check that box.

1463
02:15:36.860 --> 02:15:44.940
Anthony Taylor: Aye, that's all. You and then create and log. Why do they make us do all that stuff.

1464
02:15:45.830 --> 02:15:51.059
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And that just creates a rule. Don't don't sweat it if you don't see it when you see it.

1465
02:15:51.150 --> 02:15:59.630
Anthony Taylor: Know that I want you to do that. Alright. So let's say, Kevin's been working on this for like a week. He has tested it.

1466
02:15:59.660 --> 02:16:02.640
Anthony Taylor: Everything is awesome. Now I want

1467
02:16:02.830 --> 02:16:13.189
Anthony Taylor: Kevin's file from his branch to be put into the main branch. So we're in Kevin's Branch. See? Right there. And I want it

1468
02:16:13.570 --> 02:16:15.540
Anthony Taylor: in here are in

1469
02:16:16.470 --> 02:16:17.290
Anthony Taylor: Ming.

1470
02:16:18.080 --> 02:16:22.869
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's just so you guys know, we normally teach this like in the fourth week.

1471
02:16:23.780 --> 02:16:31.070
Anthony Taylor: Alright, this is like, not something we normally do on the second day. So don't worry. If you're not getting it, we're gonna go over it again when we get to projects.

1472
02:16:31.760 --> 02:16:39.790
Anthony Taylor: So I Kevin made his changes to come in here and he's gonna do compare and pull requests.

1473
02:16:40.309 --> 02:16:50.399
Anthony Taylor: See this button. and he's going to press that button. And he might say what it is that he changed, or what he did. and then he's gonna create it.

1474
02:16:50.600 --> 02:16:55.029
Anthony Taylor: Now as the owner of the depository, I heard him.

1475
02:16:55.230 --> 02:16:57.400
Anthony Taylor: the good master.

1476
02:16:57.680 --> 02:17:02.030
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's my job. I'm the good master. So

1477
02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:07.710
Anthony Taylor: I can come in here and look. do I need to change anything

1478
02:17:10.879 --> 02:17:18.689
Anthony Taylor: automatically was approving. I had to approve it first, but that's because I just protected it. So I'm just gonna say whatever and check that box.

1479
02:17:18.730 --> 02:17:20.189
Anthony Taylor: Now I can do.

1480
02:17:21.270 --> 02:17:22.160
Anthony Taylor: I can

1481
02:17:23.590 --> 02:17:29.740
Anthony Taylor: per merge the pull request because there's no errors. Nothing's stopping. Confirm the merge

1482
02:17:30.820 --> 02:17:36.320
Anthony Taylor: pull requests successfully merged and closed. Now I can delete Kevin's branch

1483
02:17:36.980 --> 02:17:39.879
Anthony Taylor: because I've merged it. We don't need it. Anymore.

1484
02:17:40.540 --> 02:17:44.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And you can see there's a little history here. So when we go back

1485
02:17:45.889 --> 02:17:51.779
Anthony Taylor: and we look, Heaven's branch is gone. Maine is the only branch. And Lookie, there.

1486
02:17:51.809 --> 02:17:53.240
Anthony Taylor: there's Kevin's file.

1487
02:17:54.680 --> 02:17:56.860
Anthony Taylor: So did everybody follow that? I mean

1488
02:17:57.120 --> 02:17:58.170
Anthony Taylor: again.

1489
02:17:58.350 --> 02:18:03.410
Anthony Taylor: don't worry. If you didn't mail it today, you're gonna get to see this again before. You need to know it.

1490
02:18:03.820 --> 02:18:05.179
Anthony Taylor: Rodney, you're up.

1491
02:18:06.940 --> 02:18:16.549
Masarirambi, Rodney: Oh, I followed it. But my question is, why did we delete Kevin's branch? Because later on

1492
02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:20.349
Anthony Taylor: you could you could, but you'd have to re-pool anyway.

1493
02:18:21.110 --> 02:18:30.209
Anthony Taylor: Right? So if he makes for now let let me tell you this, there was the option to not delete his branch. It's totally depends on your use case on what you're doing.

1494
02:18:30.600 --> 02:18:35.379
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you could leave it and let him continue working on it and merge it again later.

1495
02:18:35.610 --> 02:18:39.539
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's okay. There's nothing wrong with that. But most of the time

1496
02:18:40.059 --> 02:18:51.569
Anthony Taylor: again, depending on your workflow, like for me, for the people that work for work. No one technically works for the people that work with me. Okay, I tell them

1497
02:18:51.690 --> 02:18:56.349
Anthony Taylor: when you're ready to push you tell me I'll push it. You're done.

1498
02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:00.520
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you can keep your code. You can do what you want with it. But

1499
02:19:00.910 --> 02:19:07.170
Anthony Taylor: there is no branch. Okay, we're gonna get rid of that branch cause you've you finished your your part of the job.

1500
02:19:07.629 --> 02:19:13.680
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Something wrong with it, and you know, have to. It's just like a preference. If you know.

1501
02:19:14.209 --> 02:19:28.500
Masarirambi, Rodney: So I think I understand where where it's lost. I think I was thinking that that the code is then also going to be deleted from the device and stuff like that. But now notice Kevin's branch

1502
02:19:28.650 --> 02:19:31.869
Anthony Taylor: no longer. Technically, it says it exists, but it really doesn't.

1503
02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:36.290
Anthony Taylor: Okay. If I was to pull it, or when I do a pull here.

1504
02:19:36.410 --> 02:19:38.590
Anthony Taylor: it's going to disappear.

1505
02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:45.970
Anthony Taylor: See? Couldn't find Kevin's Branch alright, so I'll have to change back to Maine

1506
02:19:47.100 --> 02:19:48.610
Anthony Taylor: and then do a

1507
02:19:51.310 --> 02:19:55.370
Anthony Taylor: and then I'll be okay. But now I'll see Evans files in May.

1508
02:19:56.090 --> 02:19:58.449
Anthony Taylor: Meredith, what can I do for you?

1509
02:19:59.900 --> 02:20:01.629
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So in when you're

1510
02:20:01.820 --> 02:20:13.180
Meredith McCanse (she/her): when you merge it, do you? Is when you do, you run into potential issues if you like. Kevin had files in there with the same name as other files in the main. And that's where you're gonna run into version control issues.

1511
02:20:13.630 --> 02:20:19.989
Anthony Taylor: Yes. So what I will tell you. And again, this is a great example of why we don't normally teach this until project.

1512
02:20:20.260 --> 02:20:24.350
Anthony Taylor: Right? When your project comes around, you're all gonna have groups.

1513
02:20:24.490 --> 02:20:26.510
Anthony Taylor: okay, 3 to 4 people.

1514
02:20:27.600 --> 02:20:36.999
Anthony Taylor: You're going. One of you is going to be the gitmaster. You're going to create a github or positive. Then you're going to invite the members of your group.

1515
02:20:37.550 --> 02:20:47.969
Anthony Taylor: and they're all probably going to create a branch. You're going. You guys are going to decide what you're going to do. Decide who's going to do what? And they do their work in branch.

1516
02:20:49.150 --> 02:20:51.779
Anthony Taylor: What I will tell you to do.

1517
02:20:52.550 --> 02:20:53.860
Anthony Taylor: Everybody

1518
02:20:54.960 --> 02:20:58.110
Anthony Taylor: put your initials before your whatever file. You're working

1519
02:20:59.260 --> 02:21:01.460
Anthony Taylor: initial underscore, whatever you're working

1520
02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:11.869
Anthony Taylor: okay that way when you merge, unless some of you have some of the same initials which is possible. But when you merge it's very unlikely you're gonna crash into each other.

1521
02:21:12.040 --> 02:21:25.730
Anthony Taylor: and then when everybody's merged into a main, then go and see if you need to combine it. because if you're forced to do it in here. It's really other. And and I'll give you guys I mean, we won't do the activity. Because, like I said, we're gonna do this again later.

1522
02:21:25.970 --> 02:21:34.930
Anthony Taylor:  But I will show you how to do that or what it looks like. I don't. I hate urging.

1523
02:21:34.960 --> 02:21:35.970
Anthony Taylor: Hate it.

1524
02:21:35.980 --> 02:21:42.160
Anthony Taylor: We'll call this one Bob's branch. Bob's Bob, as you will find out, is my favorite name to use in ever.

1525
02:21:42.900 --> 02:21:52.050
Anthony Taylor: It's kind of funny in in. II wrote some of the curriculum on the data side data science side. And you could always tell which ones I wrote, because all the variables are bob and soup.

1526
02:21:52.900 --> 02:21:58.200
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we're in Bob's branch. I'm gonna change Kevin's file.

1527
02:22:00.300 --> 02:22:01.550
Anthony Taylor: Bob

1528
02:22:01.670 --> 02:22:05.130
Anthony Taylor: says, do this now.

1529
02:22:05.310 --> 02:22:07.050
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then I'm gonna save.

1530
02:22:07.770 --> 02:22:10.240
Anthony Taylor: So right now I'm fuck.

1531
02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:13.529
Anthony Taylor: I could push this everything would be fine.

1532
02:22:14.190 --> 02:22:16.979
Anthony Taylor: But let's go back to Maine for a second.

1533
02:22:20.760 --> 02:22:22.339
Anthony Taylor: Come on, go back to Maine.

1534
02:22:24.680 --> 02:22:26.719
Anthony Taylor: Oh, we'll close that, and then go back.

1535
02:22:26.910 --> 02:22:27.720
Anthony Taylor: There we go.

1536
02:22:27.880 --> 02:22:30.940
Anthony Taylor: And now open this up. What is going on here?

1537
02:22:32.150 --> 02:22:33.890
Anthony Taylor: And for AI,

1538
02:22:35.740 --> 02:22:40.109
Anthony Taylor: it should not be showing us that. Or let me close that.

1539
02:22:42.900 --> 02:22:44.700
Anthony Taylor: Let's go back to Bob's

1540
02:22:50.350 --> 02:22:51.570
Anthony Taylor: interesting.

1541
02:22:54.190 --> 02:22:57.940
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to save that. Then go to main

1542
02:22:58.910 --> 02:23:02.910
Anthony Taylor: type, something new. Well, we're open again in main.

1543
02:23:03.980 --> 02:23:06.949
Anthony Taylor: something new, save

1544
02:23:07.170 --> 02:23:09.020
Anthony Taylor: we're going to commit this one.

1545
02:23:10.050 --> 02:23:16.879
Anthony Taylor: 2 main commit and and see you can. Oh, I'd be put a message in

1546
02:23:17.970 --> 02:23:24.560
Anthony Taylor:  Bob's change is that's what happens if you don't put the message in here

1547
02:23:24.880 --> 02:23:34.799
Anthony Taylor: is, it'll give you that little box, and we're going to sync that. So that's been synced up to the main branch. So if we go in here we should. If that worked properly.

1548
02:23:34.820 --> 02:23:39.219
Anthony Taylor: we should see something new. Okay, but in

1549
02:23:39.800 --> 02:23:44.909
Anthony Taylor: Bob's branch oh, I haven't even pushed Bob's branch yet. Oh, maybe that's what was going on.

1550
02:23:45.470 --> 02:23:51.760
Anthony Taylor: So in Bob's branch it doesn't say something new. Okay, but watch this.

1551
02:23:52.250 --> 02:23:53.910
Anthony Taylor: Something. Old

1552
02:23:56.090 --> 02:23:58.509
Anthony Taylor: David published branch.

1553
02:23:59.860 --> 02:24:00.820
Anthony Taylor: commit

1554
02:24:03.960 --> 02:24:06.470
Anthony Taylor: Bob's stuff.

1555
02:24:10.130 --> 02:24:11.540
Anthony Taylor: Think changes.

1556
02:24:13.550 --> 02:24:15.960
Anthony Taylor: Oh, my God! Did it fix it on its own?

1557
02:24:17.160 --> 02:24:19.230
Anthony Taylor: Oh, okay. So now

1558
02:24:19.310 --> 02:24:24.889
Anthony Taylor: let's go look at the 2 branches up here. It did not fix it on itself. So we're gonna go back in here

1559
02:24:26.140 --> 02:24:29.780
Anthony Taylor: and we're going to look at. We're in Maine, Kevin's file

1560
02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:31.160
Anthony Taylor: something new.

1561
02:24:31.240 --> 02:24:34.350
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now let's go to Bob's branch.

1562
02:24:34.980 --> 02:24:36.270
Anthony Taylor: Something old.

1563
02:24:37.350 --> 02:24:39.739
Anthony Taylor: So we've done a push.

1564
02:24:40.690 --> 02:24:42.150
Anthony Taylor: We've done a commit.

1565
02:24:42.770 --> 02:24:54.310
Anthony Taylor: So that means we can do a push request, a pull request. So here we are. We're going to do a compare and pull request. So what does that mean? That means we're going to try to merge 5

1566
02:24:54.370 --> 02:24:55.760
Anthony Taylor: into May.

1567
02:24:56.830 --> 02:25:00.310
Anthony Taylor: Okay. create pull requests.

1568
02:25:01.470 --> 02:25:03.440
Anthony Taylor: Review required. Aha!

1569
02:25:04.640 --> 02:25:10.549
Anthony Taylor: That's what I was trying to show. This branch has conflicts that must be resolved.

1570
02:25:11.420 --> 02:25:16.410
Anthony Taylor: This is a merge conflict. This is what happens if you alter a file

1571
02:25:16.630 --> 02:25:25.669
Anthony Taylor: in 2 different places, and then try to bring them together. and then you have to resolve it. and by resolving them, that means you have to delete one of these

1572
02:25:27.530 --> 02:25:29.760
Anthony Taylor: and say, Yep, that's good to go.

1573
02:25:31.450 --> 02:25:32.320
Anthony Taylor: Got it?

1574
02:25:32.810 --> 02:25:34.320
Anthony Taylor: I know a lot of stuff.

1575
02:25:35.030 --> 02:25:35.930
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

1576
02:25:36.190 --> 02:25:38.600
Anthony Taylor:  we're gonna stop there

1577
02:25:39.110 --> 02:25:43.689
Anthony Taylor: perfect timing 2 min, which is pretty good, considering how far behind.

1578
02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:51.889
Anthony Taylor:  I'm not, you know, just between you guys and me and somebody's gonna tell me about it because they're watching these videos. I'm not supposed to say on the.

1579
02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:57.470
Anthony Taylor: But but that's okay. Because we did cover bridge. Okay?

1580
02:25:57.610 --> 02:26:00.369
Anthony Taylor: And that was the end.

1581
02:26:01.290 --> 02:26:07.770
Anthony Taylor: So all we missed was that activity? What I recommend for you guys feel free to go try the activity yourself.

1582
02:26:07.990 --> 02:26:12.240
Anthony Taylor: Come back to class tomorrow, and if you have questions I'm happy to help you dead.

1583
02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:14.290
Anthony Taylor: But remember.

1584
02:26:14.330 --> 02:26:18.440
Anthony Taylor: we will cover this again at Project one.

1585
02:26:18.670 --> 02:26:24.580
Anthony Taylor: because that's the next time you're gonna need like creating, or, you know, creating every what you do for your challenges.

1586
02:26:24.610 --> 02:26:29.980
Anthony Taylor: But the merging and all that stuff branches. You don't do any of that until project one.

1587
02:26:31.220 --> 02:26:36.200
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but you needed to know how to create a repo and do commit push.

1588
02:26:36.980 --> 02:26:38.770
Anthony Taylor: because that's for your challenges.

1589
02:26:38.940 --> 02:26:45.049
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Every challenge starts with something like, Create a repo called AI challenge.

1590
02:26:45.810 --> 02:26:53.100
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And that's what you'll do. And then that's what you'll submit for with your homework. Hi! Any questions

1591
02:26:53.740 --> 02:26:58.179
Anthony Taylor: I know. Probably all like threes right now, except for a couple of yeah.

1592
02:26:58.950 --> 02:27:00.550
Anthony Taylor: Don't tell me your tubes.

1593
02:27:00.990 --> 02:27:02.830
Anthony Taylor: Pretty sure you might be Chips.

1594
02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:04.960
Anthony Taylor: Yes, Meredith.

1595
02:27:05.050 --> 02:27:13.119
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Anthony, where can we access? The slide decks are those in queue?

1596
02:27:13.810 --> 02:27:17.200
Anthony Taylor: There'll be like a Pdf file and get that.

1597
02:27:18.260 --> 02:27:19.970
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay, thank you.

1598
02:27:20.260 --> 02:27:21.450
Anthony Taylor: You're very welcome.

1599
02:27:21.710 --> 02:27:24.719
Anthony Taylor: The reason we do that we call gitlab, like your textbook.

1600
02:27:25.040 --> 02:27:29.889
Anthony Taylor: Alright, when you're done. The only thing you'll really still have access. You have slack for a while

1601
02:27:29.930 --> 02:27:32.000
Anthony Taylor: that you will

1602
02:27:32.170 --> 02:27:37.360
Anthony Taylor: your gitlab. You can download the whole thing. So all the activities, all the slideshows.

1603
02:27:38.190 --> 02:27:43.440
Anthony Taylor: The hardest thing is is you don't get my videos, which I know is terrible. But anyway.

1604
02:27:43.550 --> 02:27:47.809
Anthony Taylor: so recap we seem. You know, we've done a lot today. Guys

1605
02:27:48.050 --> 02:27:58.460
Anthony Taylor: supervised and unsupervised models, neural networks and deep learning and methods, processing and transformers all in one day. That's madness.

1606
02:27:59.110 --> 02:28:05.090
Anthony Taylor: We learned how to deal with. Get Hub. It's funny, it says, using the get gooey. We never talked about.

1607
02:28:05.410 --> 02:28:07.769
Anthony Taylor: It's not even in the instruction. So

1608
02:28:08.250 --> 02:28:08.980
Anthony Taylor: what a!

1609
02:28:09.130 --> 02:28:15.080
Anthony Taylor: And then we did active push with the command line, and then, for some reason, we also did branching.

1610
02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:19.059
Anthony Taylor:  do not worry about branching

1611
02:28:19.660 --> 02:28:23.580
Anthony Taylor: at all until project one. Okay.

1612
02:28:25.230 --> 02:28:27.020
Anthony Taylor: get clone.

1613
02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:28.870
Anthony Taylor: It status.

1614
02:28:29.350 --> 02:28:33.729
Anthony Taylor: Add git commit hit. Push all you have to remember from today.

1615
02:28:35.110 --> 02:28:40.430
Anthony Taylor: Alright, Hi, gang! It's all I have for you. Fantastic work

Anthony Taylor: next. Next class.

1617
02:28:42.710 --> 02:28:54.570
Anthony Taylor:  we're gonna talk about some more cool AI stuff. We're gonna get more into the the like, we're going to get ready to start code. Basically. okay, next week

1618
02:28:54.910 --> 02:29:03.220
Anthony Taylor: is going to be your hands in python. You're going to become programs starting next week. Right now, you're just kind of learning what's coming.

1619
02:29:03.940 --> 02:29:13.139
Anthony Taylor: Okay, Hi, gang have a great night. See you? Tomorrow we will be here for 30 min. Anybody wants to stick around or talk to Tas. Feel free to hang out.
