00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:47.119
Anthony Taylor:  Today's a good day. I really, I really, honestly.

2
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.129
Anthony Taylor: I've been looking forward today. I look forward to a lot of the sections that we're gonna do.

3
00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:02.159
Anthony Taylor: But again, today is I mean, I said, last class, many of you came here because of things like chat

4
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.689
Anthony Taylor: and some of the Llm excitement, you know, especially when you guys first started.

5
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.790
Anthony Taylor: That was like all the rage

6
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.030
Anthony Taylor: and it kind of still is. In fact, I'd say it might even be more now.

7
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:28.500
Anthony Taylor:  This is how that all started. and how we are going to morph ourselves into a better understanding of how these things work.

8
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.480
Anthony Taylor: and and then what we can do with them. and

9
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.380
Anthony Taylor: all of that, because right now I would assume it's mostly a mystery to most of you

10
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.370
Anthony Taylor: right. How long have we been able to do these cool things?

11
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.969
Anthony Taylor: How long you think ll limbs have been around.

12
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.169
Anthony Taylor: you might be surprised to know it's been a long.

13
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.030
Anthony Taylor: that's what she was.

14
00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:04.990
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Well, 50. I don't know. The exact timeline became common, but fiftys was when the perceptron was created.

15
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:16.490
Anthony Taylor: So so I mean, you need the neural networks and things like that. The the Lms. Themselves, the capability to do what they do really

16
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.630
Anthony Taylor: didn't come to

17
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.960
Anthony Taylor: a major turning point until a couple of like 4 years ago.

18
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.159
Anthony Taylor: I'd have to look up the exact date until a fellow post created an article about attention.

19
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:38.949
Anthony Taylor: And what attention allowed it to do is understand context better. What we're gonna do today, I'm gonna show you we have.

20
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:55.710
Anthony Taylor: We're what you're going to see is us how we initially started n, lp. and how we still use it for a lot of things this way. But you're going to understand as we get through it, how it really doesn't do well with context.

21
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.440
Anthony Taylor: But it does great

22
00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.630
Anthony Taylor: with individual words. Okay, so

23
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.140
Anthony Taylor: let's go.

24
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:19.830
Anthony Taylor: We're going to define Nlp and implement its workflow today. That's the goal. Today, though, we're only going to get through the preprocessing steps. We're gonna demonstrate how to tokenize text.

25
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:27.980
Anthony Taylor: We're going to proficiently preprocessed text, including tokenization and punctuation, handling for analysis.

26
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:43.419
Anthony Taylor: manage and process, punctuation marks and other non alpha alphabetic characters. So there we just simply restated this differentiate between stemming and lemmatization.

27
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.120
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

28
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:55.339
Anthony Taylor: understand the importance of removing stop words. These are out of order. It's kind of funny. I understand the demonstrate on how to count

29
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.930
Anthony Taylor: tokens and Ingrams. So there's a few words there. You probably are going. Yeah.

30
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.730
Anthony Taylor: yeah, don't worry about it. They'll understand them before today is over

31
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.430
Anthony Taylor: welcome.

32
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.870
Anthony Taylor: So natural language processing. What is it? What the heck are we talking about

33
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.600
Anthony Taylor: when we talk about natural language processing?

34
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.129
Anthony Taylor:  and this is it

35
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.340
Anthony Taylor: are everything. Think about everything we've done so far, especially in the Ml. Space. What

36
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.920
Anthony Taylor: is one of the most important steps for, like 99% of our models.

37
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.229
Anthony Taylor: and when we have words

38
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.499
Clayton Graves: like, ask that again

39
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:51.909
Anthony Taylor: encoding words in your encoding Meredith got it. If you have words, you have to encode them. Why do we have to encode them? They have to be numerate.

40
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.939
Anthony Taylor: have to be numbers.

41
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.960
Anthony Taylor: okay, computers

42
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:03.890
Anthony Taylor: and all they're making. This have no concept heck of even the alpha.

43
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.609
Clayton Graves: Are there in the English language? Are you assigning a numeric value to each one

44
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:25.430
Anthony Taylor: here, or or in those other ones in the code. No, no. In in machine learning. When we encode it's using some algorithm to encode the letters. Sometimes

45
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.699
Anthony Taylor: it can be, I mean, some encoding can be letter for letter.

46
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:35.660
Anthony Taylor: I can tell you. That's not how we're going to do it in the end. But that is one of the methods of code.

47
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.110
Anthony Taylor:  okay. So

48
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.049
Anthony Taylor: we encode these. And we do all this and and and computers just don't get it.

49
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.079
Anthony Taylor: They don't understand. When you put, you know

50
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.109
Anthony Taylor: SONJ. A.

51
00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:03.459
Anthony Taylor: You're spelling a word. They see numbers, they don't care. Oh, those numbers represent that picture. Okay, that they can understand.

52
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.850
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but they don't understand that that's a name they don't understand. If that's a label they don't, they don't understand

53
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.110
Anthony Taylor: alright and our. And and while we're going to do within lp

54
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:20.140
Anthony Taylor: is is technically just gonna have it learn patterns.

55
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.090
Anthony Taylor: But those patterns are going to be actual words.

56
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:32.190
Anthony Taylor: Even when we get into the heavier, deeper stuff. Technically, it's still just identifying patterns. It just gets much more complex.

57
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:33.160
Anthony Taylor: But

58
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:41.360
Anthony Taylor: so what is it used for? Well, you guys tell me, what are some things that lps used for that you use every day.

59
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.079
Clayton Graves: Jack, GPT.

60
00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.149
Anthony Taylor: Well, if you're using words. Yes, if you're speaking to it.

61
00:06:51.490 --> 00:07:02.450
Baro, Sonja: auto correct. Any of those auto correct? Is an lp, yeah. Alexa or Alexa and Echo, and all of them

62
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.640
Anthony Taylor: sash quiet, cancel.

63
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:11.099
Anthony Taylor: Correct those, for sure. All of your assistants that you have around your house on your phone.

64
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:17.410
Anthony Taylor: All of that is in lp. okay, it's listening to words.

65
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:24.330
Anthony Taylor: It's breaking those words apart, trying to come up with what the heck you're trying, what you're requesting.

66
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:29.670
Anthony Taylor: and then it's answering. So let's talk about. I've done a lot of coding on the Alexa devices.

67
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.249
Anthony Taylor: and I can tell you so

68
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.870
Anthony Taylor: it it. You say.

69
00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:40.250
Anthony Taylor: Alexa, what's the weather like in Denver, Colorado? Okay.

70
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:46.959
Anthony Taylor: What it hears once it triggers it hears Denver, Colorado weather.

71
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:51.679
Anthony Taylor: That's what it ends up taking out of that, and then it and that triggers

72
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:57.779
Anthony Taylor: a response. And that response is done through all kinds of craziness. But the response comes back, and that's about.

73
00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:05.890
Anthony Taylor: So that's in lp. again. does it understand what Denver Colorado weather means? Now.

74
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.419
Anthony Taylor: all we've done is given it a trigger

75
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:13.679
Anthony Taylor: that these 3 things, when put together, will trigger this response.

76
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay, all right.

77
00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.760
Anthony Taylor: Virtual assistant. This is a big one.

78
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.230
Anthony Taylor: you guys, I mean, how many of you do not have a virtual assistant?

79
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:26.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

80
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.519
Anthony Taylor: is that a choice? And I guess there is that a choice?

81
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.449
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I, Omini, very excited.

82
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.169
Derek Rikke: Never thought about it.

83
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:50.749
Anthony Taylor: Oh, okay, that's good, Meredith. I guess our phones have it. But, like yes, it is a choice. I do not have an Alexa or a Google home, or anything like that, and I don't want one.

84
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:55.939
Baro, Sonja: I don't use any siri, any of that stuff, even though Serie always pops up on me.

85
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:09.089
Baro, Sonja: which my phone just flashed right? So cause I haven't turned it off. But I need to. But no, II just. I'm not quite comfortable there, like even my TV, like the voice assistants and the Tvs and all that. I'm like.

86
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:10.430
Baro, Sonja: yeah.

87
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:17.860
Clayton Graves: I even have an echo in my bathroom. If you really want to listen into what goes on in there. That's on view.

88
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:30.059
Anthony Taylor: I think I'm close. I'm not quite that far, like I do have one in every room that works as an intercom system as well, and every pretty much every light in the house is controlled.

89
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:35.689
Baro, Sonja: You need to be able to say, bring me more toilet toilet paper.

90
00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.859
Baro, Sonja: There's a good use case.

91
00:09:53.050 --> 00:10:00.629
Anthony Taylor: There you go. Spam filters. Yeah. So when it's looking through your email.

92
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:14.830
Anthony Taylor: it's looking at the words that come in the email. And and it's not really looking at the context. It's looking at the words, looking at combinations of words. Misspelled words is a big indicator. For some reason.

93
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:19.849
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you would think that people doing spam would use a spell check.

94
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.219
Anthony Taylor: But they do not.

95
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:30.520
Anthony Taylor: So yeah, it's looking for specific types of words and stuff like that. Translators. This one's big right now

96
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:33.190
Anthony Taylor: cause the translators are getting fast

97
00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:40.389
Anthony Taylor: fast enough that when you see those claims it can translate in real time. You can start to believe it.

98
00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:47.020
Anthony Taylor: Anybody fell for those claims before it translates in real time, and then you buy and it's like.

99
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.009
Anthony Taylor: No, I'm never going to use.

100
00:10:50.730 --> 00:11:00.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Well, they're getting the point now where they can do it built especially like the newer phones, I mean, I was gonna say, pixel phones, but I didn't want to upset all my apple people.

101
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:08.579
Anthony Taylor: But the newer pixel phones with the built in AI chips and all that stuff. Those things, I mean are just stupid, quick with stuff like this.

102
00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.390
Anthony Taylor: Yes, Meredith.

103
00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:21.250
Meredith McCanse (she/her): what about function on Zoom? Is there any aspect of that that uses cause it often like it gives the first draft, and then it'll sort of correct itself.

104
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:25.229
Meredith McCanse (she/her): and it identifies when a sentence ends again. Yes.

105
00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:28.030
Anthony Taylor:  yes.

106
00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:38.139
Anthony Taylor: The the initial so closed captioning itself is not in. L, okay, that's just it. This, it's just audio to work.

107
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:49.399
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But like the corrections and stuff like that might be, I mean, it might be looking at like as it comes out and kind of like auto correct when you're typing a text message.

108
00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:54.539
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And and it corrects you there that that could be absolutely.

109
00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.300
Anthony Taylor: so absolutely

110
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:01.480
Anthony Taylor: okay.

111
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.519
Anthony Taylor: most industries have large quantities. So this is why

112
00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:17.370
Anthony Taylor: it's so important to do Nlp industries that have large quantities of text. And this goes for I don't even know if it really doesn't have a lot of text.

113
00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:23.559
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But I mean, law, obvious medical research again. Pretty obvious

114
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:29.030
Anthony Taylor: stock market analysis. Yeah, if you're like trying to read news reports.

115
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:35.689
Anthony Taylor: tweets. And you're trying to get some information from those words.

116
00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.559
Anthony Taylor: This is the place that this is the tool you're going to use. Now.

117
00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.869
Anthony Taylor: have we gotten tremendously better at this

118
00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:48.929
Anthony Taylor: with like Chat Tpr, the answer is a hundred percent, yes. But

119
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.900
Anthony Taylor: going to go through this method now.

120
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.630
Anthony Taylor: because this is kind of how we got into Jeff Bots and stuff like that.

121
00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:02.750
Anthony Taylor: Okay, these days you can pretty much go on a chat Tpt, or a beam chat, or

122
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:09.280
Anthony Taylor: any of like 20 of them. and just say, Tell me. or you can upload

123
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:15.039
Anthony Taylor: law. You can upload a legal document and say, explain this in English.

124
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:16.730
Anthony Taylor: done

125
00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:29.180
Clayton Graves: as an aside. I know we keep. When when I got the the biopsy results back. That's exactly what I did. Plugged it into jet gpg, and said, Dumb this down for me.

126
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.869
Clayton Graves: and it told me and said, you need to go see a doctor

127
00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:51.959
Anthony Taylor: that I got MRI last Friday, and I got the results, and I put mine in because I haven't heard of it. and and I and and again the same thing like I got well, I mean, it starts off with. I'm not a doctor I don't diagnose, but this is what this says

128
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:55.689
Anthony Taylor: right? And then I said, You know, dumb it down for a fifth grader.

129
00:13:55.710 --> 00:14:02.529
Anthony Taylor: And and it did, and it was perfect. And so it was. It was really cool. It was really cool.

130
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:07.610
Anthony Taylor: So law medical research stock market to anything where there's a lot of

131
00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:13.610
Anthony Taylor: education can use this 100%, right? Lots of text and education.

132
00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.010
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

133
00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.870
Anthony Taylor: so a few Nlp applications.

134
00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:29.199
Anthony Taylor:  so basically, if we have text, we can classify it. And then we can output what that text is. Okay.

135
00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:33.350
Anthony Taylor: one of the things like, you know, information extraction.

136
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.040
Anthony Taylor: So this is a big one.

137
00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:40.189
Anthony Taylor: and this is kind of like what Clayton I were just talking about. We put in a bunch of jargon.

138
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:46.330
Anthony Taylor: and we asked it to simplify it. extract what's important and simplify

139
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:48.969
Anthony Taylor: the way it goes.

140
00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:53.899
Clayton Graves: Interesting exercise would be to like, take the the the

141
00:14:54.190 --> 00:15:00.850
Clayton Graves: user agreement from Facebook or whatever, and plug that in and set and see what it says.

142
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:11.300
Anthony Taylor: Oh, I guarantee you it was summarized right, I mean, and you know, as far as the system shouldn't have an opinion they should be based on fact.

143
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:19.259
Anthony Taylor:  though you can tell your AI to be snarky. I've done that. I will tell you that becomes annoying quickly.

144
00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:27.320
Anthony Taylor: Don't do that very often. It's like, respond with a snorky comment every time. And you're like, Oh, my God, just tell me the answer.

145
00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:29.880
Anthony Taylor: yeah, don't do

146
00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:37.510
Anthony Taylor:  document summarization. Now, this is something we're doing a lot of these days, right? The new bing chat stuff.

147
00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:48.019
Anthony Taylor: I mean, it's so amazing for this, because you can just come in here and just say, Give me a summary. You go to an article like, Oh, that's an 8 min read.

148
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:53.610
Anthony Taylor: I want it to be a 1 min read I'm and from the Tiktok generation. right?

149
00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.220
Anthony Taylor: So there's that.

150
00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:04.109
Anthony Taylor: Complex questions. So this is a big one, too, and we're doing this more with Llm again.

151
00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:12.340
Anthony Taylor: You can do this with just the base and lp, but it's not gonna be as good at it. But this is like I'm going to upload.

152
00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:19.830
Anthony Taylor: you know, a bunch of reports like medical reports or research papers, and then I'm going to chat with them.

153
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.099
Anthony Taylor: Okay, all of that is done with, you know people.

154
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.650
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

155
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:34.470
Anthony Taylor: I love this line. and Nlp is hard. Okay.

156
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:38.379
Anthony Taylor:  it is. It's just hard.

157
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:52.969
Anthony Taylor: Alright! Why is it hard? Because we are freaking, weird man, English teachers and the people who came up with the rules of English of every language, but English more so than most languages.

158
00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:55.159
Anthony Taylor: We're like high or something.

159
00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:00.309
Anthony Taylor: Okay. They had. No, I mean, it was like, well, let's just

160
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.489
Anthony Taylor: make this word being that word. Okay?

161
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:07.009
Anthony Taylor: Right? Like bark on a tree.

162
00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:12.459
Anthony Taylor: We all know what that means. We can even visualize it when we say it.

163
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.399
Clayton Graves: So what about a dog bark.

164
00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.220
Clayton Graves: Let me ask you this.

165
00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:20.609
Clayton Graves: are there other languages that are easier

166
00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.829
Clayton Graves: to interpret

167
00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:33.540
Anthony Taylor: from a computer standpoint? Yes, yes, there would be words that you know, languages that don't have reuse of words or homonyms, or, you know, but

168
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:45.829
Anthony Taylor: but almost all languages have slain and state like like I was doing like bark up a tree or bark of a tree, a dog spark? Or how about barking up the wrong?

169
00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:48.769
Anthony Taylor: Whatever? However, that saying goes

170
00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:58.909
Anthony Taylor: right. that that's, you know, all of those things mean something totally different. But they all using the same word, and we expect. But we.

171
00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:05.859
Anthony Taylor: as humans. our minds very quickly associate those with where they go.

172
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:12.410
Anthony Taylor: Oh, barking up the wrong truth! That's what it was. Barking up. The wrong tree has nothing to do with a tree or a dog.

173
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.590
Anthony Taylor: And yet it has both those words in it.

174
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.930
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so

175
00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.460
Anthony Taylor: it's just hard.

176
00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:25.379
Anthony Taylor: Alright, and and that's the challenge. Yeah.

177
00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.330
Baro, Sonja: before you move on

178
00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:32.330
Baro, Sonja: hand disappears in your background. That's the problem.

179
00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:49.509
Baro, Sonja: Oh, I'll change. Yeah, no, no. I'm asking about is Nlp, what is used in large language, Ma language models so large language model is like a big

180
00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:56.410
Baro, Sonja: encompassing model. It utilizes Nlp within it. Is that the way to think about it

181
00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:16.420
Anthony Taylor: and lp this and lp, that you're learning today is the beginning of how the large language models became what they are to day. So we're going to work through this one. And I mean, people still use this one, because computationally, this is way easier and cheaper than the Llms. Llms. Cost

182
00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:18.919
Anthony Taylor: millions of dollars just to train.

183
00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:27.630
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But yeah, so this is a really this. And this works great for a lot of use cases

184
00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:35.670
Baro, Sonja: that's important. It's not equivalent. They're not the same Llm is like uses, you know.

185
00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:36.930
Baro, Sonja: Right? Okay.

186
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:47.370
Anthony Taylor: okay. But it it has some more advanced concepts that we'll talk about later. Okay? But right now we're yeah. Right now, we're we're kind of like.

187
00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:48.920
Anthony Taylor: you know, probably

188
00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:56.899
Anthony Taylor: 30, 40 years ago. And we're like, okay, how can we get our computer to understand what the heck is being said here.

189
00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

190
00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:05.220
Anthony Taylor: as opposed to where we really are today, where our computer completely and totally understands what we're saying.

191
00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:13.380
Anthony Taylor: Even when we say something really lame, like my my ex-wife, she used to drive me crazy.

192
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:23.970
Anthony Taylor: There was this shopping center in Irvine. and there was this nail salon. It was between a Thai restaurant and a donut shop.

193
00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:28.420
Anthony Taylor: Okay, very nice shopping center. And

194
00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:40.349
Anthony Taylor: she asked me, she goes, do you remember the name of that mail. I said, no, I have no idea. And she goes Google. What's the name of that mail place between the ice car, the doughnut shop and the Thai restaurant. That's all, she said.

195
00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:55.120
Anthony Taylor: and it figured it out what the heck she was talking about. And I'm like these things are freaking amazing sometimes. But then there's other times. And you ask, like the most simple thing. And it's like. Did you want fries with that? It has no idea, just no idea.

196
00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.740
Anthony Taylor: Right? So

197
00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:59.849
Anthony Taylor: it's interesting. Okay,

198
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:07.299
Anthony Taylor: yeah. I don't understand why they want to say that. So we're not gonna worry about that one.

199
00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:23.220
Masarirambi, Rodney: I wonder if I wonder if the complexity, like like Esperance, is it Esperanto? The universal language? I wonder whether that would actually be like a better one? For.

200
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.300
Masarirambi, Rodney: Yeah, it's the one which they

201
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:32.720
Anthony Taylor: go ahead.

202
00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:50.390
Masarirambi, Rodney: Oh, it's the one which they like developed somebody developed it. Get the guy's name in order to be able to like, have a new universal language that people communicate without like getting each other confusing. What's gonna be like, easier for everybody to learn, and there'll just be like one language that as humanity we can use

203
00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.900
Anthony Taylor: it is the world's most widely spoken language.

204
00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:59.370
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna be honest, I never.

205
00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:03.449
Anthony Taylor: It's been around since 1887.

206
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.200
Anthony Taylor: Interesting? No, I haven't heard of that. That's pretty cool, though.

207
00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:15.479
Anthony Taylor: And I would say, Yeah, any language that is less ambiguous, less slain.

208
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:18.579
Anthony Taylor: right? Less hominids, less.

209
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:31.679
Anthony Taylor:  just just all of these, all of these things that make our language difficult to understand will absolutely be easier, but they still are gonna go through the same steps. We're gonna go through today.

210
00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:34.980
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And we solved this problem.

211
00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:36.800
Anthony Taylor: We solved it already.

212
00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:40.600
Anthony Taylor: right? We're just not going to solve it in this. So this week?

213
00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:50.840
Anthony Taylor:  yeah. So bottom line is to solve all these problems, we need to really

214
00:22:51.010 --> 00:23:05.239
Anthony Taylor: organize and prepare our data for the model that we're going to send it into. So what do we do? Well, we're going to preprocess. Okay, then we're going to extract, get interesting features of the text. That sounds

215
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:12.250
Anthony Taylor: like something you guys like, maybe an objective thing. It is not okay.

216
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:19.700
Anthony Taylor: it you'll understand as we see it. I'm going to summarize these. Sorry you find interesting, exactly

217
00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:23.040
Anthony Taylor: interesting, as in interesting to the computer.

218
00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:30.180
Anthony Taylor: Okay, not interesting, as in Wow. That speech by Curry Gardner was excellent.

219
00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:31.320
Anthony Taylor: No.

220
00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:36.019
Anthony Taylor: okay, not that. Why is it interesting to the computer?

221
00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:44.589
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to visualize the analyses. In other words, we're not going to get charts. We're simply going to look and see what the heck it came up with.

222
00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:47.230
Anthony Taylor: So the first step

223
00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:50.190
Anthony Taylor: take that first step.

224
00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.010
Anthony Taylor: This is not the first step.

225
00:23:53.530 --> 00:24:00.120
Anthony Taylor: first step is tokenization. But before we do dopantization, what is a corpus? I know we got people know what this is.

226
00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:03.040
Anthony Taylor: what is a Corpus

227
00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.240
michael mcpherson: Christy's big brother

228
00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.750
Anthony Taylor: Meredith.

229
00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.160
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Doesn't it mean body?

230
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:19.009
Anthony Taylor: Who probably. But in this particular case

231
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:21.209
Anthony Taylor: we're looking for

232
00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:27.110
Anthony Taylor: a large, structured and organized collection of text documents.

233
00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:34.610
Anthony Taylor: See, that's why I'm like

234
00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:36.750
Anthony Taylor: I. That's why I was kind of like.

235
00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.830
Anthony Taylor: maybe.

236
00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:49.069
Anthony Taylor: But in this particular case it specifically means a body of work. of text documents, organized collection of text documents.

237
00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:53.190
Anthony Taylor:  and it could be multilingual. It doesn't matter.

238
00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:54.320
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

239
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:58.380
Anthony Taylor: so let's keep going.

240
00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:11.170
Anthony Taylor: The process of saying running into words. That is tokenization. What does that mean? So if I have a book filled with sentences, and I want tokenize it by sentence.

241
00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:13.309
Anthony Taylor: I would basically break

242
00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:15.759
Anthony Taylor: or split my data

243
00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:22.810
Anthony Taylor: by sentence. Everybody know how to do that. How do you do that with Python?

244
00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:26.130
Anthony Taylor: I practically gave it away of it.

245
00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:28.769
Anthony Taylor: Derek knows I can feel it.

246
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:35.789
Anthony Taylor: You make lists, maybe. How would you split an entire book by sentence?

247
00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:43.180
michael mcpherson: There it is, split, split on the periods.

248
00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:47.100
Anthony Taylor: There we go. Derek got it split.

249
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:49.949
Anthony Taylor: What if there was a question mark or an exclamation?

250
00:25:51.370 --> 00:26:06.100
Anthony Taylor: That's okay. I still, that was the answer. I was looking for Derek.  so. But we don't always. We don't actually stop at sentences. We often go down to words, and occasionally, when possible, we'll try to get phrases.

251
00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:12.889
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now, punctuations often got rid of usually don't want punctuation.

252
00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.699
Anthony Taylor: Okay, computer doesn't understand it, anyway.

253
00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:22.390
Anthony Taylor: Sentence and segmentation tokenization are usually the first step.

254
00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:27.310
Anthony Taylor: So let's eat grandpa. There it is. Let's eat, grandpa. Let's eat grandpa

255
00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:31.470
Anthony Taylor: alright, for those of us that are grandpa's.

256
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:33.620
Anthony Taylor: That's disturbing.

257
00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:37.469
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I am not a good.

258
00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:38.559
Anthony Taylor: so I don't care.

259
00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:41.940
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

260
00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:48.580
Anthony Taylor: it's a process splitting up text document. Most often sentences are worth. Okay.

261
00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.510
Anthony Taylor: let's

262
00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:53.829
Anthony Taylor: do some coding.

263
00:26:56.130 --> 00:27:06.209
Anthony Taylor: One of these is broken, but it's really easy to fix, so don't worry, I can tell you, when we get to it, or when you get. I already fixed it, and I can't remember which one it was. So would you guys find it?

264
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:07.290
Anthony Taylor: We'll fix

265
00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:09.260
Anthony Taylor: alright. So

266
00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:11.380
Anthony Taylor: this first little part here

267
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:22.210
Anthony Taylor: we're we're using a corpus from Reuters. The important thing here really is this and Nltka. This stands for national natural language, Kit.

268
00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:31.120
Anthony Taylor: And it'll be what we're going to use to process the preprocess our data. We're gonna import this Reuters

269
00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:35.400
Anthony Taylor: corpus. It's got lots of cool articles from Reuters.

270
00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:44.629
Anthony Taylor: and we're going to bring from the tokenize package. We're going to bring in sentence tokenizer and word tokenize.

271
00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:48.579
Anthony Taylor: Okay, these are methods we're going to use to tokenize

272
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:54.920
Anthony Taylor: our article. So let's run that. And it'll bring in the data. And it's amazing.

273
00:27:55.390 --> 00:28:01.289
Anthony Taylor: We can actually look at all the categories in our corpus. There's a lot of

274
00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.410
Anthony Taylor: lot of stuff to choose from.

275
00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:24.120
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're going to keep it simple. We're going to get coco, and we're going to grab the first article. So in the if we just grab coco by itself, we would have a list of articles. We just want the first article. So let's let's take a look.

276
00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:31.369
Anthony Taylor: and we got the name of it. It is test slash 1 5 0 9 5

277
00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:38.980
Anthony Taylor: to grab the content of the article we're going to use Reuters raw method and pass in the name of the article.

278
00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:40.710
Anthony Taylor: And there, Anthony.

279
00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:49.800
Baro, Sonja: is there like a master key to the categories like, how do you know what? Some of these simply, the.

280
00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:54.160
Baro, Sonja: I would say, could be in the read me or

281
00:28:55.500 --> 00:29:00.949
Anthony Taylor: no. No, no, I think that's a great I I'm sure there probably is.

282
00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:02.099
Anthony Taylor: Let's go look

283
00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:08.879
Baro, Sonja: like copra, Kate. I don't know what that is what kind of category.

284
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.840
Anthony Taylor: Look at all the ones they have, too. It's like.

285
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:21.290
Baro, Sonja: and is it defined by the method or the library that we are importing.

286
00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:27.150
Anthony Taylor: No, that that? Well, yeah. By the one that we're bringing in.

287
00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:29.789
Anthony Taylor: Hold on. I'm looking for the Reuters. One

288
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:33.840
Anthony Taylor: twoters Brown.

289
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:50.600
Masarirambi, Rodney: I gotta say, I've always. Everybody who I know is always pronounced in Reuters.

290
00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:54.130
Masarirambi, Rodney: It's probably Reuters, but I like

291
00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:04.680
Anthony Taylor: it's probably right now. I'm gonna feel bad about it. So

292
00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.129
Anthony Taylor: thank you for that.

293
00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:08.670
Clayton Graves: I've always said rudders, too. So

294
00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:13.940
Anthony Taylor: II think I think when you said it, I'm like.

295
00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:14.960
Okay.

296
00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:30.509
Anthony Taylor:  there's got to be. I can look and see we don't have to. No, no, no, I'm actually interested, and I think it's I think it's worth looking at, or I wouldn't stop to do it. I just wanted to see. Everything's going back to

297
00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:38.409
everything's going back to because it's used in in Ltk.

298
00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:46.110
Anthony Taylor: Everything's kind of going back to there. see, everything's like national English processing. Oh, you want to talk about national. Okay.

299
00:30:52.420 --> 00:31:03.680
Anthony Taylor: yeah. You know what? Maybe I'll try to hunt it down for you. Cause. Now, I don't know all of that info, or where to get the info on that, but I'm sure it's out. would make sense, because there is a lot of categories there.

300
00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:10.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so let's continue. So here's that article quite long. Okay.

301
00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:12.990
Anthony Taylor: pretty exciting.

302
00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:23.990
Anthony Taylor: First, we're going to just mimic tokenization. So note, we're not using our word tokenizer or our sentence tokenizer. We're just going to split it.

303
00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.460
Anthony Taylor: It's all we're gonna do.

304
00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:29.869
Anthony Taylor: Bam, and look at that. We have a list in the list

305
00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:32.530
Anthony Taylor: is one sentence at a time.

306
00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:38.130
Anthony Taylor: That's pretty easy. Yeah. I think so.

307
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:43.709
Clayton Graves:  is it doing the slash cause? It's a new line

308
00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:50.720
Anthony Taylor: that indicates a new line in our text. Okay, as in someone hit the enter key

309
00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:53.710
Anthony Taylor: on a Linux box or a Mac

310
00:31:54.280 --> 00:32:04.130
Anthony Taylor: on windows box, it'd be slash, R. Slash. Don't let that bother. Okay. Alright. Now, if you just want to. Let's just look at. Let's just look at one sip.

311
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:17.619
Anthony Taylor: Oh, actually, we're going to go a step further. We're going to take the first sentence, and then we're going to split it by word into words by using the split on the space. So now we have a list of all the words

312
00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:20.210
Anthony Taylor: in the first sentence.

313
00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:23.749
Anthony Taylor: Technically, this is tokenized.

314
00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:31.270
Anthony Taylor: Okay, very rudimentary lots of little issues here that we're gonna go through.

315
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:37.169
Anthony Taylor: But one of them is and Clayton pointed it out, pointed it out, look at these slash ins in here.

316
00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:48.370
Anthony Taylor: Okay, these are not helpful at all.  we've got empty space. Got a lot of stuff that's

317
00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:52.300
Anthony Taylor: questionable. Okay? So

318
00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:59.059
Anthony Taylor: here comes hence tokenize, which is basically short for sentence tokenization.

319
00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:06.249
Anthony Taylor: We're going to take the same article and run it. Now. What did it do? Well, it looks like it did the same thing.

320
00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:09.110
Anthony Taylor: However, it's kind of weird

321
00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:13.600
Anthony Taylor: and did do a better job with the new lines. Wouldn't you agree?

322
00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:16.350
Anthony Taylor: Maybe

323
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:20.360
Anthony Taylor: it did. They're not at the end. But notice, there's still, some in the middle

324
00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:25.890
Anthony Taylor: that's going to turn out to be a problem eventually. But we'll take care of it. Yeah, it's not

325
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:37.639
Baro, Sonja: I don't know if anyone else is having this. But the file I downloaded doesn't have this next section that you're in in the salt.

326
00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:41.510
Anthony Taylor: am I? Here?

327
00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.050
Baro, Sonja: Yeah, it stops at.

328
00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:53.459
Baro, Sonja: We can tokenize the first sentence with word tokenize, and then it goes into questions.

329
00:33:53.880 --> 00:34:03.669
Baro, Sonja: yeah, oh, sorry. I'm sorry. That's okay. So here, here we got the sense. So we did the sentences

330
00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:12.090
Anthony Taylor: and then. Now we're just going to take the first sentence and cut it into a word Tokenizer. Let's take a look at what we got out of that.

331
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.640
Anthony Taylor: Oh, but look!

332
00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:19.100
Anthony Taylor: All those new lines are gone. Now

333
00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:20.850
Anthony Taylor: here's another weird problem.

334
00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:23.520
Anthony Taylor: See what happened there.

335
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:28.460
Anthony Taylor: It isolated those symbols, because it's like, I don't know what you want me to do with that.

336
00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:33.139
Anthony Taylor: Okay, what about the capitals? What about all these caps?

337
00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:43.610
Anthony Taylor: Now, if we were to look at the Ascii code, for each of these are, Is this a the same as this? A.

338
00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.620
Anthony Taylor: Not at all.

339
00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:51.780
Anthony Taylor: So eventually we may want to address the the capitalization in all of these as well. Yeah.

340
00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:54.070
Anthony Taylor: alright.

341
00:34:55.080 --> 00:35:01.760
Anthony Taylor: aye. tokenization. Right now, all we're worried about sentences and words.

342
00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:05.539
Anthony Taylor: You guys get to do it. Now I'm going to warn you.

343
00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:10.380
Anthony Taylor: They're gonna make you do a for loop

344
00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:18.699
Anthony Taylor: to get all the words for each story and add the words to a list. So remember, you got to create an empty list. You're in a pen, the blah blah blah.

345
00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:22.489
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then.

346
00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:34.560
Anthony Taylor: yeah, this is, it's we'll see how you guys do with it. If you get. Don't get too hung up on this. Just make sure you could do what I showed you.

347
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:39.729
Anthony Taylor:  there is some extra steps in here that we did not cover.

348
00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:45.440
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but it is stuff you've done before. So you should be okay.

349
00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:49.250
Anthony Taylor: And it's okay. If you're not, don't feel bad.

350
00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:50.939
Anthony Taylor: We're going to get through it.

351
00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:59.740
Anthony Taylor:  just looking for the timer. Okay, 15 min.

352
00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:04.010
Anthony Taylor: Let me set you guys up. Was it easy for everybody? Everyone was like

353
00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:05.450
Anthony Taylor: cakewalk

354
00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:09.719
Mason, Natalie: was a challenge, but we were tackling it.

355
00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:13.710
Anthony Taylor: Guys are amazing.

356
00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:16.409
Anthony Taylor: I saw freaking Maisie.

357
00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:22.090
Anthony Taylor:  thank you for informing us

358
00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.049
Anthony Taylor: we're going to move on.

359
00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.280
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

360
00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:27.570
Anthony Taylor: so

361
00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:42.150
Anthony Taylor: let's do it. I don't think that's true. Okay, so here we go. Bringing all the same stuff we did in the an instructor example. Gonna look at the categories.

362
00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:48.720
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, instructor example. the file id, this time it said, do income. So it's a little different.

363
00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:54.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now, this one has a whole bunch of different articles, not just one.

364
00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:57.380
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So

365
00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:05.750
Anthony Taylor: it says, get all raw stories and id meetings in a separate list. You didn't have to list comprehension if you did, that's great.

366
00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:20.019
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But basically for every id in the list. I want to grab it and put it in a list for the stories. Then I'm gonna get rid of this test. Portion of it says, remove the text

367
00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:29.950
Anthony Taylor: we're going to use replace for that. We're going to end up with a really cool list of just ideas. Okay?

368
00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:42.549
Anthony Taylor:  then we're going to do our sentence tokenizer for each one. So we're going to say, Hey, for every story in raw stories.

369
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:46.169
Anthony Taylor: do sentence. Tokenizer put it in a list.

370
00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:47.380
Anthony Taylor: bam.

371
00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:53.369
Anthony Taylor: Now I don't know why they didn't show you that you think they could have done that. Okay, don't do that.

372
00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:55.180
Anthony Taylor: Let's just do it right here.

373
00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:00.650
Anthony Taylor: That's not it. D. There we go?

374
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:05.039
Anthony Taylor: Did I not just do this? Said

375
00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:15.250
Anthony Taylor: hike sentence tokenized? Thank you. There we go. So you can see them all. They look really great. Okay.

376
00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:18.720
Anthony Taylor: Now we're going to take each one of those

377
00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:24.880
Anthony Taylor: and get the words out of it. Okay, so we have word tokenized list.

378
00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:33.130
Anthony Taylor: We're going to create a loop. We're gonna go for sentence and story words equals

379
00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:41.419
Anthony Taylor: words, and I'll explain that, plus the tokenized words and then append that to here. So

380
00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.550
Anthony Taylor: every sentence. So the first sentence goes, does everybody.

381
00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:49.040
Anthony Taylor: does anybody want me to explain this, or is this clear?

382
00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:52.899
Anthony Taylor: Let me ask that I don't want to explain it? If it. If everybody gets it.

383
00:38:54.100 --> 00:39:03.849
Anthony Taylor: what you guys think I would, I would appreciate an explanation. I think that's a wonderful okay, good. Okay. So words in the first loop

384
00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:10.110
Anthony Taylor: is basically empty. Right? Well, technically, it's an empty list.

385
00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.320
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

386
00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:21.049
Anthony Taylor: it's gonna do. Words is empty equals this empty list, plus, it's going to tokenize the first sentence.

387
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:25.470
Anthony Taylor: And it's gonna put all those into here.

388
00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:37.960
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So first sentence, whatever that was Yugoslav economy worsened in 1986 bank data shows blah, blah, blah, blah blah all be word, word, word, word, word, word, word. Okay.

389
00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:39.730
Anthony Taylor: Second sentence.

390
00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:50.250
Anthony Taylor: So to come through here again. This has all of the words from the first sentence right here, plus all the words from the second sentence

391
00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:56.010
Anthony Taylor: that gets put in there. Got it? Next sentence

392
00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:03.490
Anthony Taylor: comes to here. This has all the words from the first sentence, and the second. let's add all the words from the third.

393
00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:07.410
Anthony Taylor: and so on until we get through the entire thing.

394
00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:12.979
Anthony Taylor: ultimately ending with a list of all the works.

395
00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:17.579
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that will get appended.

396
00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:20.869
Clayton Graves: That certainly. Right.

397
00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:32.389
Anthony Taylor: That's every word of the entire article at that point and all. Yes, and everything that we just did the sentence Tokenizer on. We're now going to do

398
00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:38.590
Anthony Taylor: the word tokenizer on. So let's run that. And you can see. Now look at what you end up

399
00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:42.529
Anthony Taylor: right. Every word is its own thing.

400
00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:44.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

401
00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:52.780
Mason, Natalie: Anthony, can you? Can you please scroll up to the cell above that one. I missed the last part

402
00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:56.060
Mason, Natalie: for I and Ross. Okay, thank you so much.

403
00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:57.979
Anthony Taylor: Oh, that one. Okay, good.

404
00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:09.610
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So then it says, and this is what we didn't do for sure. Put the raw stories to tokenized sentences and the words into a data frame. So raw stories was a list we created up here

405
00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:13.310
Anthony Taylor: right here because we did list comprehension.

406
00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.730
Anthony Taylor: then, for sentence tokenized, we did list comprehension.

407
00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:25.219
Anthony Taylor: and then for word tokenize. We created a list and appended all of our words. So we have 3 lists

408
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:27.700
Anthony Taylor: and

409
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:31.070
Anthony Taylor:  3 column headers.

410
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:37.120
Anthony Taylor: Okay. make the index story ids and run it.

411
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:44.089
Anthony Taylor: Then there you go. Now. The interesting thing is, there's obviously there's more words.

412
00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:48.600
Anthony Taylor: There's more sentences in raw stories is like, there's one story

413
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:58.289
Anthony Taylor: right in that one story. There might be a hundred sentences in that 100 sentences there might be a thousand words. Okay, that's extreme. No, that's not extreme.

414
00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:05.659
Anthony Taylor: But so these are in this column. This is a list of all the sentences, and this is a list of all the words

415
00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:07.270
Anthony Taylor: alright.

416
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:09.340
Anthony Taylor: So

417
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:16.070
Anthony Taylor: this is the first step in and N lp, to get us to to get us to a point where we can.

418
00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:22.739
Anthony Taylor: We're getting closer. We're we're now breaking it down. So the computer is going to receive these words individually.

419
00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:35.320
Anthony Taylor: Alright, they it doesn't, it does not. We're gonna talk a little bit about in grams later, where it looks at more than one word, but for the most part it's looking at one word at the top.

420
00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:40.610
Anthony Taylor: Okay. let's see if we got any slides to show for this next part.

421
00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:54.169
Anthony Taylor: Don't think we do any questions about that before I move on feeling okay with tokenizing. It's basically just splitting the words up for you the reason we use a tokenizer instead of split

422
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:59.740
Anthony Taylor: because we can. It does a little better job at taking care of like carriage returns and stuff like that.

423
00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:05.889
Anthony Taylor: plus sentence. Tokenizer understands question marks, exclamation points.

424
00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:18.880
Anthony Taylor: stuff like that. Well, if we did it with split we'd have to take into account all those possibilities. Anthony, and can you go back to the code? Will you show the part where you did the

425
00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:23.690
Meredith McCanse (she/her): a little higher where you did the sentence, tokenize the stories.

426
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:28.429
Meredith McCanse (she/her): This one? Yeah.

427
00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:33.159
Anthony Taylor: So remember, this is just a for loop. So you write the for loop first, I want

428
00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:35.510
Anthony Taylor: every raw story.

429
00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:41.099
Anthony Taylor: and then I want to apply the sentence tokenizer method to each story.

430
00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.270
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay.

431
00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:53.839
Anthony Taylor: got it. I mean, if if this is easier, guys write it out in variables that you'd like for story and raw stories. Sentence tokenized

432
00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:55.090
Anthony Taylor: the story.

433
00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:57.770
Anthony Taylor: It'll work exactly the same.

434
00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:07.780
Anthony Taylor: And then, if down here instead of well, no, this is pretty clear. We're talking nice sentence.

435
00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:09.260
Anthony Taylor: and there you go

436
00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:13.139
Anthony Taylor: pretty cool.

437
00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:17.620
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Thank you.

438
00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:19.340
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Derek.

439
00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:27.179
Derek Rikke: I think maybe you just said this. But do you have to do the sentence one before the word one.

440
00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:32.710
Anthony Taylor: Can. You just skip straight to the word one. They are intentionally.

441
00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:37.329
Anthony Taylor: I would say. The answer is, probably

442
00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:44.969
Anthony Taylor: you would be okay doing the word one by itself, cause it just creates one list for the entire story.

443
00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:55.630
Anthony Taylor: We are at the moment, and and I will tell you don't need to do this. but we are at the moment breaking it down by sentence first, just to be intentional about it.

444
00:44:55.730 --> 00:45:03.789
Anthony Taylor: But no, I'm pretty sure you can just do the words without. In fact. Here, let's just do this. Let's try it.

445
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:09.480
We're took for story and raw stories.

446
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:16.129
Anthony Taylor: word, sentence and story. Let's try.

447
00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:20.370
Anthony Taylor: Oh. interesting!

448
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:27.689
Anthony Taylor: II would say I I'm gonna stick to my guns on this one, though I don't know the syntax off top my head.

449
00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:29.969
Anthony Taylor: I'm pretty sure you can do that.

450
00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:33.209
Anthony Taylor: I see what it's doing.

451
00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:36.639
Anthony Taylor: but what you could probably do.

452
00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:44.200
Anthony Taylor: Here, let's try one more thing. Now, now I'm now I'm determine to try this.

453
00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:51.589
Anthony Taylor: I said. I'm pretty fairly certain we could figure this out if we wanted to mess with it.

454
00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:57.030
Anthony Taylor: It doesn't like that. Oh, but one more thing

455
00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:06.500
Anthony Taylor: we could

456
00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:16.330
Anthony Taylor: see here.

457
00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:26.530
Anthony Taylor: this might work. But basically we're still breaking it down, since I still think there's a way to do what? What? You're asking defects?

458
00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:29.320
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So that would work.

459
00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:31.169
Anthony Taylor: So you don't have to do it twice.

460
00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:36.240
Anthony Taylor:  but I kind of think there's a way to do it directly.

461
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:37.950
Anthony Taylor: trying to remember.

462
00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:42.959
Anthony Taylor: Anyway, it's not that big a deal, cause you can't do it this way.

463
00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:44.480
Derek Rikke: Alright, thanks.

464
00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:46.349
Anthony Taylor: No, not a problem.

465
00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:51.969
Anthony Taylor: Hi. Any other questions. Before we move on to the next coolness.

466
00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:55.379
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna do some more coolness. Bye.

467
00:46:56.650 --> 00:46:58.080
Anthony Taylor: what I just did here.

468
00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:59.050
michael mcpherson: Yes.

469
00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:01.160
Anthony Taylor: certainly.

470
00:47:03.350 --> 00:47:04.250
michael mcpherson: Thank you.

471
00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:08.050
Anthony Taylor: Absolutely, sir.

472
00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:16.860
Anthony Taylor: Done.

473
00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:20.190
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

474
00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:27.369
Anthony Taylor: Stop words. Did I? Did. I find stop words. Okay. So

475
00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:31.450
Anthony Taylor: stopword sounds ominous, I know.

476
00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:34.109
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but it's not

477
00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:37.360
Anthony Taylor: a word you use to stop something you don't like.

478
00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:42.869
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I think those are called safe words. I don't know one of those, but I don't think we do that in lp.

479
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:45.270
Anthony Taylor: stop words. Okay.

480
00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:51.659
Anthony Taylor: so stop. Words are words that that the computer just could care less about.

481
00:47:52.740 --> 00:48:03.739
Anthony Taylor: Alright. They should be like non-words. But they're real words. So what does that mean? So for analysis purposes, they have no information. They're not adding anything.

482
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:12.480
Anthony Taylor: Okay, things like the there in a

483
00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:15.410
Anthony Taylor: alright.

484
00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:18.460
Anthony Taylor: Those are all words

485
00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:21.630
Anthony Taylor: at all words.

486
00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:27.589
Clayton Graves: These are words that you would skip when you're in a speed reading class.

487
00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:31.890
Anthony Taylor: Probably. Yeah, I would say, that makes sense.

488
00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:39.990
Anthony Taylor:  why is this new?

489
00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:41.230
Anthony Taylor: Sorry?

490
00:48:42.330 --> 00:48:53.899
Anthony Taylor: Okay, absolutely. And we just like get rid of them. Because from a computing standpoint, they're just noise. They don't add anything, and they're very, very, very pumped

491
00:48:53.910 --> 00:49:00.219
Anthony Taylor: this to the A there, and to be surprised at how common these are.

492
00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:07.380
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And in our situation, at least at Nlp. At this point

493
00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:15.379
Anthony Taylor: these very common words, since they don't help. they they don't have context. They don't add anything. We're not looking for context right now.

494
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:22.029
Anthony Taylor: And that's an important distinction between what we're doing now and what we're going to do in a couple or next week. Pretty much.

495
00:49:22.310 --> 00:49:26.580
Anthony Taylor: Okay? In a week or 2 we're gonna be looking for context.

496
00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:33.330
Anthony Taylor: That's the big. And that's the big advancement that happened, you know, recently. relatively

497
00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:37.460
Anthony Taylor: in in lp, is it figured out? They figured out

498
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.780
Anthony Taylor: how to get context.

499
00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:49.180
Anthony Taylor: But right now, that's not what we're doing, literally just trying to look at the individual words.  yeah.

500
00:49:49.440 --> 00:50:02.800
Anthony Taylor: alright. And then we jump into a demo. So how do we do this? Well, the good news is this is not hard at all. Okay? Oh, look! I figured out which one is messed up.

501
00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:07.470
Anthony Taylor:  do I have it still messed up?

502
00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:10.249
Anthony Taylor: The one you guys have?

503
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:13.370
Anthony Taylor: Yeah,

504
00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:18.510
Anthony Taylor: so yours says phoned right here, right? Or something

505
00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:22.789
Anthony Taylor: that's wrong. Change it to Gutenberg.

506
00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:26.550
Anthony Taylor: Otherwise it's Gonna break when you get to the second cell.

507
00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:28.850
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

508
00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:32.669
Clayton Graves: there's another one further down.

509
00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:43.779
Clayton Graves: Hold on a second. That also, says Gutenberg, or is it another doubt? So there's there's there's Pump T. There's Gutenberg, and there's stop words.

510
00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:49.169
Anthony Taylor: Right? So you want this one in the download? You don't need post.

511
00:50:50.370 --> 00:50:57.090
Clayton Graves: Is there a download later? That does. I had to do a download on stop words.

512
00:50:58.330 --> 00:51:00.360
Anthony Taylor: Okay. interesting?

513
00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:07.059
Anthony Taylor: So anyway, we're we're not using the punk one. And I'll tell you this happens a lot throughout the

514
00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:13.349
Anthony Taylor: the thing. Oh, look now this one has. This one has a read me the Gutenberg.

515
00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:22.119
Anthony Taylor: which tells me that the Reuters see, now I want to talk with the New York accent. When I say reuters.

516
00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:25.280
Anthony Taylor: Reuters Rodney Reuters.

517
00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:28.310
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. Anyway.

518
00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:30.179
Anthony Taylor: that's a bad Newark accent.

519
00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:40.439
Anthony Taylor: All right. So we're gonna bring this in. Yay. we're going to look at the feel of the file Ids that are in here. This one has a lot of different text files.

520
00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:49.629
Anthony Taylor: Pretty cool. Look, Moby, Dick is in here. This is like books. This is pretty cool. Shakespeare's Caesar, Hamlet.

521
00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:51.340
Anthony Taylor: Macbeth.

522
00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:54.660
Anthony Taylor: This is cool. Okay.

523
00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:58.370
Anthony Taylor:  Then we're gonna grab

524
00:51:58.390 --> 00:52:00.730
Anthony Taylor: one of the books.

525
00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:05.659
Anthony Taylor: Okay, pretty cool again.

526
00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:08.299
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to tokenize

527
00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:17.280
Anthony Taylor: nothing special. We're just going to tokenize it. Sentence Tokenizer. Print one sentence here it is. He had been remarkably handsome in his shoe.

528
00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:20.389
Anthony Taylor: and at 54 let's do it. Wow!

529
00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:31.739
Anthony Taylor: They're just talking about me in this book. That's nice. You ain't No. 54

530
00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:34.769
Clayton Graves: 50 close enough.

531
00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:37.030
Anthony Taylor: anyway.

532
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:44.489
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so so that's a good sentence. So after we get that, we're gonna take the sentence, we're gonna

533
00:52:44.730 --> 00:52:49.639
Anthony Taylor: break it into words. So this is what we just did. No big deal. Okay. Next

534
00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:50.770
Anthony Taylor: stop.

535
00:52:52.170 --> 00:53:04.639
Anthony Taylor: we imported stop words up top. We're going to bring in the English, stop words and take a look at them. And you're going to see. These are the words you guys can scroll through. There's lot of them.

536
00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:06.500
A,

537
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:07.660
Anthony Taylor: yeah.

538
00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:10.870
Anthony Taylor: okay, there's a lot.

539
00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:16.329
Clayton Graves: Now, one of the things that I noticed is that when you tokenize the words

540
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:19.689
Clayton Graves: it did tokenize the punctuation too

541
00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:24.630
Anthony Taylor: correct, we're gonna take care of that also before this is over, I promise.

542
00:53:25.070 --> 00:53:27.650
Anthony Taylor: So there you go.

543
00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:29.230
Mason, Natalie: That's seldom

544
00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:36.000
Mason, Natalie: that cell isn't working for me. It says resource. Stop word it's not found.

545
00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:39.680
Anthony Taylor: Did you? Did you run this first one up here?

546
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:42.160
Mason, Natalie: I did.

547
00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:48.029
Clayton Graves: I had. I had to actually plug in an N. Ltk dot download.

548
00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:51.250
Clayton Graves: Stop words in my import cell

549
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:56.049
Clayton Graves: underneath the download. And then it worked

550
00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:58.699
Anthony Taylor: interesting. Try it.

551
00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:04.869
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. Maybe maybe because I've already downloaded it once. I don't have. Did anybody else have to do that?

552
00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:06.420
Baro, Sonja: Yeah, I did.

553
00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:07.820
Anthony Taylor: Oh.

554
00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:14.209
Anthony Taylor: well, I love that, that. All of you figure that out so easy. I don't. I don't remember. Maybe I did it.

555
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:17.369
Mason, Natalie: Okay. Good job. Team.

556
00:54:17.890 --> 00:54:20.139
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Oh, no, that's print

557
00:54:21.810 --> 00:54:24.539
Anthony Taylor: English stopword. Stop words. Yeah, I don't know why.

558
00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:26.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay, well, I'm glad that worked alright.

559
00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:32.730
Anthony Taylor: So this is stop words that we get built in. Okay.

560
00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:46.310
Anthony Taylor: so what we're gonna do is gonna filter out all the stopwords. So basically, we're going to for word in all words. So what's all words? All words is all these words that were in this sentence.

561
00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:48.970
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna go through each one of those words.

562
00:54:49.390 --> 00:54:52.960
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna we're going to filter

563
00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:56.549
Anthony Taylor: and say, if word not lower

564
00:54:56.680 --> 00:55:01.450
Anthony Taylor: is not in SW, this this set.

565
00:55:01.850 --> 00:55:02.890
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

566
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:07.119
Anthony Taylor: Then print it out and put it in this list.

567
00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:10.479
Clayton Graves: That's what this says. Remind me what the dot lower is.

568
00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:14.379
Clayton Graves: Oh, it's gonna make it lower case, we're gonna get to lowercase. Got it?

569
00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:15.630
Anthony Taylor: Yes.

570
00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:22.269
Anthony Taylor: okay. So we run that. And then we have just these words, we're left in that sense.

571
00:55:23.050 --> 00:55:26.309
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So they took out the pronouns

572
00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:33.180
Anthony Taylor: they took out had been they left remarkably handsome. Group 54. Still fine man.

573
00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:37.630
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Well, that's a problem, anyway.

574
00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:42.160
Anthony Taylor: so there you go. And that's what stopboards does.

575
00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:47.850
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's all it does. It's main point is to try to get any

576
00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:50.390
Anthony Taylor: junk out.

577
00:55:51.040 --> 00:56:02.530
Anthony Taylor: It's just reducing the noise like, that's what it's trying to do. It's trying to get. So basically, if we read this entire sentence, you'd been a remarkably handsome man, too.

578
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:05.659
Anthony Taylor: and at 54 was still a very fine man.

579
00:56:05.830 --> 00:56:07.529
Anthony Taylor: Does this say the same thing?

580
00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:12.070
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. The meeting is still there. 54 still find that

581
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:26.640
Anthony Taylor: it sounds like a caveman saying it right? It's still meaningful. You still understand what the sentence is saying. I know I'm still feeling like it's describing me 2 years ago. Okay, so

582
00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:34.550
Anthony Taylor: let's take a look. We can define our own list of stop words to add the default. So we can actually add more

583
00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:41.649
Anthony Taylor: alright. So we can actually do a stopwrit. Add on. Now, by the way, what is this

584
00:56:44.330 --> 00:56:46.030
Clayton Graves: dictionary dictionary?

585
00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:53.620
Clayton Graves: Why? Why? Is it? No, because in between there's no, there's no label value.

586
00:56:54.150 --> 00:57:00.070
Anthony Taylor: no key value. I love that. No key value pairs. No, this is actually a set.

587
00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:04.790
Anthony Taylor: Okay, no matter what a set is. So you have a list.

588
00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:11.760
Anthony Taylor: and then you have a set which is effectively a immutable list that removes duplicates.

589
00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:21.929
Anthony Taylor: So it's really. And it runs really fast by the I just thought I'd throw that out there. That's like trivia. We probably mentioned that once before. But

590
00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:30.699
Anthony Taylor: why not? Right? Okay. So we have this new add on. So how do we do this? Well, we're still going to do for word and all words.

591
00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:37.609
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna say, if we're lower little lower, not in. And we're just gonna union

592
00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:42.829
Anthony Taylor: the original stop words with our add-on words.

593
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.400
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then return it. And when we end up with

594
00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:50.580
Anthony Taylor: remarkably handsome youth. Fine man!

595
00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:59.929
Clayton Graves: See? I think the 54 yeah. See? That could be anybody. I think the 54 was important.

596
00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:03.899
Clayton Graves: I accept that. I don't know that it's that important.

597
00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:08.689
Clayton Graves: I just think it goes from describing someone like you to describing me.

598
00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:11.110
Anthony Taylor: That's true.

599
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:14.630
Anthony Taylor: You know what, Clayton. I'm gonna give that to you, man, that's good work.

600
00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:15.990
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

601
00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:33.019
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So that was really cool. Right? That's the eliminated the words and believe it or not, this could come up in a lot of places. We used to have one. We had all these virgin Atlantic tweets right, and every tweet had

602
00:58:33.070 --> 00:58:35.540
Anthony Taylor: at Urgentlet nothing to do with you. Naval

603
00:58:35.610 --> 00:58:37.400
Anthony Taylor: head at virginal it

604
00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:47.079
Mason, Natalie: right? Cause you do. You don't work for virgin Atlantic, though you work for Virginia. Probably my fault. I'm probably programming your algorithm. These are years ago, years ago.

605
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:51.060
Anthony Taylor: anyway. So every Tweet said at Virgin Atlantic

606
00:58:51.250 --> 00:59:01.119
Anthony Taylor: right? Well, that didn't mean anything to the Tweet. We all we knew they were all virgin planted tweets. So what did we do? We added at Virgin planted to the stop words.

607
00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:02.829
Anthony Taylor: They all went away.

608
00:59:03.610 --> 00:59:08.860
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so there's a lot of ways you can use. Stop words in that sense. Okay.

609
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:13.849
Anthony Taylor: I wish we spent a lot of time on this.

610
00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:15.250
Anthony Taylor: Yes, I'm

611
00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:33.919
Baro, Sonja: yeah. Before you move on the what we just did, though, when we removed the stop words. Was it just from the one sentence that we picked? Or

612
00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:37.319
Anthony Taylor: that would be my guess? Okay, alright

613
00:59:38.290 --> 00:59:54.560
Anthony Taylor: projects. So there, I'm gonna tell you a second on Udemy. And and it's funny I don't know why I told you guys this story years ago you, Demi, reached out to me and said, Hey, do you wanna like Qa, our

614
00:59:54.820 --> 00:59:56.140
Anthony Taylor: new classes?

615
00:59:56.730 --> 01:00:09.910
Anthony Taylor: Basically, they would send me classes that they hadn't published yet and say, Hey, can you look through this? Tell us what you think? Yeah, sure it was great, because and and and they paid me. But they also, I got all those classes. It was super cool.

616
01:00:10.050 --> 01:00:15.020
Anthony Taylor:  there was a regular expressions class. It was the coolest and classic.

617
01:00:16.410 --> 01:00:20.240
Anthony Taylor: It was 42 h long.

618
01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:29.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay, regular expressions is a big thing. There are entire books dedicated to regular expressions.

619
01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:31.369
Anthony Taylor: Now we've talked about them before or no.

620
01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:34.459
Anthony Taylor: Want to say, yeah, but no.

621
01:00:34.650 --> 01:00:50.369
Anthony Taylor: maybe a little bit alright. So the good news is we're not gonna get too deep in them right now. Just know if you want to do really fancy, like pattern matching and stuff regular expressions is a very cool thing to dig deeper into. There is a great course of it in

622
01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:57.419
Anthony Taylor: data. Can't. If you really want to. Okay, so we're going to import regular expressions library.

623
01:00:57.750 --> 01:01:01.510
Anthony Taylor: We're going to create. So this is a regular expression.

624
01:01:01.570 --> 01:01:14.409
Anthony Taylor: What this basically says is substitute anything that? Well, this is a pattern that says anything that's not a to Z lowercase a to z uppercase or a space.

625
01:01:16.410 --> 01:01:21.110
Anthony Taylor: That's what this expression says. This, this carrot is a not

626
01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:23.610
Anthony Taylor: okay.

627
01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:30.479
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to do Regex sub. So we're basically saying.

628
01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:38.820
Anthony Taylor: Get rid of anything that is not these things. And we're going to pass in.

629
01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:44.860
Anthony Taylor: The sentence. okay, so we have red Jacks compile

630
01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:48.020
Anthony Taylor: regex dot substitute.

631
01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:53.700
Anthony Taylor: And then what we want to look okay. and we're gonna print

632
01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:59.040
Anthony Taylor: alright exciting. We didn't show the sentence before.

633
01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:03.429
Anthony Taylor:  me do something here.

634
01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:12.440
Anthony Taylor: Actually, I'm gonna restart and clear everything

635
01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:17.739
Anthony Taylor: because I'm gonna bring it back to here and just show you the sentence beforehand.

636
01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:23.769
Anthony Taylor: just to remind you.

637
01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:36.039
Anthony Taylor: So there's the whole sentence right? Yeah. And remarkably, there's an under, there's a

638
01:02:36.850 --> 01:02:40.790
Anthony Taylor: a new line. Semi-colon, weird

639
01:02:40.830 --> 01:02:45.340
Anthony Taylor: comma, another comma. Okay, this

640
01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:47.340
Anthony Taylor: Augusta.

641
01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:52.989
Anthony Taylor: So we didn't have to know every possible non printable character.

642
01:02:53.780 --> 01:03:03.640
Anthony Taylor: That's the key here, otherwise we would have to know. Look for new lines, look for commas, look for semicolons, look for periods, look for I mean, we'd have to come up with a list of like every possible

643
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:06.299
Anthony Taylor: anything. That's not a letter.

644
01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:08.610
Anthony Taylor: Well, that's crazy. Just do this

645
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.690
Anthony Taylor: super easy. Okay. alright.

646
01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:26.049
Anthony Taylor:  we can also grab everything. So if you wanted. So in this case, instead of saying sub, we said, Fine.

647
01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:33.680
Anthony Taylor: okay, so we're basically saying, Give me everything in one sentence that is, not

648
01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:38.920
Anthony Taylor: a to ZA to Z or space. And it gave us this. This is what we got rid of, basically

649
01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:46.370
Anthony Taylor: pretty cool. You don't need. This is just it's just showing what it got rid of. Okay?

650
01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:49.480
Anthony Taylor: Oh.

651
01:03:50.410 --> 01:04:02.259
Anthony Taylor: so we can do it for a whole thing. We can do word tokenize. We're gonna word tokenize our re clean and then what are we doing

652
01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:06.069
Anthony Taylor: where we're tokenizing the new one?

653
01:04:06.590 --> 01:04:16.840
Anthony Taylor: And then for words in re words, oh, okay. And then we're just gonna go through and do our stop words.  And then that's what we end up.

654
01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:22.949
Anthony Taylor: Now, this is interesting. Look at what it did there.

655
01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:25.820
Anthony Taylor: Why did it do that?

656
01:04:28.330 --> 01:04:35.770
Anthony Taylor: Well, you guys see it, it's back to my age again. 54 in there, and it we took it out earlier. Right?

657
01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:42.580
Clayton Graves: Well, we did. But remember, we use the original sentence, so why.

658
01:04:42.730 --> 01:04:46.620
Clayton Graves: 2 separate words? We just remove the dash

659
01:04:46.890 --> 01:04:50.589
Anthony Taylor: right? And in the add on. We were actually looking

660
01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:54.400
Anthony Taylor: for 54 put together.

661
01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:55.600
Anthony Taylor: See? Right here.

662
01:04:56.150 --> 01:05:05.190
Anthony Taylor: Oh, okay. So is to be honest with, if I was coding this, I would look at that and go if I needed to take it out there, why would I leave it here?

663
01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:08.890
Anthony Taylor: Because now it means it makes less sense to.

664
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:14.549
Anthony Taylor: And then the age of 4

665
01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:16.619
Anthony Taylor: exactly. It could be 50,

666
01:05:16.690 --> 01:05:20.499
Anthony Taylor: 4, 5 min, 4 year old. They, kevin.

667
01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:32.600
Baro, Sonja: which none of us alright. Well, maybe teasing curry, cause I.

668
01:05:33.010 --> 01:05:38.349
Anthony Taylor: But no, what's important here is, look, this is youth 50 and 4 find

669
01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:41.660
Anthony Taylor: man. But I mean this could be

670
01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:43.920
Anthony Taylor: the number 50 and

671
01:05:44.010 --> 01:05:52.960
Anthony Taylor: 4 year old fine man for different. Find them so you'd have to add 50 and 4

672
01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:06.139
Clayton Graves: rather than the 50 dashboard. You'd add 54 up there and then down here. It would remove the dash when you strip out all of the punctuation and stuff.

673
01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:17.459
Anthony Taylor: I think basic. Yes, I still think, get rid of. 54 was a bad idea. So yeah, it makes it wrong. Cause I mean, if you are now 100,

674
01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:22.090
Anthony Taylor: this doesn't make sense anymore. It made more sense without the 54.

675
01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:28.129
Anthony Taylor: I think it makes, I think if you put it back in with dash, it makes the most

676
01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:35.830
Clayton Graves: that makes the most sense. But if if we were to to build up what we did, the decision to remove it. To begin with.

677
01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:38.709
Clayton Graves: we would have 50 and 4

678
01:06:39.110 --> 01:06:46.669
Clayton Graves: into our our list rather than 50 dash for. and then, when we remove the punctuation, it'll remove the dash.

679
01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:52.570
Baro, Sonja: So how do you handle that.

680
01:06:53.230 --> 01:06:56.299
Anthony Taylor: Anthony? Use, Kate?

681
01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:58.089
Baro, Sonja: Well, we my question

682
01:06:58.130 --> 01:07:09.510
Baro, Sonja: like, if you have only specific types of of combinations, a word where you need to keep that hyphen.

683
01:07:09.970 --> 01:07:15.919
Baro, Sonja: you would take it out of your out of your, you would add it to your rejects, so that you did not remove it

684
01:07:16.350 --> 01:07:21.110
Anthony Taylor: right. And I mean there are ways to do it. You can, you could.

685
01:07:21.310 --> 01:07:25.109
Anthony Taylor: And I'm I'm gonna you know what? Actually, I'll show you a better way to do this.

686
01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:30.960
Anthony Taylor: you could say, provide me a red X

687
01:07:31.330 --> 01:07:33.580
Anthony Taylor: to keep.

688
01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:36.229
Hyphenated

689
01:07:37.610 --> 01:07:44.810
Anthony Taylor: words! There are websites where you can like do this and test it. But I honestly, I use Redgex enough that I found

690
01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:46.830
Anthony Taylor: that this works freaking. Amazing.

691
01:07:47.850 --> 01:07:51.210
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And I mean, there it is. And then it explains.

692
01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:59.349
Anthony Taylor: okay, in great detail. like a lot of freaking detail.

693
01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:07.819
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, it. So this is a word boundary. then any word hyphen, any word word bound.

694
01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:13.379
Anthony Taylor: So basically that will identify a word with a hyphen and a motherboard.

695
01:08:14.110 --> 01:08:19.380
Anthony Taylor: and and so you could add that item. and then it wouldn't get rid of hyphenated works.

696
01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:28.100
Anthony Taylor: But if there was like a dash somewhere else, you can give it at that. Now, that may or may not be what you want. But this is a way you can find.

697
01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:29.450
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

698
01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:33.709
Anthony Taylor: that that there's like 3 or 4 things that I

699
01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:37.060
Anthony Taylor: door chat GPT. 4,

700
01:08:37.069 --> 01:08:40.840
Anthony Taylor: Reg. X. Is one of them. Json Schema.

701
01:08:41.029 --> 01:08:48.700
Anthony Taylor: getting the Json schema of something. Oh, my God, it's the greatest. You just put in a sample, Json, and say, Give it, Jimmy, and

702
01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:52.190
Anthony Taylor: be still, my heart.

703
01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:57.200
Anthony Taylor: because that's so much work it just is have to do. Am I right after study?

704
01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:01.680
Anthony Taylor: Are you there? Hefa! Is there?

705
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:06.929
Anthony Taylor: Do you ever have to do that? Get the schema of a Json?

706
01:09:08.279 --> 01:09:09.410
Gebrekristos, Haftom: No.

707
01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.629
Anthony Taylor: Oh, well.

708
01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:13.279
Anthony Taylor: trust me, it's hard.

709
01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:22.230
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's not. It's not hard. And and the the the assistance are like, done.

710
01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:24.790
Anthony Taylor: Okay. activity time.

711
01:09:24.819 --> 01:09:31.209
Anthony Taylor: Right? You're basically gonna do the same kind of stuff. Now, here's the interesting thing. You're gonna start building a function.

712
01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:34.010
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, if you look.

713
01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:44.039
Anthony Taylor: this first one is just clean text. So it's going to remove the stop words. We're going to remove the punctuation. You're going to tokenize after

714
01:09:44.319 --> 01:09:46.000
Anthony Taylor: you've cleaned your text.

715
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:51.039
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and then filter out words that are in stopwords lists. What's

716
01:09:51.370 --> 01:09:52.830
Anthony Taylor: move? Stop words

717
01:09:53.000 --> 01:10:02.960
Anthony Taylor: and then filter out more words. Okay, whatever  And then then you're gonna call that function, and there's another one.

718
01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:12.270
Anthony Taylor: Oh, and this one, you're just gonna do same thing. But you're gonna add some of your custom. Stop words. Okay? And then call the function. That's it.

719
01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:20.789
Anthony Taylor: which this is very cool. And this is how you would do it. You would create a function that does like 9% of this stuff.

720
01:10:21.690 --> 01:10:25.530
Anthony Taylor: And this is another 15 min job. Alright gang.

721
01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:28.750
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

722
01:10:32.610 --> 01:10:34.260
Anthony Taylor: I apologize. Now.

723
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:38.989
Anthony Taylor: my, my boxer sitting behind me chewing on something sounds

724
01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:40.869
Anthony Taylor: so if you hear it.

725
01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:45.180
Anthony Taylor: Sorry. Alright.

726
01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:50.750
Anthony Taylor: let's go

727
01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:59.730
Anthony Taylor: so, anyway. So this one we're bringing in waters. Ruters.

728
01:11:00.930 --> 01:11:08.200
Anthony Taylor: Reuters. we're going to bring in Reuters for Rodney alright Reuters and Reuters

729
01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:15.089
Anthony Taylor: stop words. We're gonna bring in tokenized. And our E read a brand download

730
01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:16.340
Anthony Taylor: berg.

731
01:11:17.370 --> 01:11:18.460
Anthony Taylor: We're looking good.

732
01:11:18.670 --> 01:11:25.849
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So first, we're going to give file ids for the categories of crude print out some crude articles.

733
01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:27.910
Anthony Taylor: A.

734
01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:33.510
Anthony Taylor: Oh, oh, they meant oil. Oh.

735
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:34.570
that's good.

736
01:11:37.170 --> 01:11:40.679
Clayton Graves: Okay, that's not the second article, though that's the third.

737
01:11:40.930 --> 01:11:44.799
Anthony Taylor: Is that the third article? Yeah, cause 0 1, 2,

738
01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:46.939
Anthony Taylor: right, Buddy.

739
01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:54.340
Anthony Taylor: Boo. even see, this one makes way more sense for oil.

740
01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:57.960
Anthony Taylor: I thought they were just talking about my humor.

741
01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.719
Anthony Taylor: that it was crude.

742
01:12:01.610 --> 01:12:06.519
Clayton Graves: We're not there. Let's just leave that alone.

743
01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:17.549
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we're gonna create the function. Now, this function, this is one of those really good functions that you guys could potentially use for other things

744
01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:20.019
Anthony Taylor: like even homework

745
01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:21.530
Anthony Taylor: or something.

746
01:12:22.050 --> 01:12:30.379
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So we have a cool little doc. This is good. By the way, I love that they put a docstring in here tells what we're gonna do.

747
01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:34.249
Anthony Taylor: We're going to grab the stop words from English.

748
01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:39.630
Anthony Taylor: We've already seen those. We don't really need to output those again. We're gonna create a

749
01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:42.879
Anthony Taylor: pretty much. Only letters and spaces.

750
01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:46.910
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to sub it in.

751
01:12:48.010 --> 01:12:52.200
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to word tokenize

752
01:12:52.710 --> 01:12:54.230
Anthony Taylor: all of our words.

753
01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:58.379
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to do a list comprehension

754
01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:03.949
Anthony Taylor: again, we're going to do for every word in our words, our token words.

755
01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:14.159
Anthony Taylor: if you know, lowercase it, and if it's not in our stop words. We're going to output the lowercase version of it to there

756
01:13:14.670 --> 01:13:16.229
Anthony Taylor: and then we're going to return it.

757
01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:25.149
Clayton Graves: I absolutely mauled this whole thing. So it was unrecognizable and unworkable. But does it make sense as I described it?

758
01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:34.749
Anthony Taylor: This does. Yes, okay, good. Alright. So because we did a return, you're gonna want to create a variable.

759
01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:42.540
Anthony Taylor: And you're gonna call your cool, new function, and you're gonna pass in your article. And then why are we doing set here?

760
01:13:48.490 --> 01:13:53.570
Derek Rikke: Get rid of duplicate words. Get rid of duplicates. Now I will tell you.

761
01:13:54.360 --> 01:14:05.290
Anthony Taylor: This is going to give us unique words. This isn't really what you always want in Nlp, but for what we're doing, we just wanted to see it. So we didn't get like a billion words.

762
01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:10.699
Anthony Taylor: Okay. but because we told it to become a set. It removed all the Duke

763
01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:14.020
Anthony Taylor: you could have just printed out

764
01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:16.110
Anthony Taylor: the whole thing if you really wanted to.

765
01:14:16.270 --> 01:14:21.329
Anthony Taylor: and I will tell you that word count becomes important before this day is over.

766
01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:23.670
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

767
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:25.670
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

768
01:14:26.250 --> 01:14:34.120
Anthony Taylor: here we're gonna do it again. But this time we're gonna add our own custom words. It's not a whole lot. What? Here's one thing I would change in this, though.

769
01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:39.930
Anthony Taylor: if if you wanted to do this for any article.

770
01:14:41.770 --> 01:14:44.650
Anthony Taylor: I would actually make this

771
01:14:44.770 --> 01:14:46.949
Anthony Taylor: an argument to the function

772
01:14:48.860 --> 01:15:01.669
Anthony Taylor: right? And then you would do it outside the function. Because then you could pass in any article with specific extra, you know, using my example before all those tweets with that virgin America in it.

773
01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:10.390
Anthony Taylor: or Virgin Atlantic, or whatever the heck. It was right you could pass in all those tweets as an article comma, and then say, add.

774
01:15:10.630 --> 01:15:26.389
Anthony Taylor: you know, or put in a set that includes that virgin planet, and then it would automatically remove it, and you wouldn't have to hard-coded in function any opportunity. So, guys, when you're writing functions, I know this goes way back. But I do this. I mean, I write.

775
01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:31.779
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. I write functions 3, 4, 5, 6 times a day, most days. Okay.

776
01:15:32.090 --> 01:15:40.330
Anthony Taylor: when you write a function, and as you get more senior. So you guys can start right now and be senior. Ish.

777
01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:42.650
Anthony Taylor: okay?

778
01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:54.259
Anthony Taylor: anything that is specific to one thing you want to see if you can take it out of the function, otherwise that function is only good for one thing.

779
01:15:55.020 --> 01:16:01.110
Anthony Taylor: Now, why do we write functions so we can reuse the logic on many things.

780
01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:02.330
Anthony Taylor: So

781
01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:05.809
Anthony Taylor: if if something like this is doesn't make sense

782
01:16:07.490 --> 01:16:16.990
Anthony Taylor: right, it just doesn't make sense. To put inside of this function would be much better to put it outside and make it an argument. And now you have something you can reuse.

783
01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:23.660
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but that's alright. It's still showing you how to do it. So let's run that.

784
01:16:24.010 --> 01:16:29.489
Anthony Taylor: and then let's run and see the result. Pretty much the same result, except we removed

785
01:16:29.790 --> 01:16:31.550
Anthony Taylor: these additional words

786
01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.109
Anthony Taylor: exciting questions.

787
01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:37.810
Anthony Taylor: nay.

788
01:16:39.950 --> 01:16:44.300
Anthony Taylor: alright! Break time. Come back 40 min after. Please

789
01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:47.940
Anthony Taylor: wait yeah, 40 min. right.

790
01:16:49.570 --> 01:16:50.680
Anthony Taylor: I'll see you there.

791
01:16:54.920 --> 01:17:00.930
Anthony Taylor: I'm all back. The golly! All were just sitting there behind your empty camera.

792
01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:05.589
Anthony Taylor: because it's like, but everybody appears

793
01:17:07.330 --> 01:17:11.869
Anthony Taylor: okay. We're gonna jump right back in and actually looking at it.

794
01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:15.280
Anthony Taylor: running a little by. So I'll pick it up a little bit

795
01:17:16.690 --> 01:17:21.090
Anthony Taylor: alright. So the next part of our Nlp processing

796
01:17:21.450 --> 01:17:22.950
Anthony Taylor: will be

797
01:17:22.990 --> 01:17:35.599
Anthony Taylor:  well, primarily focused on getting our root work. Okay? So there's 2 things that we do, we do stemming.

798
01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:44.360
Anthony Taylor: So this is going to get the root where the the the stem or the root form. So if you look at the example jumps, jumping, a jump will all be stemmed

799
01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:45.580
Anthony Taylor: to jump

800
01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:48.419
Masarirambi, Rodney: pretty easy. Supposed to be sharing the screen.

801
01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:50.610
Anthony Taylor: I'm sorry.

802
01:17:50.650 --> 01:17:52.300
Masarirambi, Rodney: Sharing screen

803
01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:57.729
Anthony Taylor: am I sharing? Am I not sharing it?

804
01:17:57.870 --> 01:18:04.450
Anthony Taylor: Will die. I was so excited because I thought I was. So I need to fix my sound, too.

805
01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:10.370
Anthony Taylor: There we go.

806
01:18:10.610 --> 01:18:15.559
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So so here you go, for example, jumps, jumping and jump. We'll all be spend

807
01:18:15.850 --> 01:18:18.560
Anthony Taylor: to jump. Okay.

808
01:18:18.710 --> 01:18:26.099
Anthony Taylor:  other examples. Boats voting voter. We're looking for that route

809
01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:37.340
Anthony Taylor: word. Now, I'm gonna show you another situation. Oh, well, here's some rules. Okay. So if you have a plural that's and like kisses

810
01:18:38.450 --> 01:18:40.170
Anthony Taylor: would become just kissed.

811
01:18:41.410 --> 01:18:43.520
Anthony Taylor: Movies.

812
01:18:43.570 --> 01:18:45.169
Anthony Taylor: No, that's not a good example.

813
01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:51.500
Anthony Taylor:  well, maybe because it's just that. And you're silent. So

814
01:18:53.650 --> 01:18:54.970
so just be, maybe.

815
01:18:55.410 --> 01:19:02.769
Anthony Taylor: And then ss, is still ss, and then a single S is just singular. So it doesn't worry about okay. So stemming.

816
01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:05.270
Anthony Taylor: it's one way we get to the root word.

817
01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:08.740
Anthony Taylor: The other one is lemmatization.

818
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:23.880
Anthony Taylor: Now. stemming is. it's really hard. And and they're examples of terror. Okay. reducing words to their base or root form, for example, base form of walking walked and walks walk

819
01:19:24.270 --> 01:19:27.500
Anthony Taylor: well, you could say the same thing about jumping jumps and jumped

820
01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:35.950
Anthony Taylor: right. What we're usually looking for in lemmatization is more like words that have

821
01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:38.180
Anthony Taylor: a different plural.

822
01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:40.719
Anthony Taylor: For instance, goose and geese.

823
01:19:42.330 --> 01:19:47.119
Anthony Taylor: Okay. for that to get the base word, the base word is still goose.

824
01:19:49.090 --> 01:19:57.719
Anthony Taylor: but because it's not it. Stemming isn't sophisticated enough to figure that out while lemmatization is, which, of course, means

825
01:19:57.770 --> 01:19:59.029
Anthony Taylor: that what

826
01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:06.820
Anthony Taylor: it's going to take more computational power. not the end of the world. Alright.

827
01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:10.180
So let's go see how this done.

828
01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:18.000
Anthony Taylor: The good news is is it's pretty similar to everything else we've done.

829
01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:28.029
Anthony Taylor: Oh, here's our stemming example. First. So for this, we're gonna use porter, Stemmer from the natural language toolkit.

830
01:20:28.420 --> 01:20:31.900
Anthony Taylor: Okay. we're going to create an instance of it.

831
01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:36.930
Anthony Taylor: Let's just create 11. A bunch of words in different tenses.

832
01:20:37.570 --> 01:20:42.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And what it should do is

833
01:20:42.930 --> 01:20:47.330
Anthony Taylor: output all of those words, their actual. Now.

834
01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:53.369
Anthony Taylor: this is actually really good. Right? It did drive. It. Did. Driver. Oh, wait.

835
01:20:53.790 --> 01:20:57.459
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Okay. Now, the snowball Stemmer.

836
01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:04.280
Anthony Taylor: did we not use? We didn't we? Yeah, just use that hold on one sec

837
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:11.380
Anthony Taylor: package and other fantasies. Following code shown. good

838
01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:17.360
Anthony Taylor: driving is a noun.

839
01:21:18.410 --> 01:21:26.830
Anthony Taylor: which is an interesting thing. But it could also be other things. So we're Gonna do the same process with Snowball Stemmer.

840
01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:38.279
Anthony Taylor: But it's more aggressive. Okay, so this is just another Stemmer. The difference between this one is, it can do other languages. Maybe you can do that one you mentioned, Brad.

841
01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:45.040
Anthony Taylor: So we can run this guy and run, it might see

842
01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:47.450
Anthony Taylor: some differences.

843
01:21:48.330 --> 01:21:53.509
Clayton Graves: I'm confused. Why didn't it reduce? Driven to drive as well? Because

844
01:21:54.360 --> 01:22:02.929
Anthony Taylor: that's a good question. And that could just be because, as a step, and the Stemmer itself may not be doing that. But the and we'll check that out.

845
01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:06.179
Anthony Taylor: See? Because this one didn't do it either.

846
01:22:07.090 --> 01:22:09.649
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And didn't I mean it

847
01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:17.490
Anthony Taylor: again? The idea behind one thing, one thing I do want to point out. Look at what it did was easily.

848
01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:24.089
Anthony Taylor: You guys see what it did with easily there.

849
01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:28.209
Anthony Taylor: it actually changed it

850
01:22:28.830 --> 01:22:32.250
Anthony Taylor: to like using a vowel instead of the Y

851
01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:38.820
Anthony Taylor: alright. Now, we all know that that's not the proper spelling, but fanatically the computer likes this better.

852
01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:40.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

853
01:22:40.630 --> 01:22:48.130
Anthony Taylor: so here's a sentence. The foxes walked into the boxes. We're going to tokenize it, and then do a Stemmer.

854
01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:49.880
Anthony Taylor: and what do we end up with?

855
01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:59.739
Anthony Taylor: The fox walked into the box. It got rid of Fox says, and Box says. Okay, now, before we get back to this, let's look at limitation.

856
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:07.569
Anthony Taylor: So this one word net lemmatizer. Bring in a couple of things here.

857
01:23:11.050 --> 01:23:13.030
Anthony Taylor: We're going to initialize.

858
01:23:14.130 --> 01:23:17.439
Anthony Taylor: and then we're going to do boxes and geese.

859
01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:23.380
Anthony Taylor: and you can see that it figures out that box, and you know we should put driven in there.

860
01:23:23.570 --> 01:23:25.610
Anthony Taylor: Let's see what driven if driven works.

861
01:23:28.090 --> 01:23:30.810
Anthony Taylor: Nope, driven still comes up that way. Darn it!

862
01:23:31.290 --> 01:23:36.969
Anthony Taylor:  We can also do past tense with limitives.

863
01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:40.649
Anthony Taylor: so we can do greater and boxed.

864
01:23:46.670 --> 01:23:48.969
Anthony Taylor: I'm not sure why that didn't go where it should have gone.

865
01:23:51.330 --> 01:23:52.960
Anthony Taylor: Going to reinitialize it.

866
01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:58.399
Anthony Taylor: I actually expect that to come up with fox and grate.

867
01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:01.620
Anthony Taylor: A

868
01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:08.920
Anthony Taylor: interesting

869
01:24:10.130 --> 01:24:11.180
Anthony Taylor: okay?

870
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:24.169
Anthony Taylor:  oh. interesting. Okay. So the past ends of a word indicates part of speech as a verb. and this one as an adjective

871
01:24:24.570 --> 01:24:27.860
Anthony Taylor: if we tell it, that's what it is.

872
01:24:28.470 --> 01:24:30.980
Anthony Taylor: I got it now. Okay.

873
01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:32.980
boxed itself

874
01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:34.570
Anthony Taylor: can be

875
01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:44.679
Anthony Taylor:  something else. Right? So this is the the lambetization of the past tense of the adjective of a word.

876
01:24:44.990 --> 01:24:46.589
Anthony Taylor: If we tell it.

877
01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.099
Anthony Taylor: we want the verb

878
01:24:49.150 --> 01:24:55.110
Anthony Taylor: lemmatize, it'll come up as fox, and in this case. Just the

879
01:24:55.330 --> 01:25:01.080
Anthony Taylor: adjective of a word indicates part of speech is an adjective. It comes up with rate.

880
01:25:01.650 --> 01:25:03.250
Clayton Graves: Okay.

881
01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:08.320
Anthony Taylor: I'm not sure why Great didn't come up here, but for sure we can force it.

882
01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:09.640
Clayton Graves: English.

883
01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:11.870
Anthony Taylor: English.

884
01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:18.450
Anthony Taylor: Yes, sir, hey, Anthony? Yes. So

885
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:24.409
Baro, Sonja: I guess where I'm struggling with this on on this particular example is.

886
01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:46.160
Baro, Sonja: are W. Do you have to do this and specify for every scenario whether it's a verb and additive and adverb all of that I mean, that that seems a lot ideally work it it absolutely. So you would do this when the result doesn't come up the way you expect

887
01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:51.929
Anthony Taylor: right? For the most part, you would probably your pro for the most part not. Probably

888
01:25:51.970 --> 01:25:58.049
Anthony Taylor: we would either. We would stem so in the past I just used stimming.

889
01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:03.319
Anthony Taylor: but you would use stemming and limit station or limitization, because limitation

890
01:26:03.330 --> 01:26:06.590
Anthony Taylor: does pretty much the same thing as stemming a little better.

891
01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:09.950
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And you would

892
01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:16.890
Anthony Taylor: if if you have a weird output. Then you would have to go get a little more specific.

893
01:26:18.130 --> 01:26:23.040
Anthony Taylor: Alright, but for the most part you're gonna be fine just using it as

894
01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:26.559
Anthony Taylor: alright. So using it with an actual sentence.

895
01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:34.359
Anthony Taylor: we're going to loop through it, levitize each one. The fox walked into the box. See again, you could argue. Well, is that right?

896
01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:41.709
Anthony Taylor: Okay. okay, might be it might not. I would try it. I would. Probably.

897
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:46.290
Anthony Taylor: Okay. because that's a tense.

898
01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:52.820
Anthony Taylor: I don't have a problem with that alright. alright!

899
01:26:56.890 --> 01:27:01.960
Anthony Taylor: I don't want us to run out of time, so we're going to do this next one as an everyone do real quick!

900
01:27:03.490 --> 01:27:06.580
Anthony Taylor: And then we will.

901
01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:10.780
Crap!

902
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:15.930
Anthony Taylor:  We'll do this next one as and everyone do, and then we'll get back into another lecture

903
01:27:16.710 --> 01:27:18.480
Anthony Taylor: just to keep moving.

904
01:27:20.410 --> 01:27:22.700
Anthony Taylor: Oh, goodness! 1 s!

905
01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:29.459
Anthony Taylor: Wanna make sure I got everything for you

906
01:27:30.630 --> 01:27:32.490
Anthony Taylor: that took forever.

907
01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:34.900
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

908
01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:41.480
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna bring in

909
01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:43.670
Anthony Taylor: moving it.

910
01:27:44.730 --> 01:27:50.300
Anthony Taylor: Don't be fun. We're net. Lemmatize the punch sentence toolbar. Okay?

911
01:27:51.890 --> 01:28:03.459
Anthony Taylor: So with. got all that good stuff. So here we're simply going to use our wordnet lemmatizer. So we're going to do. Lemmatizer

912
01:28:04.370 --> 01:28:08.550
Anthony Taylor: equals wordnet, lemmatizer, and it's an empty.

913
01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:10.180
Anthony Taylor: We'll instantiate it.

914
01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:15.069
Anthony Taylor: Then we're gonna do S. Stemmer. We're gonna have both of them in here

915
01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:30.280
Anthony Taylor: equals Snowball Stemmer. And inside of there we need to make sure we tell it, language equals English. Okay. so that will give us our initial stuff. Oh, look at this.

916
01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:31.769
Anthony Taylor: Well, that's handy.

917
01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:34.689
Anthony Taylor: So here we're gonna grab Melville's Mogadish.

918
01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:36.960
Anthony Taylor: We're going to

919
01:28:37.030 --> 01:28:45.000
Anthony Taylor: look for Chapter one of this book. and if it's there we're going to print it.

920
01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:49.910
Anthony Taylor: Look at that! The whole first chapter

921
01:28:50.430 --> 01:28:55.800
Anthony Taylor: call me Ishmael some years ago. Never mind.

922
01:28:58.390 --> 01:28:59.220
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

923
01:28:59.410 --> 01:29:03.319
Anthony Taylor: that would have hurt me reading that to my children, because that little bit hurt my throat.

924
01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:06.450
Anthony Taylor: All right, anyway. Yes, very.

925
01:29:06.790 --> 01:29:10.570
Mason, Natalie: When's your audio book coming out of that?

926
01:29:10.990 --> 01:29:15.099
I did not read it in that voice when I had to.

927
01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:20.009
Anthony Taylor: Would it have been that voice? I would think it would be that I think it should be, for sure.

928
01:29:20.590 --> 01:29:23.829
Anthony Taylor: But it's it's fiction. I don't read fiction. Mine would be

929
01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:27.460
Anthony Taylor: today. Regard those vegetation.

930
01:29:30.010 --> 01:29:35.700
Anthony Taylor: anyway. Okay, so here we're gonna write a little function

931
01:29:35.710 --> 01:29:38.210
Anthony Taylor: to do all of our fun

932
01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:39.530
Anthony Taylor: stuff!

933
01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:42.790
Anthony Taylor: Holy, Moly! That chapter is actually pretty long.

934
01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:47.049
Anthony Taylor: You know how you could tell right

935
01:29:48.590 --> 01:29:49.660
Anthony Taylor: click on that.

936
01:29:51.130 --> 01:29:54.009
Anthony Taylor: Look at that! That's long chapter.

937
01:29:56.190 --> 01:29:58.170
Anthony Taylor: Oh, wait! That's the whole flipping thing.

938
01:29:59.570 --> 01:30:04.310
Anthony Taylor: That's the whole book. By the way, if anybody's curious or wants it

939
01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:10.680
Anthony Taylor: cause I know I thought it was the coolest thing ever I do have the entire script

940
01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:15.370
Anthony Taylor: a Princess bride available for an lp, if

941
01:30:15.610 --> 01:30:16.410
you know.

942
01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:18.640
Clayton Graves: Inconceivable.

943
01:30:19.230 --> 01:30:21.689
Anthony Taylor: That is one of the stop words

944
01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:27.110
Anthony Taylor: that you should use when doing an lp, or that one.

945
01:30:27.570 --> 01:30:34.379
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So, Anthony, does that mean that the filter to match Chapter one didn't work?

946
01:30:36.490 --> 01:30:39.999
Anthony Taylor: It just gave us more than that, that's all.

947
01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:42.649
Anthony Taylor: It just it just gave us more.

948
01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:49.920
Dipinto, Matt: It is searching for chapter.

949
01:30:51.190 --> 01:30:52.240
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay.

950
01:30:54.650 --> 01:30:56.660
Anthony Taylor: what the heck is going on here. Hold on.

951
01:31:00.890 --> 01:31:03.940
Anthony Taylor: Oh, oh, hmm, okay.

952
01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:07.040
Anthony Taylor: there we go.

953
01:31:10.090 --> 01:31:23.830
Anthony Taylor: I think I went too far. Process text stemming. All right. Okay. So first thing we're gonna do is grab our stop port. So we're gonna do SW equals. And then again, we're going to do set

954
01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:26.090
Anthony Taylor: and

955
01:31:26.530 --> 01:31:31.890
Anthony Taylor: pass in our stop words dot words and tell it. We want English.

956
01:31:33.670 --> 01:31:36.610
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to do our Reg X.

957
01:31:37.540 --> 01:31:40.890
Anthony Taylor: Let's just create our pattern. We're gonna compile.

958
01:31:41.950 --> 01:31:50.210
Anthony Taylor: And there's the same pattern we've been using all day. It's gonna be square brackets. not

959
01:31:51.660 --> 01:31:56.000
Anthony Taylor: little a to little Z big a to big Z

960
01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:58.050
Anthony Taylor: space

961
01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:02.050
Anthony Taylor: and

962
01:32:04.110 --> 01:32:09.799
Anthony Taylor: very clean equals Regex dot sub. But

963
01:32:10.350 --> 01:32:13.320
Anthony Taylor: and we're going to take out.

964
01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:15.449
Anthony Taylor: press it with a space.

965
01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:18.529
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna use

966
01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:22.420
Anthony Taylor: the book that we're gonna pass it.

967
01:32:23.570 --> 01:32:24.390
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

968
01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:28.200
Next, we're gonna do words

969
01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:32.809
Anthony Taylor: equals. we're tokenize

970
01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:37.170
Anthony Taylor: re clean. So we're going to pass this into that.

971
01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:45.580
Anthony Taylor: Now we're going to stem our words. So we're gonna do, Ed. And then here we're gonna do

972
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:50.449
Anthony Taylor: for word in.

973
01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:57.760
Anthony Taylor: Oh, wait! Where am I? Forward? And words.

974
01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:02.460
Anthony Taylor: okay, so that's going to take it from those words.

975
01:33:02.630 --> 01:33:08.180
Anthony Taylor: And all we wanna do is stem each of those words. So we're gonna say, S

976
01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:12.420
Anthony Taylor: underscore stemmer dot stem

977
01:33:14.130 --> 01:33:15.350
Anthony Taylor: parentheses work.

978
01:33:17.220 --> 01:33:26.889
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Nope. alright. So let's make sure that's what we call our oh, I'm not going way up there hopefully. That's what I call it.

979
01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:33.820
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And then the last part of this, we're going to output the lower case of all the words that are left

980
01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:41.680
Anthony Taylor: that aren't in our stop words thing. So to do that. Remember, we're going to do list comprehension.

981
01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:45.680
Anthony Taylor: Our for loop is going to be for word in

982
01:33:46.210 --> 01:33:47.200
scam.

983
01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:50.630
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna filter. If we're

984
01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:52.360
Anthony Taylor: dot lower.

985
01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:56.269
Anthony Taylor: Not in

986
01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:57.920
Anthony Taylor: our stop words.

987
01:33:59.890 --> 01:34:02.580
Anthony Taylor: We want to get the lower version of that work.

988
01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:05.470
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

989
01:34:06.510 --> 01:34:08.160
Anthony Taylor: And then we'll return out.

990
01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:13.140
Anthony Taylor: There you go.

991
01:34:13.490 --> 01:34:18.309
Anthony Taylor: So there's our first function. So all we added to our old function. Is that

992
01:34:20.350 --> 01:34:21.570
Anthony Taylor: pretty much? Huh?

993
01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:26.709
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so here, let's print this out print set.

994
01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:29.700
Anthony Taylor: and we'll do process

995
01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:31.830
Anthony Taylor: text stemming

996
01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:34.760
Anthony Taylor: and pass in Moby Dick.

997
01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:41.839
Anthony Taylor: And there you go? Oh, gravy air drops

998
01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:49.650
Anthony Taylor: that sounded weird sounded like Ren and Stimpy or something.

999
01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:52.560
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So now we're gonna do the same thing

1000
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:55.470
Anthony Taylor: except

1001
01:34:56.070 --> 01:35:00.209
Anthony Taylor: and and and guys, I'm I'm just gonna grab this

1002
01:35:03.250 --> 01:35:06.090
Anthony Taylor: and replace to there

1003
01:35:08.050 --> 01:35:09.800
Anthony Taylor: a.

1004
01:35:09.950 --> 01:35:12.550
yeah. Yeah.

1005
01:35:13.090 --> 01:35:22.970
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So this way, all we have to do is come up with, there is a lot of words there, guys.

1006
01:35:23.370 --> 01:35:24.390
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1007
01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:27.630
Anthony Taylor: all we gotta do is the lamentation

1008
01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:32.230
Anthony Taylor: I want to say, Lemmings. what is that from?

1009
01:35:33.530 --> 01:35:40.630
michael mcpherson: I know it's from something that's an animal that likes to run off a live all together. Think Shakespeare

1010
01:35:40.740 --> 01:35:42.560
Clayton Graves: was also a video game.

1011
01:35:43.150 --> 01:35:45.210
Masarirambi, Rodney: I know it was a video game.

1012
01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:51.390
Masarirambi, Rodney: And nobody's actually seen the lemmings jumping off of a cliff. It's

1013
01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:52.880
Masarirambi, Rodney: she's not

1014
01:35:53.210 --> 01:36:02.960
Masarirambi, Rodney: mandala effect. Yeah, it's it's basically somebody like startup expression. And nobody's actually seen it actually happen, which is fun.

1015
01:36:04.980 --> 01:36:06.260
Anthony Taylor: You guys are killing me.

1016
01:36:07.170 --> 01:36:19.120
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So to use our lemmatizer that when we we set up at the beginning of all this we're just going to do. Len equals lemmatizer dot lemmatize word for every word in our words.

1017
01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:26.349
Anthony Taylor: Tokens. Okay? And then last, it's the same thing that we did before we're going to do output

1018
01:36:26.550 --> 01:36:32.460
Anthony Taylor: equals this comprehension pretty forward in Lamb this time.

1019
01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:36.340
Anthony Taylor: cause that's the one right above this.

1020
01:36:36.430 --> 01:36:42.730
Anthony Taylor: and if word lower. not

1021
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:52.940
Anthony Taylor: in SW. It's if that is true. then we want to take that work

1022
01:36:55.380 --> 01:36:58.450
Anthony Taylor: and then return output.

1023
01:37:00.110 --> 01:37:03.410
Anthony Taylor: And last, but not least. we're going to print it

1024
01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:17.439
Anthony Taylor: sadly. There's going to be so many words here. It's going to be

1025
01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:21.779
Anthony Taylor: very painful to try. Wait. Can we just do that?

1026
01:37:28.730 --> 01:37:31.360
Anthony Taylor: Oh, there's one for verbs. Too

1027
01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:35.050
Anthony Taylor: interesting

1028
01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:39.429
Baro, Sonja: nightmares

1029
01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:44.870
Baro, Sonja: cause it was not noun verb adjective or adverb

1030
01:37:45.940 --> 01:37:47.800
Baro, Sonja: you have to spell.

1031
01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:49.620
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

1032
01:37:49.650 --> 01:37:54.010
Anthony Taylor: okay, so you can kind of see right away. There's some, I mean. Look at these right here at the beginning.

1033
01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:59.640
Anthony Taylor: right? We can see there's some non root words there. So let's run that.

1034
01:38:02.650 --> 01:38:11.589
Anthony Taylor: and you can't see them as well now. So let's grab pretty much all of this.

1035
01:38:12.910 --> 01:38:17.100
Anthony Taylor: and we're gonna take it and make it a little bit different.

1036
01:38:17.590 --> 01:38:19.240
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay? So I'm gonna

1037
01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:22.010
Meredith McCanse (she/her): yes, something like this.

1038
01:38:22.090 --> 01:38:23.550
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Do you expect

1039
01:38:23.730 --> 01:38:25.170
Meredith McCanse (she/her): that like

1040
01:38:25.450 --> 01:38:31.449
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I do it on my computer with the exact same code that you have? I would expect the outcome would be the same

1041
01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:37.809
Meredith McCanse (she/her): right cause. The words are they might not be in the same order. Well, they should be more or less.

1042
01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:41.949
Anthony Taylor: I would think I don't know. I don't know if the

1043
01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:53.399
Anthony Taylor: totally in both of these functions, when we printed the set, I have different words than you do completely, but I would be interested if they're the same like as long as they're the same number of words. We're fine.

1044
01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:57.660
Anthony Taylor: alright. So if we do something like

1045
01:38:58.540 --> 01:38:59.480
Anthony Taylor: length.

1046
01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:06.659
Anthony Taylor: and then this. So we didn't save it to a variable.

1047
01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:15.160
Anthony Taylor: So type that.

1048
01:39:16.430 --> 01:39:20.080
Anthony Taylor: and see if you get 14,775.

1049
01:39:21.090 --> 01:39:23.829
Meredith McCanse (she/her): No, I have like 10,009.

1050
01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:27.350
Anthony Taylor: Well.

1051
01:39:27.650 --> 01:39:30.760
Anthony Taylor:  Try to think of where that would happen.

1052
01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:34.879
Anthony Taylor: And you did use the Moby, Dick one right.

1053
01:39:34.910 --> 01:39:42.580
Anthony Taylor: I don't want to scroll all the way back to top. But let's look at that. We could look at that. If you guys what you can check the book at a different section.

1054
01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:48.899
Raugewitz, Tania: Oh, well, no, no, no, because I, too, got 10,009.

1055
01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:51.289
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Well, maybe I have

1056
01:39:51.390 --> 01:39:57.370
Baro, Sonja: 14,000. 14,775.

1057
01:39:57.480 --> 01:39:58.670
Baro, Sonja: Yeah, same

1058
01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:00.380
Anthony Taylor: interesting.

1059
01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:10.740
Anthony Taylor: I I'm not too worried about that, because it's still as long as it's the right book, and it's outputting the words somewhere in there, there's probably something slightly different.

1060
01:40:10.790 --> 01:40:18.540
Anthony Taylor:  I'm more worried about the procedure right now. You're good.

1061
01:40:18.610 --> 01:40:27.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So only difference between the one up above and this one. Okay. is, we're going to add.

1062
01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:33.880
Anthony Taylor: Comma DOS equals. R,

1063
01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:38.380
Anthony Taylor: that's it. Okay?

1064
01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:41.169
Anthony Taylor: And that, you know.

1065
01:40:43.700 --> 01:40:49.040
Anthony Taylor: Tell it to also lemmatize the adverbs to their root words.

1066
01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:51.679
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we can run that.

1067
01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:59.389
Anthony Taylor: And then here it's pretty much the same one as up above here. It's branch set.

1068
01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:02.210
Anthony Taylor: What we call this one

1069
01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:05.220
Anthony Taylor: tax limitization.

1070
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:08.950
Anthony Taylor: No process. Did I run that cell?

1071
01:41:12.030 --> 01:41:15.820
Anthony Taylor: That's funny. They called it the same thing. Oh, well. okay.

1072
01:41:18.090 --> 01:41:22.029
Anthony Taylor:  right to see.

1073
01:41:25.770 --> 01:41:31.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then. Now there's all of the adverbs should also be done.

1074
01:41:31.770 --> 01:41:36.059
Anthony Taylor: So you don't have to identify all of them. You could just say, I want all adverbs also. Good.

1075
01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:39.619
Clayton Graves: II still don't understand.

1076
01:41:40.610 --> 01:41:52.330
Clayton Graves: Why. Why is it wailing and not real? Why is it confidentially, confidentially, and not confidential? Well, our privileges not privilege extract. It is not cracked.

1077
01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:58.680
Anthony Taylor: II I'm not gonna argue with you. There, not gonna lie. We. I have always

1078
01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:01.479
Anthony Taylor: take an issue with this, but it

1079
01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:08.510
Anthony Taylor: for the most part it does enough that we're okay with it. Okay,

1080
01:42:09.380 --> 01:42:16.240
Anthony Taylor: this is another thing. They've gotten better these days, that. But this, these models that were these toolkits that were using.

1081
01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:20.349
Anthony Taylor: it's doing, I mean, if we compare Trustee, it's different.

1082
01:42:20.570 --> 01:42:21.440
Anthony Taylor: But

1083
01:42:21.910 --> 01:42:31.359
Anthony Taylor: clearly there are some that don't make a lot of sense. And that's okay, too. Okay, as long as it's long as we go through the step, we know we've done

1084
01:42:31.450 --> 01:42:32.619
Anthony Taylor: what we can do.

1085
01:42:33.170 --> 01:42:34.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So

1086
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:36.119
Anthony Taylor: we're going to go with that

1087
01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:40.200
Anthony Taylor: alright grams.

1088
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:44.120
Anthony Taylor: So the Latin?

1089
01:42:44.610 --> 01:42:49.500
Anthony Taylor: Well, not really the last part. But now we're gonna start talking about frequency.

1090
01:42:49.620 --> 01:43:05.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So when we look at a document. So so we're doing natural language processing. And we have the book. Okay, and we want to put, we want to basically, what we're going to end up doing is assigning weights.

1091
01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:08.240
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Now

1092
01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:10.110
Anthony Taylor: in Moby Dick

1093
01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:15.420
Anthony Taylor: does the term fish

1094
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:18.150
Anthony Taylor: or whale

1095
01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:20.640
Anthony Taylor: hold a lot of

1096
01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:25.250
Anthony Taylor: carry a lot of weight in the book. The overall book, yes.

1097
01:43:25.450 --> 01:43:27.350
Anthony Taylor: but in a single

1098
01:43:27.470 --> 01:43:37.750
Anthony Taylor: paragraph or a single chapter it said so many times across so many paragraphs, that the weight of it's gonna draw

1099
01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:45.590
Anthony Taylor: right? Because it doesn't doesn't mean anything anymore. It gives me no, we. It's like, alright. I know it's about a fish move on.

1100
01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:56.149
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so and Nlp is going to actually lower that weight. So to do all of this, to determine all of this, it's actually going to count every single word.

1101
01:43:57.580 --> 01:44:02.730
Anthony Taylor: and then give us a count that the that the model will end up using

1102
01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:14.240
Anthony Taylor: so words and phrases to uncover patterns and themes within the text or corpus by prioritizing frequently occurring terms while excluding stop words. You'll have a good idea of what the document's about.

1103
01:44:14.580 --> 01:44:18.390
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we'll see fish or whatever fishing are high up there.

1104
01:44:18.570 --> 01:44:30.569
Anthony Taylor: But we're then going to go back like I said, we're going to go back and look okay. It's there a lot. So it must be important. But then we're going to go back and look at the whole corpus and go. Oh, but it's literally everywhere.

1105
01:44:31.170 --> 01:44:34.639
Anthony Taylor: So maybe it's not that important. It's literally an inverse relationship.

1106
01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:39.739
Anthony Taylor: An Ingram is basically a phrase.

1107
01:44:40.870 --> 01:44:48.150
Anthony Taylor: Now. here's the problem with that in Nlp in the original. In lp. it was just a number.

1108
01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:57.149
Anthony Taylor: so we can say 2 words, a diagram. but it would just pair up. 2 words didn't mean it didn't matter if they meant anything together.

1109
01:44:58.500 --> 01:44:59.640
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1110
01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:03.579
but it would pick. But every 2 words would come in

1111
01:45:03.660 --> 01:45:10.920
Anthony Taylor: a trigram. You know, all of these different things. Just try different things. And here you can be an example. Okay.

1112
01:45:11.380 --> 01:45:14.829
Anthony Taylor: it basically, instead of splitting on

1113
01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:21.649
Anthony Taylor: well, single words it would use like for a by grip. This is is a a sentence.

1114
01:45:24.010 --> 01:45:28.200
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And the trigrams, even this is they invite.

1115
01:45:30.630 --> 01:45:34.350
Anthony Taylor: Does that help, or does it hurt? I don't know. Okay.

1116
01:45:34.660 --> 01:45:43.200
Anthony Taylor:  so don't get this confused, because later, you guys are going to learn that whole attention thing where it looks at

1117
01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:46.000
Anthony Taylor: things in front of it and things behind it

1118
01:45:46.060 --> 01:45:52.059
Anthony Taylor: and comes up with a context. This is not context. This is simply

1119
01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:53.700
Anthony Taylor: location.

1120
01:45:53.890 --> 01:45:55.550
Anthony Taylor: It's it's

1121
01:45:56.660 --> 01:45:59.420
Anthony Taylor: it's it's geography.

1122
01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:02.590
Anthony Taylor: Right? It's just these are the words around me.

1123
01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:06.510
Anthony Taylor: but it has no idea if those words help it or permit.

1124
01:46:07.420 --> 01:46:10.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so let's learn how to do

1125
01:46:10.990 --> 01:46:12.110
Anthony Taylor: that.

1126
01:46:15.580 --> 01:46:25.380
Anthony Taylor:  okay. So for Ingram, we got a new util, a new tool

1127
01:46:25.620 --> 01:46:26.870
Anthony Taylor: in grams.

1128
01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:30.840
Anthony Taylor: Now, notice, we keep. Just add, okay.

1129
01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:36.380
Anthony Taylor:  the very last one is just going to do. Oh, no, this is, we're almost the last one. Good.

1130
01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:38.620
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So

1131
01:46:38.660 --> 01:46:47.609
Anthony Taylor: we got our Lametizer. We're going to return all the categories we're going to get. Cpi.

1132
01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:54.180
Anthony Taylor: There they go again with second right? Oh, no, they didn't say they said, get a random okay, that works

1133
01:46:54.490 --> 01:46:57.810
Anthony Taylor: Hungary raises prices and effort to curb deficit. Okay.

1134
01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:02.150
Anthony Taylor: alright. So now our process text function.

1135
01:47:03.010 --> 01:47:07.210
Anthony Taylor: we have our stop words. We have our redjacks to get rid of punctuation.

1136
01:47:07.370 --> 01:47:14.429
Anthony Taylor: We've got our token ice. Okay on the Red X, we're going to lametize the words

1137
01:47:15.090 --> 01:47:19.410
Anthony Taylor: and then we're going to output them. So this is the one you guys made.

1138
01:47:19.870 --> 01:47:27.320
Anthony Taylor: We made together. Okay, we're gonna run that yay and it fail. But I miss it. Process text.

1139
01:47:28.970 --> 01:47:30.450
Anthony Taylor: Did I not run something?

1140
01:47:31.620 --> 01:47:37.290
Anthony Taylor: Hey? Do you want to do that? 1, 2, 3 for 7.

1141
01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:39.790
Anthony Taylor: I think I didn't run it.

1142
01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:42.890
Anthony Taylor: 6.

1143
01:47:43.420 --> 01:47:45.430
Anthony Taylor: That's what it was. Okay.

1144
01:47:45.550 --> 01:47:51.080
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So now we're gonna add counts. So we got to import and a counter.

1145
01:47:52.360 --> 01:48:04.409
Anthony Taylor: and then we're going to say word counts counter and processed article. This is after we ran our cool little function on it. Alright. And then we're gonna print out a dictionary of the word count.

1146
01:48:07.310 --> 01:48:13.760
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So you see, every word, count, let's get the most. Let's get like the 10 of the most common.

1147
01:48:13.780 --> 01:48:15.010
Anthony Taylor: So said

1148
01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:21.269
Anthony Taylor: price deficit. Also effort consumer. Mti state percent 1 billion.

1149
01:48:22.490 --> 01:48:29.750
Anthony Taylor: That's the count, for each one of them said, is the most price being the second most. Okay?

1150
01:48:30.140 --> 01:48:35.959
Anthony Taylor:  So now, okay, and that's it. I mean, that's all there is to it for count words.

1151
01:48:36.930 --> 01:48:41.849
Anthony Taylor: It's not real complicated. But we're gonna need this information when we build out our model

1152
01:48:42.910 --> 01:48:43.750
Anthony Taylor: tomorrow.

1153
01:48:44.750 --> 01:48:56.040
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we can also do by grams and by grams, no big deal. Okay, we're simply going to say counter, then we're going to do in grams and tell it

1154
01:48:56.090 --> 01:48:59.750
Anthony Taylor: N equals 2 that makes it a vibrant

1155
01:48:59.970 --> 01:49:04.429
Anthony Taylor: alright. And all this is going to do is what I showed you before. It's going to put

1156
01:49:04.670 --> 01:49:08.599
Anthony Taylor: it's gonna take this word and this word down this word and this word down.

1157
01:49:09.110 --> 01:49:14.899
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And it does overlap. So like, if you have 4 words, it's going to be the first word and second word.

1158
01:49:15.110 --> 01:49:20.289
Anthony Taylor: The next one's gonna be the second word and third word. Well, I guess for vigrams. It's just

1159
01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:24.029
Anthony Taylor: okay. All right.

1160
01:49:24.340 --> 01:49:32.760
Anthony Taylor: and you can see the most common diagrams, effort curve, sharp price budget deficit state spending Mti set.

1161
01:49:34.370 --> 01:49:40.049
Anthony Taylor: I can say that might be helpful in some of these right? And that's it.

1162
01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:42.520
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so

1163
01:49:42.810 --> 01:49:52.019
Anthony Taylor: last, exercise the day 15 min. A, they basically just want you to add counter

1164
01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:56.940
Anthony Taylor: and diagram counter to that function which is right there.

1165
01:49:57.150 --> 01:49:58.340
Anthony Taylor: So copy

1166
01:49:59.450 --> 01:50:00.160
and below.

1167
01:50:00.630 --> 01:50:14.040
Anthony Taylor: Okay. is that what they want one more string. Oh, not exactly. Oh, no! They just want you to do the stuff I showed you at the end. Not come, not added to this. All right, you guys got it.

1168
01:50:14.330 --> 01:50:20.639
Anthony Taylor: I said it wrong. First time you're going to use this function. and then you're going to add that stuff. I just showed you

1169
01:50:20.990 --> 01:50:25.469
Anthony Taylor: to this one without the Ingram. And then this one with the Ingram

1170
01:50:26.770 --> 01:50:27.740
Anthony Taylor: got it.

1171
01:50:30.770 --> 01:50:31.480
Anthony Taylor: Thank you.

1172
01:50:35.990 --> 01:50:37.320
Welcome back.

1173
01:50:38.420 --> 01:50:40.450
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I have 1 min to get through. This

1174
01:50:41.650 --> 01:50:49.189
Anthony Taylor: might be a couple of minutes over alright. So what we have, we added in grams and calendar

1175
01:50:49.890 --> 01:51:00.609
Anthony Taylor: do our stuff. We're gonna initialize our. We're gonna use grain this time. How exciting is that?

1176
01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:07.029
Anthony Taylor: This is our same preprocessor from earlier should be good there.

1177
01:51:07.650 --> 01:51:09.389
Anthony Taylor: So for a word, count

1178
01:51:10.170 --> 01:51:12.789
Anthony Taylor: we're taking.

1179
01:51:13.130 --> 01:51:21.289
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna create a variable called big string. And basically put the entire corpus into that string, all of all of it.

1180
01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:22.420
Anthony Taylor: all of it.

1181
01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:27.599
Anthony Taylor: Then we're going to, or the corpus that was at in.

1182
01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:30.430
Anthony Taylor: So yeah.

1183
01:51:30.780 --> 01:51:34.899
Anthony Taylor: okay? And then we're going to process text. So that's using

1184
01:51:35.150 --> 01:51:40.880
Anthony Taylor: this guy. we're going to process it and return it to process.

1185
01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:51.289
Anthony Taylor: And then we're simply going to do a counter of the process get. So we're basically doing all those steps that we did in the instructor example in one line.

1186
01:51:52.270 --> 01:51:56.759
Anthony Taylor: So counter process, most common 10 dictionary.

1187
01:51:58.030 --> 01:52:06.690
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to return a data frame of the items in that dictionary. It's gonna be awesome.

1188
01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:10.519
Anthony Taylor: And that's what we get.

1189
01:52:12.940 --> 01:52:20.719
Anthony Taylor: That's a really cool thing. So again. this particular one actually is a good function because we could use this with anything.

1190
01:52:21.910 --> 01:52:22.950
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1191
01:52:23.090 --> 01:52:28.750
Anthony Taylor: now, II and then, for by Gram, it's same thing except you're going to run

1192
01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:35.619
Anthony Taylor: this. You're gonna initialize this by grams with N grams and then N equals 2

1193
01:52:36.500 --> 01:52:43.390
Anthony Taylor: on your process data and then do the same thing we did before we'll make it by Graham instead of words.

1194
01:52:44.410 --> 01:52:48.610
Anthony Taylor: And you get this. So

1195
01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:52.910
Anthony Taylor: I'll take questions on. This is a second. I was talking to you about

1196
01:52:52.930 --> 01:52:58.730
Anthony Taylor: the the whole document frequency thing. That is the first lesson tomorrow.

1197
01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:07.180
Anthony Taylor: So I jumped ahead. I like to do that. This one just counts doesn't assign weights, doesn't do anything. All this is doing is count.

1198
01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:12.830
Anthony Taylor: But that's important in the process to where we're leading towards.

1199
01:53:12.890 --> 01:53:23.269
Anthony Taylor: Hey? Ultimately, our model is, gonna take all of this information and use that to come up with whatever it is we tell it to predict.

1200
01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:27.840
Anthony Taylor: Alright. And it's not that tough to tell it to predict something. You'll see?

1201
01:53:28.140 --> 01:53:32.070
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's it's basically just a supervised mall.

1202
01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:38.580
Anthony Taylor: But it just has a lot of parameters yet. Fill it. Okay, in the preprocess.

1203
01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:47.400
Anthony Taylor: So how you guys like this so far, you know, it's it's kind of crazy only doing processing up.

1204
01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:53.990
Anthony Taylor: But it's kind of fun to take it all apart and see how it's all gonna look. So by the time we're done

1205
01:53:54.060 --> 01:54:06.330
Anthony Taylor: you'll be able to take these books in our you'll be able to do sentiment analysis pretty much any. and that if you can label it. it'll it'll it'll it'll learn it.

1206
01:54:07.470 --> 01:54:14.399
Clayton Graves: You underestimate the depth of my ability to just forget all of this.

1207
01:54:15.010 --> 01:54:18.429
Anthony Taylor: Well, don't forget it until at least

1208
01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:26.510
Clayton Graves: Tuesday of next week. Knowledge has been chasing me this entire time, but I am insanely fast.

1209
01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:31.070
Anthony Taylor: Well, that reminds me. on Thursday you guys have

1210
01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:40.080
Anthony Taylor: of next week, not tomorrow thumbs me out. You have a sub next Thursday

1211
01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:44.220
Anthony Taylor: because it's transformers. It's one of the areas I like

1212
01:54:45.660 --> 01:54:48.119
Anthony Taylor: I have to go out for Easter.
