1
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.840
Anthony Taylor: Resuming, sharing

2
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.300
Anthony Taylor: alright. So

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.470
Anthony Taylor: going to continue with the with the visualization stuff today.

4
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.160
Anthony Taylor:  we're gonna start with a quick, warm up. We're gonna do basically what you did yesterday.

5
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:34.400
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and then we're going to, because the reality is most of the time your data is not gonna come to you in a race.

6
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:42.460
Anthony Taylor: right? It's gonna be in a table and something that you're gonna pull in with pandas or some other data library.

7
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.630
As I mentioned yesterday. Panda's

8
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.579
Anthony Taylor: open source. Creators

9
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.040
Anthony Taylor: knew that map plot live was a huge part of python.

10
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.720
Anthony Taylor: So they

11
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.050
Anthony Taylor: added a lot of that capabilities into pandas.

12
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.030
Anthony Taylor: And

13
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.590
Anthony Taylor: yeah. And and as you will see today, a lot of it gets a whole lot easier

14
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.140
Anthony Taylor: when you're using

15
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:19.630
Anthony Taylor: pandas with map live. So today we're gonna use. We're gonna create plots using the data frame dot plot method

16
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:27.490
Anthony Taylor: data frame coming from pandas. We're gonna explain the disadvantages of using that over just plain old map, plot them?

17
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:35.230
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna analyze a complex data safe. So today, we're gonna do a lot of the stuff you guys did in pandas a couple of weeks ago.

18
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.890
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So be prepared to look back

19
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.229
Anthony Taylor: if you need to.

20
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.080
Anthony Taylor: And that's it literally. That's like the entire slide show for today. There's like one more slide.

21
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.539
The whole day.

22
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.980
Anthony Taylor:  so

23
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.580
Anthony Taylor: let's

24
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.510
Anthony Taylor: go here.

25
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.289
Anthony Taylor: Oh, wait. This is yesterday's huh?

26
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.090
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

27
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay. I will tell you guys.

28
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.570
Anthony Taylor: I'm a little bummed about some of today's activities.

29
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.960
Anthony Taylor: they're kinda some of them are kind of tough. so we'll probably convert some of these into everyone dues.

30
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.130
Anthony Taylor:  But

31
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.550
Anthony Taylor: I'll I'll let you guys know when we're gonna do that

32
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.879
and I have to say.

33
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.110
Anthony Taylor: Clayton.

34
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:48.970
Anthony Taylor: I have said this in my head like 6 times today while typing to me yesterday during office hours, it's high pit bull.

35
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.110
Anthony Taylor: How it

36
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.829
michael mcpherson: oops

37
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.019
michael mcpherson: I'm I'm not.

38
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:06.199
Anthony Taylor: anyway. So okay, so you guys gonna load in locations, create lists.

39
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:16.479
Anthony Taylor: set your limits, titles, labels. save it. Fairly simple for what you guys are doing yesterday. This is what you're going to do now 15Â min.

40
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.430
Anthony Taylor: Let me get you guys off to do that?

41
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.990
Anthony Taylor: No. I tried. Okay.

42
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.179
Anthony Taylor: So how do we do? Did we get? Did we get through it. Was it hard?

43
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.710
Anthony Taylor: Hurry you didn't get through it?

44
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.510
Mason, Natalie: I'm just having technical issues with with a Vs code.

45
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.220
Mason, Natalie: Natalie don't know.

46
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.589
Mason, Natalie: Are you getting the thing like I was getting where you have to. Yeah, you can. But it's probably what I was having yesterday.

47
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:50.850
Mason, Natalie: Let me see

48
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.990
Anthony Taylor: where you have to like. Restart the kernel like every other cell.

49
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.720
Baro, Sonja: Oh, we try. Well, I don't know if we've started it completely.

50
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.179
Baro, Sonja: Yeah. And we looked at it, the code and it looked right, but

51
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:14.350
Anthony Taylor: well, don't let me stop. You. Go ahead. You go ahead and then run alright. We can look at it after

52
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.459
Anthony Taylor: run eye, pit, bull and import your libraries.

53
00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:23.320
Anthony Taylor: Import your file.

54
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.419
Anthony Taylor: Was Watson. You guys waiting for someone to go

55
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.120
Dipinto, Matt: right there? What's that?

56
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.999
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So here we're gonna do an a range. We're gonna pass in the link of our

57
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.690
Anthony Taylor: data frame. This is not using. Yes, Matt, go for it.

58
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:47.589
Dipinto, Matt: I have a question about why we? No, II accept that. That's fine.

59
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:56.839
Dipinto, Matt: Why don't we just use a list of the state names as the X axis, rather than assigning a number and then

60
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.400
Dipinto, Matt: and then assigning the well, you're gonna learn how to do that because we haven't touched that yet.

61
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.350
Dipinto, Matt: Well.

62
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:11.440
Dipinto, Matt: I guess by accidentally, I've just been giving it the State, and I feel like I'm wrong, but it makes the plot display way better.

63
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.749
Dipinto, Matt: I agree. I completely agree. Okay, I'll shut up there.

64
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:23.370
Anthony Taylor: No, that was that was a good point. And and you're gonna see in just a few seconds we're gonna do it with pandas that way. But

65
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:32.570
Anthony Taylor: normally up until today we've been giving you guys just a raise. right? So you couldn't have done it.  Oh, and look at this

66
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:39.649
Anthony Taylor: this time you would have been wrong about tick locations. Because, look, they, they added, plus 0 point 4. So it's not just

67
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.779
Dipinto, Matt: so they shifted the entire thing right by point 4

68
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:54.439
Dipinto, Matt: instead of just. I have no comment, no complaints. I'm happy to be here.

69
00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.950
Anthony Taylor: I am not a reports Guy.

70
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.780
Anthony Taylor: Alright, when they come to me, and they say reports. I can tell them how the reporting engine works.

71
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:10.299
Anthony Taylor: I could tell them how to optimize it, but if they want me to make them something pretty. I go go talk to that person over there

72
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.099
Anthony Taylor: is. I don't do pretty.

73
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.400
Anthony Taylor: Okay. I mean this, okay. But

74
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.229
Anthony Taylor: reports forget about

75
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.259
Anthony Taylor: okay. I don't do pretty.

76
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:28.110
Anthony Taylor: So I don't know. Maybe that's pretty to somebody I don't know, anyway. So this is a new thing. Thought that figure.

77
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:33.020
Anthony Taylor: All this is doing is basically saying that the canvas you're gonna put the plot on.

78
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.789
Anthony Taylor: It's going to be 20 by 4. That's it.

79
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:44.209
Anthony Taylor: So plopped up bar, we have our X-axis notice, they're using the data frame column. Did we do that yesterday?

80
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:45.920
Anthony Taylor: We didn't. Right?

81
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.139
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So they are using the column from the data frame as the

82
00:06:51.160 --> 00:07:07.140
Anthony Taylor: the values. They got a color and alpha, and they're aligning to the edge, which is probably why they're doing this point 4 to do it. The X ticks. They're using tick locations. And then they're using the state column.

83
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

84
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.999
Anthony Taylor: so this is how they're getting the state values. And look at this.

85
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.790
Anthony Taylor: This is, I know this is all stuff that that

86
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:23.600
Anthony Taylor: did they tell you to do this? This is again. This is additional. You could have done this the way you did it yesterday. It would've been fine.

87
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.020
Anthony Taylor: This is some extra cool stuff that you can also do.

88
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.269
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we're gonna rotate them vertically.

89
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.160
Anthony Taylor: And it looks like that.

90
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:41.750
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But we got a problem right away. Right? Everybody see the problem. Yeah. it's like going off the screen.

91
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:51.789
Anthony Taylor: That's not okay. So how can we fix that? Well, this is gonna go to wile. But at the moment, let's do X. Lynn.

92
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:56.690
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to bring this over all the way over. And then we're gonna say.

93
00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:03.019
Anthony Taylor: negative, 2.2 5, and then the length of our X axis.

94
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:07.649
Anthony Taylor: So that's how many value. Okay, that's what that's going to do.

95
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:17.269
Anthony Taylor: Y lamb is going to start at 0 and go up to the Max value of the range df inches column and then add 10,

96
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:20.630
Anthony Taylor: and then we'll take a look at what that looks like. Okay.

97
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:25.050
Anthony Taylor: little different. Right? It's you can see it squeezing it in a little bit.

98
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:37.029
Anthony Taylor:  okay. So we're title X label, Y label, so much to say about that. Those things being added so you can see it. But you still can't see that doggone y label.

99
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.579
Anthony Taylor: So here's how you fix it.

100
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.189
Anthony Taylor: I want to actually put a split here.

101
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.230
maybe.

102
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.349
Anthony Taylor: Oh, that wasn't it.

103
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:51.820
Wow!

104
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.539
Anthony Taylor: I hate when I can't get that to work. Okay.

105
00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.750
Anthony Taylor: So by doing plot plot type layout.

106
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:12.889
Anthony Taylor: it basically tries to center everything that it can. Now, this one is way larger than the screen. There's nothing we could do about it. Okay, but

107
00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.190
Anthony Taylor: might.

108
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:18.700
Anthony Taylor: Now you can't let me do my Whoa! Let's check it.

109
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:24.530
Anthony Taylor:  I will show you how we're gonna fix this or make this look pretty or late.

110
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.489
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, and then, if we want to say that we do that. Yes, Mary.

111
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.860
Meredith McCanse (she/her): is there a way to

112
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:39.940
Meredith McCanse (she/her): flip it so like right now, Alaska, the first letter, the word is at the bottom. Is there a way to flip it? So the first letter, the word Alaska, is at the top.

113
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.380
Anthony Taylor: I love that question, and I'm going to tell you. The answer is, probably

114
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:56.160
Anthony Taylor: I don't know it off the top of my, okay, yeah, yeah, I would say almost definitely, cause almost everything in map is configurable.

115
00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:00.109
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I don't know. Off top of my head with that art. With that command.

116
00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.570
Dipinto, Matt: X, 6, rotation equals 2 70.

117
00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:08.469
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Nice Matt, master of Google, I tell you.

118
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.550
Anthony Taylor: or did you just know that one? Because it was so obvious?

119
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.870
Dipinto, Matt: I googled it while we were in the thing?

120
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:25.959
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So instead of vertical, you just put the numbers 270. Yep. So 90 would be the same as vertical, and 270 is vertical backwards. But here we go? Let's just do it just because Matt told

121
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.929
Gardner, Curry: you could also negative.

122
00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:38.239
Anthony Taylor: Did you do it as a string merit?

123
00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:50.039
Sihong Zhou: I think you should put it as number. There we go. Yay, see, that's easier awesome. I find that easier to read.

124
00:10:50.510 --> 00:11:09.060
Anthony Taylor: But you could have also done something like definitely better reducing it makes it backwards slow.

125
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:15.610
Anthony Taylor: Oh, that's 300. Can you guys see my screen?

126
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:22.689
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Good. Cause. I'm like, I'm like typing when you guys are saying that. And I'm like, what are you talking about? I put numbers there.

127
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:37.459
Anthony Taylor: Michigan.

128
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:42.160
Masarirambi, Rodney: The the point of this story is

129
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:45.900
Anthony Taylor: when you have a situation like that. You see that looks way. Better right.

130
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:48.830
Anthony Taylor: Don't you guys think?

131
00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:55.339
Anthony Taylor: Slightly tilted. going left to right instead of right to left.

132
00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:00.100
Clayton Graves: I run into the issue. I have trouble matching up the

133
00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:09.710
Clayton Graves: when it's slanted like that. Once you get sort sort of towards the end or in the middle there it gets hard to tell which bars, for which state

134
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:17.639
Anthony Taylor: that's true. But yeah, you're right, and that that might have to do with particular locations thing that we did.

135
00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.120
Anthony Taylor: But anyway, here's the the whole thing. If you wanted to see the whole thing.

136
00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:25.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

137
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:32.490
Meredith McCanse (she/her): what did you do? That made it pop up a little higher, so that the whole word, the whole state word showed I missed that.

138
00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:34.300
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Hmm.

139
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.580
Anthony Taylor: plot tight layout.

140
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.190
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yeah. Men didn't do it. But that's okay.

141
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.440
Anthony Taylor: Well.

142
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:45.890
Anthony Taylor: you sure

143
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:52.799
Meredith McCanse (she/her): yeah, I think so. PLT. Dot tight underscore lay. Oh, I didn't have the parentheses afterwards. Maybe that's it.

144
00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:53.950
Anthony Taylor: There you go!

145
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.429
Meredith McCanse (she/her): There we go. Yep. Thank you.

146
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:58.230
Anthony Taylor: Alright awesome.

147
00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:04.840
Anthony Taylor: alright. Any other questions about this exercise. This was a cool exercise, and we kind of started to introduce pandas.

148
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:07.889
Anthony Taylor: But that isn't the how we're gonna do. That's Panda's

149
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:14.120
Anthony Taylor: with map plotlid as in, we're gonna treat them as separate things.

150
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:27.829
Anthony Taylor: Now. we're going to treat them as the same thing. Actually, what we're gonna do is first do the same thing. But in map lib. so we're going to create this average rain for state.

151
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.529
Anthony Taylor: same one as before. Actually, we're gonna do

152
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:33.390
Anthony Taylor: a similar thing.

153
00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:40.080
Anthony Taylor:  so here's all of those things we just looked at a second ago.

154
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:47.320
Anthony Taylor: and I don't know why they're doing a picture. And and this doesn't make any sense, either. Let's let's have multiple, but shows why?

155
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:53.599
Anthony Taylor: So they did figure they did the bar. They did X ticks.

156
00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:59.540
Anthony Taylor: Excellent Y lim. Titles, labels, tight layout save fig. One cell. That's all you need.

157
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:08.399
Anthony Taylor: Okay. boo. alright. So that's doing it with map that. Now let's do it with pins.

158
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.230
Anthony Taylor: So same data frame.

159
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:16.890
Anthony Taylor: But I'm going to select out just state and inches. Notice.

160
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:21.460
Anthony Taylor: that is what we're using up here. State and inches.

161
00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:28.260
Anthony Taylor: So I'm going to select out using our double bracket notation state and inches.

162
00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:32.970
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to set the index to state

163
00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:39.109
Anthony Taylor: why is that important? Because the index will become our tics, our ladies?

164
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:47.860
Anthony Taylor: In this case. Yeah, it doesn't always have to work that way. It does in this case. So then we end up with something like this.

165
00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:56.790
Anthony Taylor: Now we can say state in inches. Dot plot spelled out now like before.

166
00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:02.419
Anthony Taylor: Kind equals bar. Give it a figure size. You don't even have to do that.

167
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.519
Anthony Taylor: You can give it a title and then show it and type it up. And there you go.

168
00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:11.150
Anthony Taylor: So we went from all of this

169
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.020
Anthony Taylor: to basically that.

170
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay, basic.

171
00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:26.840
Anthony Taylor: So notice it automatically. Put this label here. We didn't have to add that label.

172
00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:36.860
Anthony Taylor: okay, use the column header as the label. It used the column header for the other one as the as the legend.

173
00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:45.119
Clayton Graves: Alright, all that's just built it. Huh! Anybody want to do it the other way. Then, because this seems a lot simpler.

174
00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:55.669
Baro, Sonja: as they show us the hard way.

175
00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:57.710
Mason, Natalie: I love that

176
00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:07.849
Anthony Taylor: 100%, we're gonna well, okay. pandas does an implementation of map plotlid. But you remember all those really crazy charts I showed you yesterday

177
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:11.680
Anthony Taylor: in the gallery. You can't do those with just pans.

178
00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:16.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so the basic charts bar line scatter.

179
00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:22.180
Anthony Taylor: You know, Pi, we could do with pants. Alright, but like the really crazy ones, not so much.

180
00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:27.079
Anthony Taylor: You can still use pandas as your data source. But you would need to use map.

181
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:33.189
Anthony Taylor: So here we go again the next one this time. Now, this is my favorite part of Panda's plot.

182
00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:39.090
Anthony Taylor: So this one, we specifically gave it just the 2 columns. But what if you gave it no columns at all.

183
00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.429
Anthony Taylor: Let's see.

184
00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:53.620
Anthony Taylor: it basically just gave us a bar for every numerric column in the data frame.

185
00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:58.079
Anthony Taylor: There were only 2, but it gave us a bar for each other.

186
00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:06.680
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So we have a multi bar bar bar chart, and it did all of that. It even did this slanting way that Meredith likes it

187
00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:11.360
Anthony Taylor: without me telling it to do. Well. kind of

188
00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.119
Anthony Taylor: okay, actually, I wonder?

189
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.280
Anthony Taylor: Oh, so

190
00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.709
Anthony Taylor: let's let's try something here, let's cross that out.

191
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:22.650
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

192
00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:32.019
Anthony Taylor: I was thinking it should have used the state value. But I guess you can't. It doesn't know which value to use right there, because there's more than one, so you can tell it specifically which one?

193
00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.410
Anthony Taylor: Okay. pretty cool, huh?

194
00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.130
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So

195
00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:47.269
Anthony Taylor: this next exercise. Let me look at it because I'm pretty sure I'm right about this one.

196
00:17:56.050 --> 00:18:04.429
Anthony Taylor: Oh, maybe this isn't it? Let me just look. there's one of these that there's just no way I'm gonna put you guys in a room. Try to figure it out.

197
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:10.630
Anthony Taylor: Not that you could. I mean I have all the confidence in the world that you could, but it will take longer than you have.

198
00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:13.680
Anthony Taylor: so let me just verify this one real quick.

199
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.290
Anthony Taylor: I did not right tell which one

200
00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:28.290
Anthony Taylor:  well, let you know what let me give you. I you know what I think you could do it because there's only one thing weird about this.

201
00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:35.569
Anthony Taylor: So let's just talk about how you're gonna do it. Well, everyone knows how to read in a Csv with pandas. No problem

202
00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.140
list columns. We all know how to do that.

203
00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:40.940
Anthony Taylor: So this is the weird one.

204
00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:46.329
Anthony Taylor: So forget plotting for a second. How do you get

205
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.960
Anthony Taylor: the total settlements by a column? So

206
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:56.220
Anthony Taylor: to make that a little simpler, spoke. I made that up.

207
00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:03.369
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I want the value. And how many instances of that value exist?

208
00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.409
Anthony Taylor: What command is that.

209
00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:15.310
Baro, Sonja: Sonia? I saw that? Yeah, it's either. I wasn't sure. If it was count or some, but it's one of the

210
00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:17.769
Anthony Taylor: that's close. Brando. What do you think?

211
00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:20.899
Well, there's some

212
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:27.369
Mckimmy, Brandon: I mean you could do. I don't know. Value accounts would work. It is okay.

213
00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:33.870
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So what you would want to do here is, do value counts because value counts will give you a series

214
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:42.400
Anthony Taylor: with a key which would be the value and account, which would be, how many of that value exists? Once you have that

215
00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.290
Anthony Taylor: you have what you need for your bar chart.

216
00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:54.309
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So I didn't find that when I looked at some like they might not realize. That's what this is asking for.

217
00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:56.159
Anthony Taylor: But that's what this is asking.

218
00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:03.339
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so once you have the value counts, you pretty much have everything you need

219
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:06.639
Anthony Taylor: to create.

220
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:14.350
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to give you guys one more thing. So I want you to look up.

221
00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:23.570
Anthony Taylor: I want everybody real quick. Just do data, frame

222
00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:26.349
Anthony Taylor: dot plot and look that up.

223
00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:38.290
Anthony Taylor: So go to pated pandas data frame dot plot. And I want you to see all of the things you can do when you make this call. Okay.

224
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:41.060
Anthony Taylor: data series or data frame

225
00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:46.610
Anthony Taylor: we already talked about. Value counts is a series. So we're good there. X and Y,

226
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:51.570
Anthony Taylor: you can leave it as nothing because you've already passed in the data.

227
00:20:52.270 --> 00:21:03.210
Anthony Taylor: Alright, if you pass in the the the data, and it only has a key and a column. a column of numbers. That's your X and y. You don't have to do that.

228
00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:16.510
Anthony Taylor: Notice. Default none, default, none kind. Here's all the different kinds you can do with and plot you're doing a bar. This is easy. Okay, you can fiddle with the axes a bit.

229
00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:21.140
Anthony Taylor: Subplots we may or may not talk about in this class.

230
00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.680
Anthony Taylor: Don't worry about most of these.

231
00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:29.310
Anthony Taylor: But do notice that look, I can do fake size in here.

232
00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:33.490
Anthony Taylor: I can do title in here.

233
00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.910
Anthony Taylor: I can do x limb and y lim in here.

234
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:51.099
Anthony Taylor: So in all, in one call. you can technically do everything we were doing in map plot lib in one function. Call

235
00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:54.599
Anthony Taylor: okay with, I will tell you.

236
00:21:54.650 --> 00:22:08.590
Anthony Taylor: You might have to set your ex-tick labels to the index of the value counts that you did alright, but you know, in fact. I will give you guys

237
00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:14.040
Anthony Taylor: this line. I'll show you where it goes. First.

238
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:26.660
Anthony Taylor: It'll go right there. Okay, but there is a step to get exit labels out of value counts. See if you guys can figure that one out alright.

239
00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:31.060
Anthony Taylor: Alright. I'm also gonna put that into live slack

240
00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:36.550
Anthony Taylor: so that everybody has it case you lose it when I close my screen.

241
00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:39.380
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

242
00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.259
Anthony Taylor: you guys ready to go do this?

243
00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:45.510
Anthony Taylor: Pretty? Okay?

244
00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:50.690
Mckimmy, Brandon: Yeah. It wasn't show to put for the y axis.

245
00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:55.460
Anthony Taylor: you didn't need to put anything that was the beauty of it.

246
00:22:57.290 --> 00:23:01.790
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So let's take a look. Oh.

247
00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:12.719
Anthony Taylor: so we get our basic stuff installed. We're going to create our data frame. We're going to take a quick peek at the columns. Quite a few of them.

248
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:21.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're gonna do the value counts like we talked about and assign it to a variable which let's just look at that variable.

249
00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:26.130
Anthony Taylor: and we can see we have a key.

250
00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:29.849
Anthony Taylor: We'll actually have a column, a key and a value.

251
00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:34.089
Anthony Taylor: This is your X. This is your Y brando

252
00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:37.240
Anthony Taylor: XY.

253
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:49.119
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So we're going to use that to do dot plot. we're going to say, make us a bar face color, red fig size. I don't care if you did. Fig size or not. Title X label Y lab.

254
00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:59.950
Anthony Taylor: This is why I showed you guys all of that so that you could do that if you didn't do it in the single one. That's not a problem. Alright. It's just we're just showing you that you can't.

255
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.820
Anthony Taylor: Once you add that

256
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:04.630
Anthony Taylor: I gave you this line.

257
00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:10.549
Anthony Taylor: Okay, what you needed to do is grab the index. So you wanted these column names

258
00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:23.809
Anthony Taylor: assigned to the ecstic labels wasn't a simple thing, but you know it's a challenge supposed to be a little bit complicated. Alright, so we'll run that bring you in up with this.

259
00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:31.850
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so the key here and III mentioned this when I was showing you the documentation.

260
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:37.000
Anthony Taylor: When you're doing Panda, stop plot, you typically don't have to tell it X and Y,

261
00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:46.609
Anthony Taylor: if you formatted it properly. In this case, we formatted it, using value counts. So we didn't have to give it an X and Y, there is an X and y.

262
00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:50.359
Anthony Taylor: okay, and then we can tighten it up.

263
00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.850
Anthony Taylor: and it's a beautiful thing. That's it.

264
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:57.680
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I have a question.

265
00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:58.850
Anthony Taylor: Yes.

266
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.490
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Is it necessary in the class exercise? We did right before this we sort of did a step before.

267
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:10.339
Meredith McCanse (she/her): This step of the configuring where we like assigned an index

268
00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:19.360
Meredith McCanse (she/her): and for the state and inches. Did we not need to ass? Do you not need to assign an index?

269
00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:24.620
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, that was you still could. Oh, was that one I did for you?

270
00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:29.199
Meredith McCanse (she/her): That was under the using pandas to chart a data frame. That's what we're doing right?

271
00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:46.929
Anthony Taylor: Right? Are you talking about the first activity? You guys did? Nope, just the the activity. We did right before the breakout room. So the group one where you were showing series

272
00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:51.779
Anthony Taylor: right? So we set this as an index so that that would.

273
00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:59.419
Anthony Taylor: It does 2 things, one, when you pass it into data, frame dot plot, it will use that as your call as your tick.

274
00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.720
Anthony Taylor: Okay, as your label, and 2,

275
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.960
Anthony Taylor: perhaps later, we want to filter

276
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:15.069
Anthony Taylor: on state rather than having to say state equals. If you do this, you could just put, you know Arizona, Arkansas, Alaska.

277
00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:19.990
Anthony Taylor: and it'll only show those you don't have to like. Do it equals 0 in, or anything like that.

278
00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.150
Anthony Taylor: Does that

279
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:24.160
Anthony Taylor: answer what you're saying, Mary, what you're asking?

280
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:39.080
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I think so. I think you're saying that because of the structure of that data, it wasn't like it needed an index versus the value counts was already indexed. Or maybe the index is irrelevant. Well, actually, here, here let me say it different.

281
00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:42.570
Anthony Taylor: So because we filtered it like this.

282
00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:45.750
Anthony Taylor: This is a data frame with 2 columns.

283
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:50.649
Anthony Taylor:  Okay, in the example we just did.

284
00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:52.610
Anthony Taylor: This

285
00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:58.899
Anthony Taylor: is a series, not a data frame with 2 columns. It's a series. There's an index

286
00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:00.670
Anthony Taylor: and the value.

287
00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:11.689
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So so we got to pass this in. And it was really self explanatory for the system to deal with it. But the the other one we needed we wanted to.

288
00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:15.950
Anthony Taylor: I'm not even positive. I wanna say, you don't actually

289
00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:23.609
Anthony Taylor: have to set the sent. It sent the index. But if you don't, you might have to set the X to click.

290
00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:28.880
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that would be the only concern I would have.

291
00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:33.929
Dipinto, Matt: We didn't set the index, or we actually reset the do the States

292
00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:59.879
Dipinto, Matt: for the for the Union one we we went without an index. Yep, yeah. You don't have to set the index in this one. You're just this right here is not setting it. It's simply meeting. Yep. Brought to that. We we reset the index, so that we could call the column. That was the index to put it into the X labels. It was a very long way of doing the simple thing. That's that's alright, though. That's what you're learning.

293
00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:04.010
Anthony Taylor: Okay. anyway, that's good. Okay.

294
00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:11.969
Anthony Taylor: keep moving. I think we can keep moving. Make sure we're not supposed to go on break. Nope.

295
00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:14.160
Anthony Taylor: okay, so

296
00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:23.789
Anthony Taylor: that was just data. I mean, well, technically, we aggregated data right here, cause we got it, we said group by and give me the count.

297
00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:25.360
Anthony Taylor: But

298
00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:30.360
Anthony Taylor: that's not always as simple as that. So what we're gonna look at now

299
00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:32.200
Anthony Taylor: is

300
00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:38.479
Anthony Taylor: doing a group buy and doing some other like we do aggregations. We can do averages. We can do all kinds of stuff.

301
00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:42.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so here we're pulling in this accident data.

302
00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:52.390
Anthony Taylor: And we're going to create a group by on this column. this stores, the type of road accident that occurred

303
00:28:53.140 --> 00:29:06.080
Anthony Taylor: all right. So we're gonna group by functions name. And then we're going to do accounts. So, could we have done this with value counts? Yes, absolutely. We could. Okay, because it's just this one, an account.

304
00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:11.569
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But we could do an average. We could do, Max. We could do all kinds of stuff

305
00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.900
Anthony Taylor: right? The main reason we're doing count right here.

306
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:21.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Because if we did a mean, or a Max or Min, how many columns, how many bars would we have

307
00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:28.810
Anthony Taylor: one? Well, that wouldn't be very interesting visualization. That would.

308
00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.859
Anthony Taylor: So by doing this, we get lots of ours.

309
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:40.770
Anthony Taylor:  here, we're going to notice there's no X. There's no y. We didn't do any of the config inside of here. Could we do these inside of there?

310
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:42.370
Anthony Taylor: Yes, we could.

311
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:48.620
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but it's this is totally showing you. You don't have to same way every time.

312
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:56.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay. run that, and we end up with the folks. This name and

313
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.050
Anthony Taylor: the labels all in place.

314
00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:00.640
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

315
00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:06.259
Anthony Taylor: principal arterial was the number one.

316
00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:14.370
Anthony Taylor: So I mean, that's a really quick demo.

317
00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:16.189
Anthony Taylor: But the bottom line is

318
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:19.770
Anthony Taylor: we did a group I of any column.

319
00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:25.379
Anthony Taylor: In this case we just did account, but you could do a lot of different things here.

320
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:29.130
Anthony Taylor: Okay, once you have a series.

321
00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.629
Anthony Taylor: you have everything you need to do a bar chart.

322
00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:34.760
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

323
00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:43.630
Anthony Taylor:  don't move just a second. Let me take a look. If this is the one that had the crazy stuff in.

324
00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:50.790
Anthony Taylor: There is one today that just has like too much new stuff. So I'm trying to

325
00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:55.379
Anthony Taylor: keep us on the same page for that one.

326
00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:04.870
Anthony Taylor: Okay, yeah.

327
00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:14.709
Anthony Taylor: yeah. I think this is a good one to do together. So this next one we'll do together. But I want you guys to do it with me. Don't just watch me do it, please.

328
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:17.490
Anthony Taylor: Much more interesting when we do them

329
00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:22.220
Anthony Taylor: together. Alright.

330
00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:28.620
Anthony Taylor:  So

331
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:41.560
Anthony Taylor: for this assignment, you're going to be taking library usage data from San Francisco and creating charts to determine which patron type checks out items from the library. The most

332
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:50.240
Anthony Taylor: import. Your dependencies reduce the data to only include page groups who have checked out at least one item.

333
00:31:50.780 --> 00:32:02.210
Anthony Taylor: Split your data into groups based on Patreon type. Charge your data, using a bar graph, giving it both the title and label for the acts. Alright. Here's our imports. Those haven't changed.

334
00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:06.799
Anthony Taylor: Here's our data. Let's take. Let's download it and take a quick look.

335
00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:14.790
Anthony Taylor: So it said. reduce the data to only patrons who have checked out at least one item. So

336
00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:18.290
Anthony Taylor: probably gonna want this followed. Yeah.

337
00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:26.749
Anthony Taylor: I would say, we're gonna say, we only want data with more than one total checkouts.

338
00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:36.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay. the other thing it says. split your data into groups. So we're going to group by patron type definition.

339
00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.300
Anthony Taylor: Everybody see that.

340
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:49.410
Anthony Taylor: And then last, it says, Create a bar. But our bar chart of the total checkouts and patron type definition. So let's start right here.

341
00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:53.730
Anthony Taylor: So let's call this library, lo.

342
00:32:55.610 --> 00:33:00.530
Anthony Taylor: underscore Dia. And we're just gonna take our data frame.

343
00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:07.579
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna well, we're gonna create a new one based on the library usage. Df.

344
00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:09.320
Anthony Taylor: and then bracket

345
00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.050
Anthony Taylor: total checkouts

346
00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.670
Anthony Taylor: greater than 0

347
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:22.310
Anthony Taylor: and then we went every oh. so what?

348
00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:29.560
Anthony Taylor: Every column or every row, every column that has that? Okay. So that will give us

349
00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:30.810
Anthony Taylor: that

350
00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:39.469
Anthony Taylor: bugs me that that doesn't split. So let's just take a look at that.

351
00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:46.240
Dipinto, Matt: Is that right? I feel like it's yelling at you to use square brackets. It's angry about your parentheses.

352
00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.119
Masarirambi, Rodney: darn it, yeah.

353
00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:53.680
Mckimmy, Brandon: Is it the Epsilons? We capitalize a data frame

354
00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.410
Anthony Taylor: took you guys long enough to find this.

355
00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:06.700
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So there's that one. So where else do I need put bracket? How about library? Dflo?

356
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:11.160
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And then we have

357
00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:13.260
Anthony Taylor: bracket

358
00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:18.700
Anthony Taylor: man. I did so many things wrong on that. And you guys just let me go.

359
00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:28.770
Dipinto, Matt: We're gonna it's gonna take forever. Let me go forever. And your pandas dot data frame at the head of this is unnecessary. In the first place, because the output of a Loke is another data frame.

360
00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:37.129
Anthony Taylor: You're making this pain plan. You're doing good. I love it.

361
00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:40.950
Masarirambi, Rodney: Feel free to just graduate us right now, and we can just move on. It's so cool.

362
00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:43.479
Dipinto, Matt: I think

363
00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:49.989
Anthony Taylor: module pandas has no attribute data frame. What

364
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:55.099
Dipinto, Matt: delete actually, that doesn't make frames section.

365
00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:59.870
Anthony Taylor: You saw me get rid of it. I'm gonna get rid of it. Let's just get rid of it.

366
00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:01.620
Anthony Taylor: Let's see if that works

367
00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.130
Anthony Taylor: hot dog.

368
00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:13.030
Anthony Taylor: I don't think I've ever been able to get away with that many screw ups in one line before someone started yelling at.

369
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:16.109
Anthony Taylor: so good job. Okay.

370
00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:28.660
Anthony Taylor: alright. So now we can see our data frame. We can see our total checkouts no longer have any 0 counts as far as we can tell from what we can see. So next, we're going to split data. And it said, Split it by Patreon

371
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:31.759
Anthony Taylor: groups. So let's use patron groups

372
00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:37.289
Anthony Taylor: equals. And we're going to take our our new data frame

373
00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:43.440
Anthony Taylor: and do a group buy on the exact column. It says to do it up.

374
00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:47.450
Anthony Taylor: Patron type definition. In fact, I can just copy this

375
00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:49.200
Anthony Taylor: right from there.

376
00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.220
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

377
00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:58.619
Anthony Taylor: and now that we have that, we're gonna? Do account of over checkouts.

378
00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:01.620
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to say, patron borrowers.

379
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:08.469
Anthony Taylor: equals. And we're going to take our new groups. Object that we just created.

380
00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:13.300
Anthony Taylor: Tell it we want you to take total counts our checkouts. Sorry

381
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:18.500
Anthony Taylor: and do account

382
00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:27.760
Anthony Taylor: I like. So let's let's stop this one right here and check this out. Let's see what patron borrowers looks like.

383
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:35.840
Anthony Taylor: There we go. So what do we got here? Is it data frame or a theory?

384
00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:47.100
Anthony Taylor: So, siri, siri, and we have a key, and we have. So we have an X and a y.

385
00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:57.159
Anthony Taylor: so we have our X and Y. This is what we were trying to get. Now, we can simply chart it out, and we can assign this to a variable.

386
00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:01.270
Anthony Taylor: because, like well, I'll wait. No, we're not. We're used. The name of the data frame

387
00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:12.550
Anthony Taylor: patron chart equals patron, borrows Patreon borrowers and dot thought

388
00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:19.730
Anthony Taylor: parentheses, and in the parentheses are in view kind equals. Bar

389
00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.080
title

390
00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:26.519
Anthony Taylor: equals library usage by patron type.

391
00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:39.870
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And we could just X label Y label in here. But just to keep us on our toes.

392
00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:43.720
Anthony Taylor: Let's put those out here.

393
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:47.119
Anthony Taylor: Dot set X label

394
00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.410
Anthony Taylor: parentheses. patron type.

395
00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:57.780
Anthony Taylor: And

396
00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:01.030
Anthony Taylor: yep.

397
00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:04.380
Anthony Taylor: it's trying to get a donation.

398
00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.510
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's it.

399
00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:11.410
Anthony Taylor: Underscore y label.

400
00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:24.570
Anthony Taylor: wow. I just had like the weirdest moment ever. I stopped and looked down at my fingers and realized I can't find the underscore

401
00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:29.420
Anthony Taylor: because I looked down at my fingers. You guys ever had that happen? That was weird.

402
00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:36.270
Anthony Taylor: I'm like, Wait, where's I like, literally kind of went into a little panic. There for a second. I'm like, Wait, where? Where's the underscore?

403
00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:45.389
Anthony Taylor: You know it's one of those keys you never look at. Just kind of know where it is. Look at that, Kitty cat as

404
00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.860
Anthony Taylor: and then we can do a show

405
00:38:49.600 --> 00:39:00.899
Anthony Taylor:  and we'll clean it up at the same time. It's always good to do this, especially with the pandas ones.

406
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:03.180
Anthony Taylor: It just makes them cleaner

407
00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:14.240
Anthony Taylor: any questions about what we did there. II didn't really try to explain this, but I mean, we've talked about this like a bunch of times. So I'm not too worried about that.

408
00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:21.480
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so real quick recap we grouped by, we got account, which gave us a series.

409
00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:26.290
Anthony Taylor: The series means we have our X and Y, we did bar. It used

410
00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:37.610
Anthony Taylor: the X, the the series index as the X-axis, and the value as to why. And we end up with this. Okay.

411
00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:38.570
Anthony Taylor: Hi.

412
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:41.250
Anthony Taylor: so

413
00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:50.720
Anthony Taylor: we're now going to take the same base data frame. So the original data frame and create some code that will allow you to create individual bar charts

414
00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:52.389
Anthony Taylor: for each

415
00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.140
Anthony Taylor: library branch.

416
00:39:55.750 --> 00:40:02.779
Anthony Taylor: This part of activity we're going to use. We're going. And we want you to chart the total checkouts of library

417
00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:05.060
Anthony Taylor: sorted by patron type.

418
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:11.389
Anthony Taylor: If you're able to try and come up with a method to do this using lobe or ilope filter the original data frame.

419
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:16.600
Anthony Taylor: All right, since there's quite a lot of patriot types with minimal checkouts.

420
00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:18.680
Anthony Taylor: the pie charts.

421
00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:22.590
Anthony Taylor: This is why have I shown you guys how to do a pie chart.

422
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:25.810
Anthony Taylor: I have not.

423
00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:29.600
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And just out of curiosity.

424
00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:36.179
Anthony Taylor: what do you think we might need to change? Make pie chart

425
00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.240
Sihong Zhou: kind

426
00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:41.960
Sihong Zhou: equals 2 pi.

427
00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:44.439
Anthony Taylor: actually, let's see if this one will do it.

428
00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:52.990
Anthony Taylor: Whoa! We made a pie chart. Okay, it's ugly, but it is a pie chart. Okay. alright. But

429
00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:59.779
Anthony Taylor: rather than like, throw that at you guys, let's there's a little more to it than just making the chart. So let's just go ahead and do.

430
00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.539
Anthony Taylor: So first, we're gonna create some library groups.

431
00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:09.109
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And this is from our original data frame.

432
00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:11.220
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna do dot group by.

433
00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:20.870
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to group by 2 columns. So I need to give it a list of columns, right? So we're going to say, home.

434
00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:30.000
Anthony Taylor: library. death depth finishing alright. And then

435
00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:33.340
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna do

436
00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:40.140
Anthony Taylor: patron type definition.

437
00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.460
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So that's going to be our group buyout.

438
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:45.750
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

439
00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:48.889
Anthony Taylor: So with that group by.

440
00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:54.579
Anthony Taylor: I want to sum the total checkouts by that group.

441
00:41:54.650 --> 00:42:03.900
Anthony Taylor: So I'm gonna create another variable. We'll call this one sum it up. And we're going to say, Take library groups

442
00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:14.630
Anthony Taylor: and do. Oh, and we wanna do it on the total checkouts column again. So we gotta put that in there.

443
00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:20.780
Anthony Taylor: Oh, my God, Ness.

444
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.580
Anthony Taylor: alright! And then we're just gonna say, Dot.

445
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.890
so

446
00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:34.249
Anthony Taylor: okay? And last we got to do is take a look at it and see it. What it looks like. What's this gonna return anybody anybody

447
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.020
Vasquez, Gabriel: an error.

448
00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:43.110
Vasquez, Gabriel: an error, because checkout needs an S.

449
00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:46.709
Anthony Taylor: Dang it. That was good game.

450
00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:56.790
Anthony Taylor: that was good. That was good. And you know what I didn't do that. What a purpose? So gave you get a cookie today? Okay, so

451
00:42:57.470 --> 00:43:02.110
Anthony Taylor: this one's a little more interesting. But let me ask you, is this, the Data Framework series.

452
00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:05.419
Anthony Taylor: this one's tricky.

453
00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:11.029
Dipinto, Matt: the Index series.

454
00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:21.540
Anthony Taylor: It's it is a dual index series. Absolutely. Absolutely. Remember, data frames. The one thing about data frames in

455
00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:25.679
Anthony Taylor: use Jupyter notebooks. They always have this alternating

456
00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:27.870
Anthony Taylor: color scheme.

457
00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:36.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Like always. So you can always tell it's not a data frame. If it doesn't have that alternative.

458
00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:38.749
Anthony Taylor: So that was good.

459
00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:44.339
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So let's create an individual branch variable.

460
00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.460
Anthony Taylor: So we'll start with

461
00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:48.420
hands up.

462
00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:50.430
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

463
00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:58.349
Anthony Taylor: And let's have another variable that says, make another one called min checkouts.

464
00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:01.919
Anthony Taylor: And this will be like.

465
00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:09.030
Anthony Taylor: we only want to look at a library that has less than say, 5,000 checkouts. Okay.

466
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:16.719
Anthony Taylor: now, we're going to. And this is where it gets kind of cool. So we're gonna say, just one branch

467
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:26.190
Anthony Taylor: equals. We're going to use this new series, and we're just going to say I want

468
00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:27.490
Anthony Taylor: one branch

469
00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:31.760
Anthony Taylor: now, because it is an index.

470
00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:33.709
Anthony Taylor: All we have to do

471
00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:42.380
Anthony Taylor: is type, dot loaf bracket and put in that variable. this one right here.

472
00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:48.599
Anthony Taylor: We don't need to do equals anything. We don't do anything because it's an index. You don't need to do that anymore.

473
00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:53.340
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so and actually, let's just take a look at what this looks like

474
00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:59.460
Anthony Taylor: before we run the rest of that cell. So now, you can see, we have just Ansa's data.

475
00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:04.550
Anthony Taylor: So you can see Anza adult, 8, 5, 5, 9, 9, 4, 8, 5, 5, 9, 9, 4.

476
00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.200
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

477
00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:13.409
Anthony Taylor: so now let's make sure. So notice.

478
00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:16.330
Anthony Taylor: some of these have less than 5,000.

479
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:23.500
Anthony Taylor: So now that we have this, let's get rid of those. Okay, so we'll say, just one branch

480
00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:26.890
Anthony Taylor: equals just one branch

481
00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:29.030
Anthony Taylor: dot loke

482
00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:33.970
Anthony Taylor: bracket.

483
00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:41.460
Anthony Taylor: I was going to do parentheses again, but I'm like I already did that one. So be original. Just one branch bracket debt, total

484
00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.410
Anthony Taylor: check out

485
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:50.030
Anthony Taylor:  and then

486
00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.600
Anthony Taylor: been underscore

487
00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:58.440
Anthony Taylor: checkouts. Okay.

488
00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.389
Anthony Taylor: kind of give me everything.

489
00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:07.090
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So now we'll get guests. In fact, we can even like move this to here

490
00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:09.070
and run this again.

491
00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:12.409
Anthony Taylor: And we got a key error.

492
00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:16.350
Anthony Taylor: But I do wrong.

493
00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.770
Anthony Taylor: Actually, hold on.

494
00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:30.669
Masarirambi, Rodney: Yeah. Can you show us that myself?

495
00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:33.979
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, it's here. Total checkout.

496
00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:39.930
Dipinto, Matt: But just one branch toll series.

497
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.719
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. But still should give me

498
00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:51.390
Anthony Taylor: trying to think of where I typed something.

499
00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:57.300
Anthony Taylor: Hold on. Let's comment this one out. Let's run this again.

500
00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:00.390
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

501
00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:09.770
Anthony Taylor: I did something weird there.

502
00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:15.380
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Let me come back to that just a second. Let's go ahead and do the bar and then figure out

503
00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:25.459
Baro, Sonja: I'm just asking the series column. Doesn't. Does it know that it's total checkouts?

504
00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:34.009
Anthony Taylor: I I'm thinking there's something weird going on. But I ran this in the South, and I don't want to go look at the solve yet. Let's go ahead and do the bar. Then we'll go check and see

505
00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:45.909
Anthony Taylor: what I typed wrong, because I must have something wrong in there. I don't see it so rather than spend a ton of time on it, I'll do that. But let's let's go and do the bar chart, because that's really the lesson

506
00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:49.249
Anthony Taylor: branch bar equals.

507
00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:57.210
Anthony Taylor: And so again, we're going to do just one branch. Dot plots kind.

508
00:47:57.530 --> 00:48:01.809
Anthony Taylor: It's interesting. They're asking for a bar, not a pie. After they focus up above.

509
00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:04.109
Anthony Taylor: we were going to do a pie. But whatever

510
00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:07.490
Anthony Taylor:  And

511
00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:15.079
Anthony Taylor: now this one's interesting because we're actually gonna give it. Well, let's not. Let's see what happens.

512
00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:20.000
Anthony Taylor: Let's see what happens. Title equals.

513
00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:28.610
Anthony Taylor: Oh, this is interesting. So let's make this an F string.

514
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:32.390
Anthony Taylor: We're going to do loans of

515
00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:35.440
Anthony Taylor: branch

516
00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:44.740
Anthony Taylor:  branch. So the word, remember, it's gonna be Anza. So you're gonna say, Anza branch

517
00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:48.779
Anthony Taylor: 4 patron types

518
00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:50.220
Anthony Taylor: over.

519
00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:56.519
Anthony Taylor: I mean, actually this, we're not. We didn't do that part. So maybe not.

520
00:48:57.130 --> 00:49:00.520
Anthony Taylor: Min checkouts low

521
00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:05.100
Anthony Taylor: items. That's a really long title.

522
00:49:05.850 --> 00:49:07.890
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So

523
00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:12.500
Anthony Taylor: then let's just show that

524
00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.859
Anthony Taylor: I want to see it, cause I want to know why that did.

525
00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:17.860
Sorry.

526
00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:20.640
Anthony Taylor: Let that show

527
00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:23.969
Anthony Taylor: bought that tight layout

528
00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:27.220
Anthony Taylor: and let's run that. Oh.

529
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:29.680
Anthony Taylor: oh.

530
00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:34.970
Anthony Taylor: alright! Hold on! I think I know. What

531
00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:45.640
Anthony Taylor: what did I do? I broke it somewhere. But

532
00:49:45.930 --> 00:49:57.490
Mckimmy, Brandon: notice, the loc has the same variable down there as the other one. It's like you didn't define as a new variable. The crazy part is, it actually showed it

533
00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:02.630
Anthony Taylor: when we did this a minute ago.

534
00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:07.380
Anthony Taylor: before we did the filter. Oh.

535
00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:10.360
Anthony Taylor: oh, I left that in there. Okay.

536
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:12.129
Anthony Taylor: I see what I did

537
00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:15.310
Anthony Taylor: that should fix it.

538
00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:18.300
Anthony Taylor: Here we go. Okay.

539
00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:26.320
Anthony Taylor: So we have some that are low. We'll fix. We'll figure out what happened there. But basically, this is what we were shooting for. Okay, now

540
00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:28.759
Anthony Taylor: let's go see why that

541
00:50:31.410 --> 00:50:34.890
Anthony Taylor: let's make sure it does actually work. See? It totally works.

542
00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:37.110
Anthony Taylor: So

543
00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:41.790
Anthony Taylor: patron groups.

544
00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:51.619
Anthony Taylor: patron borrowers. Oh, that's the first. Sorry the city second. Yep, that one works, too. So just one branch total checkouts.

545
00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:57.790
Anthony Taylor: I have a typo here somewhere.

546
00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:07.289
Anthony Taylor: I'll show you guys. And if you guys haven't seen this, this is a cool trick to

547
00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:29.840
Anthony Taylor:  okay, I compared it to the wrong one.

548
00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:32.560
Anthony Taylor: Let's just close those.

549
00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:39.979
Anthony Taylor: So if you guys ever want to compare 2 files like side by side like that, where it shows you the whole thing

550
00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:44.009
Anthony Taylor: that this is a very cool Vs code.

551
00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:49.070
Anthony Taylor: I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on this. But I definitely want

552
00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:55.079
Anthony Taylor: I'm really curious because I don't see the typo. so I'm pretty sure it's just a type of

553
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:59.350
Anthony Taylor: Oh, my goodness, how many freaking things do I have

554
00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.260
Masarirambi, Rodney: 17?

555
00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:12.440
Anthony Taylor: Thank you. Alright. So we have this one and that one man palette.

556
00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:14.450
Anthony Taylor: active file with

557
00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:17.180
Anthony Taylor: solution. There we go

558
00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:18.900
Anthony Taylor: alright. So

559
00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:33.739
Meredith McCanse (she/her): so what does this mean that you're like? It's red on one side and green on the other side. But unfortunately, but what's happening is

560
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:42.140
Anthony Taylor: is, I have to save this one because it's It's using the save the not saved version.

561
00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:47.739
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so so it's showing like, everything is different which is not accurate.

562
00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:50.390
Anthony Taylor: So let's go back and do that again.

563
00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:53.300
Solution.

564
00:52:54.450 --> 00:52:56.749
Anthony Taylor: There we go. This looks a little better.

565
00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:01.310
Anthony Taylor: Oh, really. group I

566
00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:14.030
Anthony Taylor: it's not lining them up. Sell for sale because I was moving things around. So we need to find this one

567
00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:18.070
Anthony Taylor: and compare it to

568
00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:20.800
Anthony Taylor: this one.

569
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:22.400
that

570
00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:24.940
Anthony Taylor: the people that were there.

571
00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:29.860
Anthony Taylor: this one

572
00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:32.980
Anthony Taylor: that's not very helpful at all.

573
00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:39.129
Masarirambi, Rodney: When I just copy the lines. That that's the only thing we can do.

574
00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:44.619
Anthony Taylor: We could also, just for giggles.

575
00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:47.899
Anthony Taylor: We could do this.

576
00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:51.790
michael mcpherson: You could clear out, puts and restart your kernel.

577
00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:55.910
Anthony Taylor: That's not a bad idea, but I don't think that's the problem.

578
00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:18.260
Anthony Taylor: It's

579
00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:21.970
Anthony Taylor: didn't change anything

580
00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:25.730
Anthony Taylor: that's so weird.

581
00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:35.110
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Well. I'll figure it out where you guys are break for something, cause there is something there's gotta be something, cause it just doesn't break for no reason.

582
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:44.400
Anthony Taylor: So there's branch ends and men's checkout. Just one branch, sum it up, branch just one branch slope, total checkouts, min checkouts.

583
00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:49.870
Anthony Taylor: just one branch, just one branch

584
00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:54.909
Anthony Taylor: local, just one branch brackets, total checkouts

585
00:54:55.670 --> 00:55:00.520
Anthony Taylor: greater than in checkouts. Only thing I can think of is, maybe we set an index up here.

586
00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:03.859
Anthony Taylor: Alright. I'll take a look at it.

587
00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:12.120
Anthony Taylor: I'll figure it out. Yeah, Kevin, do you guys, you got it? Did you see it? I should have just asked you to begin with. what's wrong.

588
00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:14.690
Anthony Taylor: Kevin?

589
00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:19.129
Anthony Taylor: You had your hand up.

590
00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:22.529
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, you did.

591
00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:32.500
Kevin Nguyen: Oh, II didn't. I didn't.

592
00:55:36.590 --> 00:55:40.280
Anthony Taylor: This is how homework feels when you're like what the heck is it? I agree.

593
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:48.129
Anthony Taylor: But here's the. So I want you guys to do this because I mean, I hope you guys feel this way about these things

594
00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:59.850
Anthony Taylor: when I'm doing this kind of stuff. And I get stuck like that. Yeah, I'm frustrated. I'm disappointed. you know, that I can't like just instantly give you the answer.

595
00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:02.770
Anthony Taylor: But I'm gonna feel really good when I figure it out.

596
00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:05.179
Anthony Taylor: That's gonna be like, yes.

597
00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:06.340
Anthony Taylor: figured it out.

598
00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:12.049
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So you know, embrace the good stuff, that's all I can tell.

599
00:56:12.310 --> 00:56:14.499
Anthony Taylor: Okay. What time is it

600
00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:15.800
Anthony Taylor: to help?

601
00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:22.819
Anthony Taylor: I think we can do break now, that'll give me time to look at this, too. So

602
00:56:23.790 --> 00:56:27.570
Anthony Taylor: fussy. In 15Â min, 8, 15. Have a nice break.

603
00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:44.230
Anthony Taylor: Hmm.

604
00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:04.050
Anthony Taylor: welcome back.

605
00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:06.730
Anthony Taylor: Who are

606
00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:08.890
Anthony Taylor: okay?

607
00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:18.460
Anthony Taylor: So what it turned out actually is, we had one bracket which did make you the Double Index series, which is totally cool, but not

608
00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:24.559
Anthony Taylor:  We wanted this to be a data frame so that we could

609
00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:26.870
Anthony Taylor: filter total checkouts.

610
00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:32.069
Anthony Taylor: So once you make it into data, frame, it works beautifully.

611
00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:36.929
Anthony Taylor: Way cool. So that's what the problem was.

612
00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:41.270
Anthony Taylor: Yay, it's a alright. So

613
00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:46.529
Anthony Taylor: oh, we're gonna jump right into it. Now, this activity

614
00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:48.800
Anthony Taylor: not bad at all.

615
00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:54.860
Anthony Taylor:  so basically, you're gonna create a scatter box.

616
00:57:54.970 --> 00:57:59.679
Anthony Taylor: Now, I'll give you the good news. It's not Lt scab

617
00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:07.290
Anthony Taylor: or kind equals step. It's still  turn it.

618
00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:16.840
Anthony Taylor: You're gonna make this, and all you have to do is use. Well, I'll let you find out

619
00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:22.559
Anthony Taylor: alright. So the good news is all of the data preparation. This one is pretty simple.

620
00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:24.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

621
00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:29.259
Anthony Taylor: alright. So you get 15Â min.

622
00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:39.730
Anthony Taylor: hey? Soon? Alright! How are you. Did you ever you know what I sent out that broadcast kind of late? Did everybody see it

623
00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:47.209
Anthony Taylor: about the question Marks? Did anybody even find know about the question marks.

624
00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:49.920
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, we got the air multiple times.

625
00:58:50.790 --> 00:58:53.699
michael mcpherson: Matt. Question mark Curry.

626
00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:56.979
Baro, Sonja: What broadcast

627
00:58:58.450 --> 00:59:04.799
Anthony Taylor: I sent out broadcast, probably like 2Â min left explaining there was a question. Mark Perry. Well, how did you find it?

628
00:59:05.330 --> 00:59:07.189
Gardner, Curry: Just by

629
00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:10.969
Gardner, Curry: going into the or I guess I did.

630
00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:14.359
Gardner, Curry: I was trying to change the type of

631
00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:24.570
Gardner, Curry: car data. And it said, invalid literal for int with base 10. And then in quotes question, mark.

632
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:26.939
Anthony Taylor: that's one way. Oh, yeah.

633
00:59:27.590 --> 00:59:34.279
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, so there was a question mark in the data. So and and yeah, and I,

634
00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:46.470
Anthony Taylor: while it's relatively simple to get rid of, it was not easy to see you needed to do a value counts, or something like that to actually see it. So

635
00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:53.139
Baro, Sonja: right, that's that's where I got stuck. And I build a par string question mark.

636
00:59:54.800 --> 01:00:03.609
Anthony Taylor: So alright. So let's let's go through it real quick. So we have import. We got our data. So yeah, so see in horsepower. You can't see that question.

637
01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:16.090
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but if you do like a value counselor, you examine it. You would see that there is, in fact, one and all you got to do to get rid of the missing values is filter it out.

638
01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:21.320
Anthony Taylor: So in this case many of you probably went to drop in a I would guess

639
01:00:21.550 --> 01:00:27.439
Anthony Taylor: right, which makes perfect sense, except for in this case the missing values at a default

640
01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:28.510
Anthony Taylor: value.

641
01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:35.579
Anthony Taylor: which was Westermart. Okay? So once you do that, you have data that you can now

642
01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:39.320
Anthony Taylor: index if you're or you could have actually have set it to an integer. Now.

643
01:00:39.570 --> 01:00:47.079
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna set the index to the car name. We're gonna get rid of the origin. We don't need it. It's all the same value.

644
01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:59.620
Anthony Taylor: Take a look at our data gorgeous. And now we're going to change horsepower to a number because we're going to use it in our chart. And we're going to say, plot

645
01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:04.260
Anthony Taylor: time equals. Scatter X horsepower Y in FG.

646
01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:14.699
Anthony Taylor: Let's put a grid on there and a title and take a look at what we get. and we can definitely see, there is a correlation here.

647
01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:18.440
Anthony Taylor: Okay. definitely

648
01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:25.710
Anthony Taylor: for her any questions

649
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.899
Anthony Taylor: feeling okay with that one? I mean there other than the stupid question mark.

650
01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:43.059
Baro, Sonja: So in that case, Anthony, like normally, when we would do this, we would do a little review of the data right?

651
01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:48.859
Anthony Taylor: Yes, I wish it would have told. Actually did it tell you, did anybody get the reason?

652
01:01:50.410 --> 01:01:51.750
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, anyway, go ahead.

653
01:01:52.240 --> 01:02:00.329
Baro, Sonja: No. And that's just my point, right? Is so like we just we don't. We didn't get a chance, or we didn't have time to look at it to see

654
01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:06.349
cause we did talk about using look, but it was like, Oh, well, why why not? Just you drop in a so

655
01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:14.450
Anthony Taylor: well? And I mean, there were like, I said, there were 2 ways that you were gonna find this and that was to actually go look at the data

656
01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:16.319
Anthony Taylor: right? Or

657
01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:21.800
Anthony Taylor: like the way Curry found it. Just tried to convert it to an int. And it gave him an error that makes sense.

658
01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:23.940
Baro, Sonja: Yeah, that kind of exposed it.

659
01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:26.920
Anthony Taylor: And there, you see right there, yeah.

660
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:40.449
Baro, Sonja: But to your other comment, I feel pretty good cause I was really close. I got there. Well, I mean, it's a good II actually don't mind this activity so much, because

661
01:02:40.730 --> 01:02:50.779
Anthony Taylor: this is like. I mean, this is real real. Okay, where you look at the data. And then it doesn't work the way you hope it does. And that means you gotta dig deeper

662
01:02:50.890 --> 01:02:55.809
Anthony Taylor: if you started to dig deeper. Then then you understand, and you're on the right track.

663
01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:58.749
So you're doing fine.

664
01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:04.370
Anthony Taylor: But so let's look at the next exercise.

665
01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:15.570
Anthony Taylor:  so we got some data. We're gonna pull in unemployment values. Notice, we're going to merge. I know this is Clayton's favorite. We're gonna merge.

666
01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:30.400
Anthony Taylor: not even a smurf, not even a likes. Bite me, Anthony. Okay, so because we merge, we do have a couple of columns that overlap primarily, this country Code X and country Code Y,

667
01:03:30.570 --> 01:03:39.449
Anthony Taylor: so we're going to just get rid of Y. We don't need both of them. And then we're going to rename country Code X to just country code. And look at our data again.

668
01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:41.250
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

669
01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:46.949
Anthony Taylor: so now, we have country name, country code and values for every year

670
01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:48.649
Anthony Taylor: from 10 to 20.

671
01:03:50.020 --> 01:04:02.099
Anthony Taylor: We're going to set the index to country code cause in a little bit. We're going to use that index to do a quick search.  here, we're going to collect the mean unemployment rates

672
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:06.090
Anthony Taylor: for the world world world.

673
01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:08.550
Anthony Taylor: It felt like it needed an echo.

674
01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:12.039
Anthony Taylor: Right? Okay, so what does that mean? Well.

675
01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:18.399
Anthony Taylor: this is kind of a weird implementation. It's not bad. But I want you guys to see it.

676
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:31.039
Anthony Taylor: So we have combined unemployment data. That's this one. All right. Here we have a list comprehension that's going to give us for year between 2, 10 and 2, 21. So

677
01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:35.780
Anthony Taylor: every year, 14,011, 2,012, etc.

678
01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:39.270
Anthony Taylor: And it's going to turn that into a string

679
01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.039
Anthony Taylor: and then give us the mean.

680
01:04:43.410 --> 01:04:47.979
Anthony Taylor: So what does that mean? Unemployed data, the first ones 2,010

681
01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:50.360
Anthony Taylor: mean of 2,010.

682
01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:58.470
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And it's just it's just a really cool way to output the the mean of each one.

683
01:04:58.670 --> 01:05:04.570
Anthony Taylor:  After that we're going to grab average unemployment this value right here

684
01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:09.769
Anthony Taylor: and just pull the keys out into this variable. So

685
01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:12.579
Anthony Taylor: we can look at either one of these.

686
01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:14.900
Anthony Taylor: We'll look at the that one first.

687
01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:20.190
Anthony Taylor: so you can see the average by year was was calculated, and then

688
01:05:21.930 --> 01:05:26.099
Anthony Taylor: we pulled the keys out so that we have a list of just the years.

689
01:05:26.890 --> 01:05:32.080
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we have 2 things now, list of the years and a series with

690
01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:39.169
Anthony Taylor: all of the good stuff in there. Okay. yes, this is the handle. All you need to know right now.

691
01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:46.689
Anthony Taylor:  So world average comma. We don't need any of the other variables. We're going to do plot

692
01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:52.189
Anthony Taylor: and we're gonna say, we want to use our years. So this list

693
01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:55.589
Anthony Taylor: average unemployment, which is this

694
01:05:55.660 --> 01:06:00.209
Anthony Taylor: mean of of year values, feather, blue label world average.

695
01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:01.520
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

696
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:07.360
Anthony Taylor: Now, the point of this lesson, if you didn't see it is plot multiple lines

697
01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:08.870
Anthony Taylor: so we could.

698
01:06:09.110 --> 01:06:12.400
Anthony Taylor: But we can't stop you. I'd have to. Well, no way we could comment this out.

699
01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:16.340
Anthony Taylor: And right here we have a plot

700
01:06:16.570 --> 01:06:18.909
Anthony Taylor: of the averages by year.

701
01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:22.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so

702
01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:37.570
Anthony Taylor: what I want to do, though, is like we did in map lab, when we put multiple lines on a single chart is, I want to use canvas, that data frame to add multiple years on a single chart. So here we have country. One

703
01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:41.300
Anthony Taylor: plot. Here's combined unemployment data.

704
01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:51.730
Anthony Taylor: Which is this one up here? Okay, the whole thing, basically. And we're going to say, Look. U.S.A.,

705
01:06:53.090 --> 01:06:56.180
Anthony Taylor: comma all these years.

706
01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:03.709
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then. And so that's what we're gonna do. So U.S.A. is, why does she's putting U.S.A. there, do anything.

707
01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:18.940
Anthony Taylor: Remember, we set the index to country code. So by putting U.S.A., it just effectively put a filter there. So it's the equivalent of saying country code equals U.S.A.

708
01:07:19.550 --> 01:07:29.120
Anthony Taylor: alright. And then we're gonna add, ask for all of these columns. We're gonna color it green, and we're gonna label it, U.S.A. comma country name art.

709
01:07:29.290 --> 01:07:35.309
Anthony Taylor: Sorry the label's going to be the low U.S.A. column country name.

710
01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:42.169
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then we're also gonna throw a legend in there. And this is what we end up with.

711
01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:48.829
Anthony Taylor: Do you have your world average. And you're in the United States average

712
01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:52.220
Anthony Taylor: pretty cool. Huh?

713
01:07:54.420 --> 01:08:04.700
Anthony Taylor: So let's talk about this one more time, because it's the main part of this lesson. Okay. you you don't actually have to do the handles unless you're doing the legend this way. Remember.

714
01:08:04.730 --> 01:08:09.220
Anthony Taylor: technically, don't need all of this stuff in here, but it's good to learn this.

715
01:08:09.350 --> 01:08:11.639
Anthony Taylor: If you want to do legends, it's pretty cool.

716
01:08:12.010 --> 01:08:14.690
Anthony Taylor: Actually, now I think about it.

717
01:08:21.029 --> 01:08:34.539
Anthony Taylor: this first one's really this one is not using Panda. Stop, fly. This one is using plot plot. Which means it's using map Flatlib. And we're passing in the data frame columns

718
01:08:34.779 --> 01:08:36.279
Anthony Taylor: down here.

719
01:08:37.670 --> 01:08:40.879
Anthony Taylor: We're going to do data, frame dot plot

720
01:08:42.010 --> 01:08:51.050
Anthony Taylor: combined unemployment data. We're Gonna look@usa. 2,010 through 2,020, put in a legend and show. And look at that.

721
01:08:51.689 --> 01:08:53.799
Anthony Taylor: So everything we did up here

722
01:08:55.180 --> 01:09:01.890
Anthony Taylor: pretty much from here to here. That was map Platib. This is how easy that same thing is to do

723
01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:05.830
Anthony Taylor: in data frame that plot.

724
01:09:06.850 --> 01:09:10.169
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So again, as Clayton pointed out.

725
01:09:10.510 --> 01:09:13.730
Anthony Taylor: why would you do this? Then you can simply do this.

726
01:09:16.029 --> 01:09:19.229
Anthony Taylor: Okay. yeah.

727
01:09:20.290 --> 01:09:27.709
Baro, Sonja: so is the difference between the 2 methods of using either map Plotlib or the pandas.

728
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:39.140
Baro, Sonja: was it? Simply it? It's the use of the handles versus and plot plot versus the data frame dot plot.

729
01:09:39.819 --> 01:09:47.729
Anthony Taylor: So Pandas takes care of the handles and the legend thing, okay? So you don't need the handles. That is correct.

730
01:09:47.899 --> 01:09:57.949
Anthony Taylor: The the this is the data frame dot plot versus plt plot. Remember, Plt is actually 5 plot.

731
01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:01.050
Baro, Sonja: So that's the clue, right?

732
01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:04.850
Anthony Taylor: That's like the first one where you need to go. Oh, yeah, that's that's something.

733
01:10:05.370 --> 01:10:06.290
Anthony Taylor: right.

734
01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:12.220
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, the main point of this exercise is show you that you can

735
01:10:12.510 --> 01:10:18.219
Anthony Taylor: something like this, a lot more, with a lot less. Okay.

736
01:10:18.850 --> 01:10:23.630
Anthony Taylor: But again. if you wanted to do something besides basic.

737
01:10:24.970 --> 01:10:27.180
Anthony Taylor: I can't hear you. So I don't say anything for a second.

738
01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:29.480
Anthony Taylor: Basic

739
01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:32.839
Anthony Taylor: stuff you would

740
01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:35.380
Anthony Taylor: want to use.

741
01:10:38.290 --> 01:10:44.160
Anthony Taylor: Here you go. Thank you. Sorry. My headphones were dying. I was

742
01:10:44.410 --> 01:10:48.179
Anthony Taylor: fill in the blank.

743
01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:50.070
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright.

744
01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:52.649
Anthony Taylor: So that's pretty much that

745
01:10:53.490 --> 01:11:01.289
Anthony Taylor: again, I like, I said. I don't think this one is terrible. Let me take a quick look. How are we doing on time? We're doing pretty good.

746
01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:02.930
Anthony Taylor: Oh.

747
01:11:03.450 --> 01:11:08.450
Anthony Taylor: oh, we're gonna start this one. Okay, so this next, this is kind of a fun

748
01:11:10.290 --> 01:11:12.810
Anthony Taylor: thing. Okay,

749
01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:16.620
Anthony Taylor: we're. Gonna it's a three-part activity.

750
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:23.859
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So it's it's it realistic. Ish.

751
01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:26.240
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So

752
01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:29.700
Anthony Taylor: what we're gonna do. is

753
01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:37.410
Anthony Taylor: it? It says, look at the slideshow. But if I recall, there's literally nothing in this slide show. let me just check.

754
01:11:43.230 --> 01:11:48.420
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So there's a part one, a part, 2, part 3. So in part one, you have 3 separate Csv.

755
01:11:48.770 --> 01:12:00.509
Anthony Taylor: okay.  you're going to merge them together. Created chart to visualize a comparison of travelers to Malaysia from different countries.

756
01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:16.189
Anthony Taylor: Alright. this is just part one. So let's go look at what they give you. Alright. So you have 3 different data frames.

757
01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:21.629
Anthony Taylor: You're going to merge the first 2 on country of nationality. It's going to give you this met

758
01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:30.150
Anthony Taylor: alright, and I know this is again. This is some of your favorite moments. However, I will be

759
01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:32.210
Anthony Taylor: Mr. Wonderful

760
01:12:33.810 --> 01:12:37.300
Anthony Taylor: and give you the rename code

761
01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:42.380
Anthony Taylor: cause. I'm pretty certain you all know how to do it, and it's just a ton of freaking type.

762
01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:46.740
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So let me give you that.

763
01:12:49.060 --> 01:13:00.340
Anthony Taylor: I'm not worried that you guys don't know how to do if you don't when you see it. If it's like, totally like what the heck is that? Then please review that.

764
01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:01.560
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

765
01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:03.530
Baro, Sonja: thank you, Anthony.

766
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:05.139
Anthony Taylor: There's the code.

767
01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:08.000
Anthony Taylor: and I'll put it in here so you guys can see it.

768
01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:09.480
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

769
01:13:11.150 --> 01:13:13.289
Anthony Taylor: So I just gave you this code in slack.

770
01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:28.570
Anthony Taylor: You could have actually copied this and copied this and do it together fairly quickly, but it's still a lot of work. Alright. Okay. So once you have that done it says merge our new frame. So you're gonna merge the first 2 with a third one

771
01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:32.009
Anthony Taylor: alright, and then you have to do a rename again.

772
01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:38.680
Anthony Taylor: It's not nearly as bad as the first one. In fact, you could pretty much copy

773
01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:47.440
Anthony Taylor: one of these and just make some small changes. So I'm not gonna give that one to you. And that's it. That's all you gotta do. Yeah, if I would've gave you that last one, there'd been no point in doing the exercise.

774
01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:59.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so for this first part. you have 10Â min. I'd give you 15, but I gave you a big chunk of the typing. So

775
01:13:59.630 --> 01:14:01.430
Anthony Taylor: you should be okay with 10

776
01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:06.140
Anthony Taylor: Clayton, Hafton and Brandon.

777
01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:10.940
Anthony Taylor: Your entire room was muted. What were you doing?

778
01:14:17.770 --> 01:14:19.029
Anthony Taylor: Clayton's frozen.

779
01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:23.820
Anthony Taylor: Brenda? What were you guys doing in your room? All of you guys were muted.

780
01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:29.650
Mckimmy, Brandon: We were working on it telepathically.

781
01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:34.390
Mckimmy, Brandon: Okay, but not really. We actually, we just do it on our own.

782
01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:35.930
Okay.

783
01:14:36.050 --> 01:14:39.580
Anthony Taylor: alright. So let's go through this first one. Did everybody get through it?

784
01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:45.699
Anthony Taylor: It was really just the last rename you had to type out for the most part. So we have the import.

785
01:14:45.710 --> 01:14:52.299
Anthony Taylor: They gave you these first 2 cells, not going to stress too much on that. But everybody knows what's happening. Right? We're reading in the Csv files.

786
01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:56.270
Anthony Taylor: We're joint. We're doing a merge

787
01:14:56.670 --> 01:15:00.209
Anthony Taylor: of the first 2 columns outer on

788
01:15:01.770 --> 01:15:05.970
Anthony Taylor: this column that we're gonna take a quick peek. And it's beautiful.

789
01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:28.719
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but we have all these crazy X values. So here's the rename code that I gave you. We'll just run that if you don't remember this, let's just quickly go through it. It's the data frame name. Rename. What do you want to rename? And then a dictionary object, where the key is the existing column, and the value is what you want the column to be

790
01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:41.029
Anthony Taylor: okay. and that gives us a much cleaner naming. Then we're gonna add 2,018. So it's literally the same thing as up above.

791
01:15:41.130 --> 01:15:50.349
Anthony Taylor: except we're gonna now have some new columns with no anything on them, no prefix or suffix. So

792
01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:53.710
Anthony Taylor: we're going to rename those

793
01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:59.499
Anthony Taylor: to match. So everybody copied from up above and then came down here and just cleaned this up. Right?

794
01:15:59.650 --> 01:16:03.119
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, it's probably the easiest. And then you have that.

795
01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:05.520
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So this is the end of part one.

796
01:16:06.330 --> 01:16:08.010
Anthony Taylor: let's go to part 2,

797
01:16:08.370 --> 01:16:10.520
Dipinto, Matt: but I show. So in part 2

798
01:16:14.250 --> 01:16:22.110
Anthony Taylor: you're going to check out the comments need sales to to to run it. So it's going to tell you a need sell. But here's basically what you're starting with.

799
01:16:22.330 --> 01:16:26.120
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Oh, wait, no, this is what they want. The final team look like.

800
01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:30.409
Anthony Taylor: okay. so let's go look at the instructions.

801
01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:35.740
Anthony Taylor: Note they gave you all of the code that you just hand typed.

802
01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:43.180
Anthony Taylor: And first, they want you to check the mean of the columns. Okay?

803
01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:56.509
Anthony Taylor: Then they want you to get. Do look how they say this reduce columns where mean of traveling companions is greater than one across all years.

804
01:16:58.570 --> 01:17:00.309
Anthony Taylor: Sounds interesting. Yeah.

805
01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:07.739
Anthony Taylor: Anybody have anybody wanna like spit out what they think that might look like?

806
01:17:08.890 --> 01:17:16.139
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Does that mean? Are they when they see reduced columns? Does that mean? They're saying, only look at columns with a mean greater than one?

807
01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:27.219
Anthony Taylor:  they want you to. Oh, this one has a weird thing.

808
01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:32.700
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So what they want you to do in this one is

809
01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:36.760
Anthony Taylor: reduce the columns down to specific

810
01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:39.830
Anthony Taylor: ones and then

811
01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:45.360
Anthony Taylor: set the index to country of nationality. So

812
01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:54.810
Anthony Taylor: yes. So see up in here. I'm so sorry I was. Yes, what you said.

813
01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:59.700
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I wanted to show you. Oh, no. Here we go. Okay. You can see it. So this.

814
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:08.440
Anthony Taylor: you see that you don't want that one. You don't want that. Yeah. Don't want that got it.

815
01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:10.470
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay.

816
01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.980
Anthony Taylor: so is that basically what you were saying, Meredith?

817
01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:25.249
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Sort of. But I wasn't really. I don't know how to do that, or I'd have to figure out how to do it with the

818
01:18:25.650 --> 01:18:27.229
Anthony Taylor: that to get this meat

819
01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:38.989
Baro, Sonja: he's frozen frozen

820
01:18:39.130 --> 01:18:41.419
Masarirambi, Rodney: on the joke about me.

821
01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:44.729
Baro, Sonja: The way to get me.

822
01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:05.850
So how about them mets?

823
01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:10.640
Kevin Nguyen: They're not going to get show a O Tommy, that's for sure.

824
01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:16.709
Masarirambi, Rodney: Dodgers are. Gonna get shelly on, Tony. That's

825
01:19:16.990 --> 01:19:21.259
Mason, Natalie: but it will be lots of touchdowns. So there.

826
01:19:21.410 --> 01:19:25.819
Anthony Taylor: yeah, I came right back. That was weird. That was like a full blown crash.

827
01:19:27.230 --> 01:19:31.810
Anthony Taylor: I'm not sure what's gonna happen. Now hold on, cause. Now it's saying, my bandwidth is low.

828
01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:46.859
Anthony Taylor: That was weird. Okay, so let's try to link to that. My bandwidth is low. That's weird. Okay? So select the types. You're going to include

829
01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:48.390
Anthony Taylor: the the

830
01:19:49.210 --> 01:19:59.159
Anthony Taylor: just those that are numbers. Okay? And then you're gonna grab the average. So there are other ways to do this. But this is a really cool way to get this

831
01:19:59.490 --> 01:20:00.420
Anthony Taylor: right here.

832
01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:08.290
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so basically is only gonna grab the ones that are our type number and then give you the mean for each one.

833
01:20:09.090 --> 01:20:10.510
michael mcpherson: Oh, sorry.

834
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:12.640
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

835
01:20:12.940 --> 01:20:15.710
Anthony Taylor:  And then.

836
01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:24.350
Anthony Taylor: man, that was weird. And what was really weird about it is. Even my gateway warned me that something went wrong. and I was like Whoa!

837
01:20:24.670 --> 01:20:28.920
Anthony Taylor: So this is not a mathematical check.

838
01:20:31.730 --> 01:20:38.859
Anthony Taylor: This is a manual chat. Just look here, I don't want that column.

839
01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:44.639
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Don't want that column. Got it.

840
01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:54.470
Anthony Taylor: You don't need to try to figure out how to programmatically come up with this. Okay? In fact, because of all the typing.

841
01:21:00.030 --> 01:21:02.259
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna totally run out of time one day.

842
01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:05.010
Anthony Taylor: There you go.

843
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:13.730
Anthony Taylor: I just added pretty much what you need, which ones you need for this cell. Okay, lots of type.

844
01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:17.989
Anthony Taylor: And and I don't want. I don't need you to learn how to type

845
01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:31.219
Anthony Taylor: alright. But make sure you at least understand this. Okay? And that's it. So did I actually give you anything to do at all? I absolutely did not.

846
01:21:31.930 --> 01:21:39.350
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we're gonna make this one into an everyone new cause. I just gave you both of the problems that you needed to solve.

847
01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:41.989
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so let's quickly run through this.

848
01:21:44.130 --> 01:21:45.390
Anthony Taylor: So

849
01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:48.790
Anthony Taylor: we've got

850
01:21:49.250 --> 01:21:58.479
Anthony Taylor: data. Gonna do the first merge. The first rename is all what you did in the first step. Same here for the third table.

851
01:21:59.190 --> 01:22:01.340
Anthony Taylor: And the third reading.

852
01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:04.659
Anthony Taylor: okay, so part 2, first thing we're gonna do

853
01:22:04.670 --> 01:22:05.770
Anthony Taylor: is

854
01:22:06.210 --> 01:22:13.779
Anthony Taylor: get the means. Notice, we're not saving this to a variable. We're not trying to do anything. Fancy here, we're simply going to look

855
01:22:14.130 --> 01:22:19.199
Anthony Taylor: at the columns and grab the ones that are greater than one. So we want

856
01:22:19.450 --> 01:22:21.690
Anthony Taylor: these, 1, 2, 3, 4,

857
01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:29.089
Anthony Taylor: 5, 6, (772) 016-1234,

858
01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:30.140
aye.

859
01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:33.469
Anthony Taylor: 6. I miss 1, 1, 2, 3,

860
01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:37.809
Anthony Taylor: 4, 5, 6. So I grab one more than

861
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.890
Anthony Taylor: but, anyway, so you're just gonna grab them manually, put them in here

862
01:22:43.810 --> 01:22:52.060
Anthony Taylor: and set the index the country of nationality. Can you can you slow down for a second? Can you go up?

863
01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:56.490
Raugewitz, Tania: I just want to get the formula for the combine travel types.

864
01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:01.419
Raugewitz, Tania: Oh, this one here, this one here. Got you got you got you? Why, I

865
01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:05.890
Anthony Taylor: oh, did I not put that in slack? I thought I did put it in there. Now

866
01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:09.909
Anthony Taylor: I'm sorry I gave it to you guys, but I didn't put it in the

867
01:23:10.150 --> 01:23:12.710
Anthony Taylor: in slack. I apologize.

868
01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:15.960
Anthony Taylor: It is there now.

869
01:23:16.270 --> 01:23:18.710
Anthony Taylor: select d type.

870
01:23:19.210 --> 01:23:20.150
Raugewitz, Tania: Df.

871
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:33.709
Anthony Taylor: so one more time. What this does data frame. This method will allow us to select

872
01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:39.669
Anthony Taylor: the select the columns where the data type is some number.

873
01:23:40.410 --> 01:23:44.199
Anthony Taylor: And then we're gonna say, and then give me the mean for each one of those.

874
01:23:49.460 --> 01:23:52.620
Anthony Taylor: And if we look at our data thing, like most of the columns, are actually

875
01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:03.690
Anthony Taylor: pretty good, are we? Good? Okay, alright. And then we did the rename.

876
01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:11.079
Anthony Taylor: the same kind of rename as we did. I'm sorry this isn't. We're actually just selecting those columns. We didn't need to do a rename

877
01:24:11.210 --> 01:24:13.690
Anthony Taylor: that were less than what

878
01:24:15.010 --> 01:24:20.710
Anthony Taylor: alright. And then we're outputting it. So that was step 2.

879
01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:25.660
Anthony Taylor: So which is good cause. Step 3. We wouldn't have time to go through, so let's do it.

880
01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:33.169
Anthony Taylor: And if you haven't figured it out yet. the answer to step one and step 2. We're in step 3.

881
01:24:34.930 --> 01:24:40.520
Anthony Taylor: If you would just go here you'd see there's the entire answer for step one and 2. Alright.

882
01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:44.000
Anthony Taylor: That's a secret. I don't tell you until the end.

883
01:24:45.530 --> 01:24:53.110
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So everything here is exactly the same. And now we're here. Okay.

884
01:24:55.140 --> 01:25:01.860
Anthony Taylor: So let me make sure this is not gonna have any big surprises. Pretty sure we're good.

885
01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:15.320
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So this says, create a variable for each country. This is day one python.

886
01:25:15.810 --> 01:25:22.960
Anthony Taylor: Okay, country, one equals something, country 2 equals something. These are countries that you see up here.

887
01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:32.380
Anthony Taylor:  does it tell you which ones we're gonna chart? It does. These are the 3 countries that you need to create a variable for.

888
01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:47.750
Anthony Taylor: Okay. U.S.A. Thailand, Philippines set type of travel companion. so it says, create 3 variables for each country created variable for the type of traveling companion to compare.

889
01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:56.119
Anthony Taylor:  So the Travel companion is in the column names.

890
01:25:56.860 --> 01:26:05.310
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So you can pick spouse children. Whatever you want. And in the solution, it's with spouse. Okay.

891
01:26:06.890 --> 01:26:11.719
Anthony Taylor: once you have that. you want to.

892
01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:16.279
Anthony Taylor:  you're going to create 3 series.

893
01:26:16.830 --> 01:26:24.919
Anthony Taylor: These are going to become your lines. The first series can be country one traveler overtime, or whatever

894
01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:30.060
Anthony Taylor: you're gonna use the the last data frame we made. So

895
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:33.699
Anthony Taylor: this one do a dot loaf

896
01:26:34.130 --> 01:26:36.929
Anthony Taylor: on your country variable.

897
01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:41.820
Anthony Taylor: and then what you need is for the columns.

898
01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:45.950
Anthony Taylor: You know what I'm gonna give you. The first one. Let you guys figure out the next 2.

899
01:26:46.050 --> 01:26:48.060
Anthony Taylor: You gotta write this 3 times.

900
01:26:48.410 --> 01:26:50.730
Anthony Taylor: So here's the first one.

901
01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:57.569
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so you're taking the data frame up above using Loke

902
01:26:57.930 --> 01:27:09.920
Anthony Taylor: putting in the country one variable you're going to make right here. and then you're going to pull the column for 2,01617 and 18, the one with spouse.

903
01:27:10.210 --> 01:27:15.040
Anthony Taylor: or whatever you put here in this variable. Okay? And again.

904
01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:23.890
Anthony Taylor: 2,016, with spouse 2,016 with children, you can do whichever one you know do that. 16 alone.

905
01:27:25.090 --> 01:27:26.100
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

906
01:27:26.130 --> 01:27:30.590
Anthony Taylor: that is a variable. You're gonna put right there columns to compare.

907
01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:31.590
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

908
01:27:31.870 --> 01:27:38.969
Anthony Taylor: So you do this 3 times, one for each of the 3 country variables. Each one needs its own name.

909
01:27:40.410 --> 01:27:41.430
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

910
01:27:42.030 --> 01:27:46.530
Anthony Taylor: next, a list of years. What? 3 years are in our X axis.

911
01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:57.450
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So you're gonna create a list with those 3 years in it. Then you're going to plot your lines alright.

912
01:27:57.970 --> 01:28:02.140
Anthony Taylor: And that's it. Just use plot, dot plot don't even try to get fancy.

913
01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:15.019
Anthony Taylor: Okay. the good news is you have with the years is your X value. And this is your why value? You're just going to put 3 of them in a single plot.

914
01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:17.680
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

915
01:28:18.290 --> 01:28:24.739
Anthony Taylor: everybody good. With that you do not. We're not gonna create handles. So when you do your legend. Just do plot that legend

916
01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:28.490
Anthony Taylor: pretty much it. Okay.

917
01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:34.860
Anthony Taylor: alright questions for us. Send you guys away for 15Â min to work on. This

918
01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:39.150
Anthony Taylor: 50Â min might not be enough, but that's all we got left class. So

919
01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:42.670
Anthony Taylor: I was trying to get you guys out. Oh, yes, I

920
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:52.020
Baro, Sonja: the Y, you said X was going to be the year, and Y was country will be.

921
01:28:52.090 --> 01:28:57.670
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Remember, you're gonna do 3 of these 3 of those right. And they're all one for each variable.

922
01:28:57.930 --> 01:29:00.779
Baro, Sonja: So we're putting them all on the same graph. Yeah.

923
01:29:00.890 --> 01:29:04.399
Anthony Taylor: correct. And you can do all 3 of them in this same cell.

924
01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:11.170
Anthony Taylor: I mean. Honestly, here's the really interesting thing. And if you guys look at this.

925
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:15.140
Anthony Taylor: you don't have to do much to make this into 3 different lines.

926
01:29:16.830 --> 01:29:22.759
Anthony Taylor: Okay, just look at where you have variables, so this one will have to change.

927
01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:27.109
Anthony Taylor: and that will have to change. But this all stays the same.

928
01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:36.160
Anthony Taylor: Thank you. Aye. let you guys give it a try. 15Â min. All right. That's okay.

929
01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:46.989
Anthony Taylor:  So guys, we will figure out what was going on with your screen. II don't know exactly yet, but we'll figure it out.

930
01:29:47.850 --> 01:29:50.090
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So

931
01:29:53.530 --> 01:29:58.849
Anthony Taylor: so we gave you guys all this first stuff. I'm just gonna run all of this because there's only like 2 sales we gotta worry about

932
01:29:59.010 --> 01:30:06.100
Anthony Taylor:  Go down here. Keep all trucking. Oh, and then it died.

933
01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:09.610
Dipinto, Matt: They didn't have the dot D type select.

934
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.079
Anthony Taylor: Oh, yes, you know what? And I think

935
01:30:17.540 --> 01:30:19.260
Baro, Sonja: dropped it into slack.

936
01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:24.979
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, II did fix this in one of them. II gotta go find it.

937
01:30:37.130 --> 01:30:40.410
Anthony Taylor: Is that what you were calling me about, Sonia? I couldn't get there to? Yeah.

938
01:30:41.930 --> 01:30:55.559
Baro, Sonja: no, we had another error. So we got further along, and something was whack in our keys. And so we we were looking, going back, trying to find where it was off on them.

939
01:30:55.790 --> 01:31:01.500
Baro, Sonja: And then we went to the text editor and was trying to find it there. But

940
01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:05.039
Anthony Taylor: that's why I kept pushing the button.

941
01:31:05.410 --> 01:31:19.510
Anthony Taylor: I know, and I kept pushing later, cause you know what it was funny. If if there was more than like 30Â s left I'd have said one of the tas it. But there was no time. Okay, so here's the 3 variables that we talked about

942
01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:22.170
Anthony Taylor: in this case, we're going to do with spouse.

943
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:31.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So looking at what we were showing you before the same data frame from up above. We're gonna search by

944
01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:37.330
Anthony Taylor: in this case, U.S.A., and we're gonna look 2,016 with spouse

945
01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:40.810
Anthony Taylor: alright. So this will give us

946
01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:43.240
Anthony Taylor: 3 separate

947
01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:47.790
Anthony Taylor: filtered data frames with just these 3 columns in it.

948
01:31:48.530 --> 01:31:54.370
Anthony Taylor: Alright. here we're going to create the list. and then we're going to do plot dot plot.

949
01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:59.179
Anthony Taylor: using the list. And each of these

950
01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:01.030
outputs.

951
01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:12.279
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna color them different colors because we don't want them all be the same color with multi line. and then the label will be the value of these labels. So the first one will be U.S.A. The

952
01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:18.929
Anthony Taylor: Thailand and Philippines legend just just plain legend. Best location is great.

953
01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:22.180
Anthony Taylor: They do have a title that's great

954
01:32:22.210 --> 01:32:23.350
Anthony Taylor: years.

955
01:32:23.650 --> 01:32:32.049
Anthony Taylor: For the X ticks on this one, we said, give me the men years and the Max years plus one move, one at a time. That means we're going to get what

956
01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:34.990
Anthony Taylor: 2,016, 2,017, 2,018

957
01:32:35.770 --> 01:32:38.219
and then a Y label and then show.

958
01:32:38.510 --> 01:32:39.949
Anthony Taylor: And it looks like that.

959
01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:44.130
Anthony Taylor:  the

960
01:32:45.890 --> 01:32:50.750
Anthony Taylor: was. Gonna say, there was one thing I was thinking when I said that that you could do differently.

961
01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:54.899
Anthony Taylor: Well, well, this is actually pretty good.

962
01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:57.590
Anthony Taylor: So there's that.

963
01:32:59.460 --> 01:33:00.910
Anthony Taylor: So

964
01:33:02.130 --> 01:33:05.369
Anthony Taylor: I know at least 2 groups had some kind of issue.

965
01:33:06.490 --> 01:33:07.660
Anthony Taylor: right?

966
01:33:08.630 --> 01:33:12.329
Anthony Taylor: So here's what we'll do. I won't make everybody stay unless you want to.

967
01:33:12.490 --> 01:33:22.409
Anthony Taylor: I'll keep recording, but we'll go on and let if if you guys are good with this. you can go. If you want to stay and see the troubles meeting, we're gonna do right now

968
01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:25.210
Anthony Taylor: stick around. Okay.

969
01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:33.789
Anthony Taylor: So I guess II was working with Tanya. But I mean, sounds like, you guys might be a little further, Sonya. So what what do you have?

970
01:33:34.110 --> 01:33:40.340
Baro, Sonja: I actually think, well, we'll see. I'm gonna press the button and see if this fix it. No, it didn't fix it.

971
01:33:41.210 --> 01:33:48.089
Baro, Sonja: Okay? Well, so now I have a different no, okay. hang on, let me share.

972
01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:56.239
Baro, Sonja: But mine is now off, because I thought I had found the error. Gabe, are you still with us? Do you mind sharing?

973
01:33:57.100 --> 01:33:59.830
Vasquez, Gabriel: Yeah, II could share. Oh, good. You still here?

974
01:33:59.850 --> 01:34:01.449
Baro, Sonja: Yeah, yeah, thank you.

975
01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:08.689
Baro, Sonja: Cause I thought it was because we were trying to to query on different, oh, see? He fixed it too. Yeah.

976
01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:10.360
Baro, Sonja: Okay.

977
01:34:10.930 --> 01:34:21.209
Baro, Sonja: So this is where we were having troubles. Go we were. We were setting the trying to do the what's the key? Is the key, or the alone, or the

978
01:34:21.310 --> 01:34:24.170
Baro, Sonja: no, none of index

979
01:34:25.260 --> 01:34:28.420
Anthony Taylor: country of nationality. Singapore blah, blah! Blah!

980
01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:38.650
Anthony Taylor:  That is interesting. Scroll up. Let me see your variables.

981
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:41.150
Jennifer Dahlgren: I think alone is capitalized.

982
01:34:43.150 --> 01:34:47.939
Jennifer Dahlgren: No? Well, the word is yeah, but not the

983
01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:50.920
Baro, Sonja: right.

984
01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:59.660
Anthony Taylor: It looks like your data frame is wrong. Can you just do me a favor like, try open a cell and just show me travel reduced.

985
01:35:02.670 --> 01:35:07.530
Anthony Taylor: I mean it should be that one right there you should be able to run that one and just show me but you could do it. There.

986
01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:11.300
Jennifer Dahlgren: Hmm!

987
01:35:16.450 --> 01:35:18.150
Anthony Taylor: That looks good.

988
01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:21.290
Anthony Taylor: So

989
01:35:22.410 --> 01:35:24.380
Anthony Taylor: nice.

990
01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:30.220
Anthony Taylor: well, that's there. Hmm!

991
01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:42.050
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Why is it filling Singapore? Because your 2, your 3 countries you identified were U.S.A. Thailand and Philippines.

992
01:35:42.910 --> 01:35:46.660
Jennifer Dahlgren: Well, it looks like it's returning the whole column

993
01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:55.089
Anthony Taylor: instead of like the individual, like the 3 columns like. If you look there, see none of index. 2,016 country of nationality.

994
01:35:55.550 --> 01:35:58.749
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Singapore, 18, Thailand 30, I mean, that's like

995
01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:00.980
Anthony Taylor: whole bunch of weird stuff.

996
01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:06.540
Meredith McCanse (she/her): maybe. Yeah.

997
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:11.439
Baro, Sonja: Restart. Okay.

998
01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:19.530
Anthony Taylor: Oh, is that gonna work? Oh, no, that was that one.

999
01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:22.580
Anthony Taylor: Look at that. Stop there.

1000
01:36:23.020 --> 01:36:28.889
Anthony Taylor: that's all it was. That isn't that awful?

1001
01:36:29.020 --> 01:36:33.989
Baro, Sonja: But I will tell you guys, and this is a real debugging technique. Okay.

1002
01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:42.550
Anthony Taylor: if you start seeing something that just doesn't make any sense and at least try that. it usually isn't gonna hurt anything.

1003
01:36:42.990 --> 01:36:44.809
Anthony Taylor: And and

1004
01:36:45.250 --> 01:36:46.030
Anthony Taylor: yeah.

1005
01:36:46.870 --> 01:36:50.260
Anthony Taylor: so yeah, just trying. That is all it took. And you got.

1006
01:36:50.510 --> 01:36:51.540
Anthony Taylor: So

1007
01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:56.099
Anthony Taylor: let's look at Tanya's real quick now, cause I think you're on the right path.

1008
01:36:56.620 --> 01:37:00.420
Anthony Taylor: and I know Tanya's had some weird stuff going on. So let's see what she's got.

1009
01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:02.060
Raugewitz, Tania: See?

1010
01:37:03.490 --> 01:37:11.710
Anthony Taylor: It's your step one, Mike. That's not always right. Yeah, here, I can see your desktop.

1011
01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:13.780
Raugewitz, Tania: Add the wrong screen. Now.

1012
01:37:29.090 --> 01:37:30.689
Raugewitz, Tania: So this is where we were.

1013
01:37:31.670 --> 01:37:36.170
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Yeah. So you have another interesting situation. So

1014
01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:39.170
Anthony Taylor: oh, wait!

1015
01:37:39.310 --> 01:37:43.699
Anthony Taylor: Go up to your variables up there. Oh, wait, wait, wait! Wait! I changed that.

1016
01:37:48.990 --> 01:37:55.050
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But the one above that, that one should just be U.S.A., not

1017
01:37:55.230 --> 01:38:04.479
Anthony Taylor: not data. So I take just for right now, just take the first one and just make U.S.A. equals string U.S.A.,

1018
01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:06.720
Jennifer Dahlgren:  okay.

1019
01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:18.899
Anthony Taylor: yeah, you're not, you're not gonna filter right there. You're trying to filter it. Yeah, there you go. Give me that bracket, just run that cell and then run the 3 down, or that one and the next one.

1020
01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:27.810
Anthony Taylor: And let's see, Aha didn't fail. Okay, so now do that with the other 2, and you can uncommon. I think your business.

1021
01:38:27.950 --> 01:38:28.740
Raugewitz, Tania: Okay?

1022
01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:30.740
Anthony Taylor: Yup, that wasn't too bad.

1023
01:38:32.150 --> 01:38:35.260
Anthony Taylor: Any other recorded questions, Rodney.

1024
01:38:36.110 --> 01:38:38.970
Masarirambi, Rodney: So we just tried to do the most with the ones

1025
01:38:39.110 --> 01:38:46.420
Masarirambi, Rodney: like we're trying to do like a bunch of different things. Okay, yeah.

1026
01:38:47.150 --> 01:38:58.419
Anthony Taylor: the cool thing about this is is that, yeah, this is using variables like this. And then this one block of code. You can just change the variables and and make things happen. So

1027
01:38:59.790 --> 01:39:00.989
Anthony Taylor: alright, I'm gonna stop the recording.
