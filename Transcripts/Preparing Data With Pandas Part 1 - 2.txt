00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.639
Baro, Sonja: How do I take this wonderful thing and turn it into something

2
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.860
michael mcpherson: disturbing? Well, there you go now, like

3
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.510
michael mcpherson: little Peter Cottontail. Wow. okay.

4
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.720
Baro, Sonja: I don't know if we get started today, guys, I have, Michael.

5
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.339
Anthony Taylor: I have a surprise for all of you. Your thoughts go through my head all the time

6
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:40.570
Anthony Taylor: I have a surprise for me to give you this surprise. I will need your email addresses. So slack them to me if you haven't already today.

7
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.180
Anthony Taylor: And

8
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.289
Anthony Taylor: I will show you what your surprise is. Actually, some of you already have some of you that were in office hours already. Did it?

9
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.660
Anthony Taylor:  And actually, you know what

10
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.669
Anthony Taylor: I'll I think I think what I'll do is I'll wait

11
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:09.709
Anthony Taylor: and then show it to you after break, because that'll give me time to invite everybody. But basically, I mean, I'll give you a very high level.  you are going to be receiving

12
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.090
Anthony Taylor: a a subscription

13
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.040
Anthony Taylor: to Datacamp.

14
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:30.460
Anthony Taylor: which is a very cool product. I've been able to get this for every class that I've had so far. and

15
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:39.459
Anthony Taylor: it's it's an amazing assistant to what we're doing here or like. You know, it's just very cool.

16
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:47.399
Anthony Taylor: That's very cool. Don't want you guys to look at it during class. but I am going to send you invitations like right now.

17
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:56.260
Anthony Taylor: so that you have them, and then, after break, we'll quickly jump in here and I'll show you guys the best way to use it

18
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:06.480
Anthony Taylor: almost got everybody. There's not a very big class, so I will, though, Brandon. Just so, you know, mister, gonna be the head of the leaderboard.

19
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:16.140
Anthony Taylor:  I might be sharing this with some other classes this time, because I can actually have an unlimited number of of people in me.

20
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.270
michael mcpherson: So, Adam, what leader board?

21
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.580
Anthony Taylor: Alright, I will show you the leaderboard. Really quick.

22
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.800
Anthony Taylor: Let me let me get Matt.

23
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:31.519
I didn't know.

24
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.759
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so now we know we've got somebody else interested in the leaderboard.

25
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.689
Anthony Taylor: All I had to say was, There's a leaderboard, and like I'm in. No, there was one.

26
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.310
Anthony Taylor: Well, you will. Now.

27
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:45.890
Anthony Taylor: alright.

28
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:54.489
Anthony Taylor: Okay, good. Alright. Everybody got their invite, or everyone will have an invite in a minute.  just real quick.

29
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.949
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna show you how is how to do this. But while you're doing this, you get experience every time you do something.

30
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.849
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And

31
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.500
Anthony Taylor: there there is. It is surely just for fun. A leaderboard

32
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:20.680
Anthony Taylor: that keeps track. Oh, and, Brandon, if I see your experience, go up while I'm teaching class. I will block you.

33
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:38.330
Anthony Taylor: So Brandon's already up to 1,000 experience since office hours started. Okay, at Clayton's. Got a little bit and all that. So basically.

34
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:45.980
Anthony Taylor: what should happen is when you're not in class as you do. Work. Experience will, will, you know, gain up, and

35
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.409
Anthony Taylor: you can get on the leaderboard. But it's not. This is not a competition. It's not. It's that's just a fun thing

36
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.509
Anthony Taylor: that they added to it. Anyway. Again, I will show that after break I wanted to get everybody

37
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.879
Anthony Taylor: their invitation a. But, Mike, did you just now send me your email?

38
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.670
Anthony Taylor: Okay, hold on. I didn't send one. I was. I had to re clone my

39
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:12.570
michael mcpherson: stuff.

40
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.529
Anthony Taylor: I just wanna II just I didn't wanna not invite you.

41
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.490
michael mcpherson: It's a religious one, too.

42
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.139
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. II think I might have everybody now, actually, oh, no, I have to

43
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.700
michael mcpherson: now

44
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.800
Anthony Taylor: and more

45
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.129
Anthony Taylor: and again. Don't play with it right now. Play within a little bit.

46
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:53.679
Anthony Taylor: and I'll show you how to do or how to use it effectively later today. but that will allow

47
00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:02.670
Anthony Taylor: this should get make sure everybody has it before break. And then. okay. hi. so

48
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.340
Anthony Taylor: Panda's day 2. Here we go.

49
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.979
Anthony Taylor:  Lots of fun stuff.

50
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.790
Anthony Taylor: Oh, you put it there. Good.

51
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.480
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

52
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.059
Anthony Taylor: I'm still here in Florida. So I'm just organized. There we go.

53
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:41.230
Anthony Taylor: what are we gonna cover today? Lots of fun stuff we're gonna learn. So we're going back to data frames. Remember, we learned data frames on Monday using pandas. We're gonna work with them

54
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:54.309
Anthony Taylor: all day today. We're probably actually, we're gonna start you with a little quick review. But first let's talk about what we're gonna do here in class. So today, we're going to learn how to sort our data in a data frame which can be very helpful.

55
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.349
Anthony Taylor: We're going to learn to do summary statistics. So one of the first things we need to do

56
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.930
Anthony Taylor: is

57
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:16.710
Anthony Taylor: One of the first things we need to do is be able to explain our data. And this is, you know, when we're doing data analytics, when we're doing data science. when we're doing AI with data.

58
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:23.350
Anthony Taylor: We need to be able to understand our data. So the the whole point of this Pandas

59
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:29.800
Anthony Taylor: trip that we're taking is so that we can get better at understanding our data.

60
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.189
Anthony Taylor: So summary statistics is incredibly important.

61
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.390
Anthony Taylor: It allows us to just basically very quickly

62
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:42.200
Anthony Taylor: take a look at our data and see. You know where? Where we at. What do we got?

63
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:49.370
Anthony Taylor: Okay? We're going to utilize some statistical functions. Here's my statistics. People in here. I know I got some.

64
00:06:51.720 --> 00:07:00.280
Anthony Taylor: Oh, Jennifer Mike, okay, Meredith, okay, so we're going to be talking about a few very simple statistics

65
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.860
Anthony Taylor: today. So that'll be fun. And yeah.

66
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.249
Anthony Taylor: alright. So that's what we're gonna do today.

67
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.279
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna start right away with an activity.

68
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:38.599
Anthony Taylor: Okay. here's the activity you're going to read in a Csv file display the first 5 rows. How do you do that? What? What method does that

69
00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:41.900
Meredith McCanse (she/her): head, Ed.

70
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.809
Anthony Taylor: I'll rename rename the columns.

71
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:54.509
Anthony Taylor: They all should be lower case underscores instead of spaces. Thank God. and rename this one to hourly, Tim.

72
00:07:54.910 --> 00:08:03.189
Anthony Taylor: And then you're gonna answer these questions. So you're gonna have to figure out how many reports have this? So how do we filter a data frame? What's the

73
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.530
Anthony Taylor: best way to filter a data frame?

74
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:07.790
Baro, Sonja: Locke?

75
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:12.680
Anthony Taylor: Exactly a little. CD Luke Rock, whichever you wanna call

76
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.090
Baro, Sonja: smoking. Yeah.

77
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.229
Anthony Taylor: yeah, I always say, I'd say low, cause I'm thinking, locate

78
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.960
Anthony Taylor: how many read. So you're gonna filter and then get the count

79
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.680
Anthony Taylor: filter and get the count.

80
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.629
Anthony Taylor: What is the temperature? Now this is, I want you guys to think

81
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:42.390
Anthony Taylor: when you do this one. they are asking you to use. Eyelope, I'll give you a hint. Alright. and then the same here. okay, and then

82
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:50.499
Anthony Taylor: show 10 rows. So that's it. We're just gonna spend 10 min doing this just to kind of get you guys head back on the data frame thing.

83
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:54.279
Anthony Taylor: And that's it. So let me get you guys set up.

84
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.490
Anthony Taylor: Boom. how did we do?

85
00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:02.660
Anthony Taylor: Are you okay?

86
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:14.509
Meredith McCanse (she/her): The awesome. We just didn't get through all of them. But we like knew what to do, and it was great, and we talked about it and all those things. But we only got through like the first

87
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:20.169
Anthony Taylor: 3 or 4 steps real quick. So we import pandas.

88
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:29.330
Anthony Taylor: Reading in the file was read, Csv. Looking at the top 5 rows we're still waiting for.

89
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.359
Anthony Taylor: Come on

90
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:45.729
for the rename. We use the data frame dot rename.

91
00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.469
Anthony Taylor: What do we want to rename columns?

92
00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:57.109
Anthony Taylor: Then a dictionary object with the key is the old name, and the value is the new name.

93
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:09.570
Anthony Taylor: and we can take a look work. How many reports? So here we're doing the loc. We're gonna do a filter on FM. 16,

94
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:18.369
Anthony Taylor: and I'll put that to here, and then you can do length, and you will get how many there are? 510. Is that what everybody got who got that one done?

95
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.680
Anthony Taylor: 5, 10 good.

96
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:28.070
Anthony Taylor: then over 70. So again, we're using Loke hourly. Temp greater than 70. Get the length.

97
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:30.960
Anthony Taylor: 96.

98
00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.289
Anthony Taylor: Anybody get something different?

99
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.149
Anthony Taylor: Oh, Curry looks like he got something different, or he's doing something. Not that we're doing.

100
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.200
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, okay, good.

101
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:52.990
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Now, here's the the tricky one said, what was the 270 sixth reading

102
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:55.890
Anthony Taylor: who did? 276

103
00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.620
Anthony Taylor: right here?

104
00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.659
Anthony Taylor: Did anybody get to this one?

105
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:10.830
Anthony Taylor: You should have done 275, and you would have got the reading of 61. Anybody get to that one?

106
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.030
Anthony Taylor: Then

107
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:24.760
Meredith McCanse (she/her): question on something like this. Is it, asking of like of the filtered list that we've whittled it down to? Or is it asking about the original population?

108
00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:27.570
Anthony Taylor: And it wanted the hourly temp. So

109
00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:29.580
Anthony Taylor: 0 1, 2, 3,

110
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:34.159
Anthony Taylor: but it went at the 276 reading so

111
00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:40.860
Anthony Taylor: what else? So here it said. What were the dates

112
00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:46.590
Anthony Taylor: and report types of the rows. 500 through 505.

113
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:53.800
Anthony Taylor: So here we do, Ilo. 500 to 5 6. And we want row or columns one and do.

114
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.810
Anthony Taylor: And we get website.

115
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:10.389
Anthony Taylor: show the last 10 and or yeah, and there's 2 ways to do it. You can do tail 10, or you can do. I, Loke, minus 10. Show me all columns.

116
00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.839
Anthony Taylor: and you see the end of the data.

117
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:20.919
Anthony Taylor: Any questions about that. As long as you understood everything I just showed you. You're okay.

118
00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:27.119
Anthony Taylor: Okay doesn't matter that you didn't get it in the 10 min. What matters is is that you understand what I'm showing

119
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.469
Anthony Taylor: alright, more or less. Everybody there.

120
00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:35.080
Anthony Taylor: Okay, good. So let's

121
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:36.430
continue.

122
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.700
Anthony Taylor: So here.

123
00:12:49.890 --> 00:13:06.339
Anthony Taylor: Again, remember, the the theme of today is is that we need to start understanding our data. So let's see, I mean, you know, talking about what we've learned so far with Pandas in particular, I mean, understand? You can't learn pandas until you know python. So we started with python.

124
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:13.150
Anthony Taylor: We now know how to import packages, and we imported pandas. Now that we know how to get pandas.

125
00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.820
Anthony Taylor: We're able to start

126
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.940
Anthony Taylor: trying to analyze

127
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:20.679
Anthony Taylor: our data.

128
00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:26.540
Anthony Taylor: Things that we want to do. Yeah. I mean, it's then the first step of that

129
00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:33.360
Anthony Taylor: it isn't always sorting. But it is important to understand that you may want to sort. Okay.

130
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:43.629
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to start with importing pandas and importing some data. We do this every time we use pandas. So this shouldn't be a big deal.

131
00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:49.460
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Now, just looking at our data, let's just eyeball our data for a second here.

132
00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:56.109
Anthony Taylor: So what do we got? We got town meal, meal, count rent, rent, count alcohol, apple account, past meals.

133
00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:08.810
Anthony Taylor: past meal counts past rent rent past count past alcohol, past alcohol, count. I don't know what this is. What is it? What's it called tax statistics in Vermont. Okay, I guess. Okay.

134
00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.560
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So

135
00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:16.040
Anthony Taylor: first thing we're going to do is we're going to sort on the meals

136
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:22.490
Anthony Taylor: column. Okay? And we want to sort from a highest

137
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:26.330
Anthony Taylor: to low are from lowest to highest.

138
00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:34.969
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so that is. And and and let's do this. I love this because I actually to this day I have to like

139
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.019
Anthony Taylor: mentally stop and think about. This

140
00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:40.150
Anthony Taylor: question

141
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:44.619
Anthony Taylor: is lowest to highest ascending or descending.

142
00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.530
Anthony Taylor: How many say, descending? Raise your hand

143
00:14:50.570 --> 00:15:02.029
Anthony Taylor: ascending it says that sending. See? I'm the dumb one in the room. Then, because I still stop and go. Is that upstairs or downstairs? If you're at the bottom looking up?

144
00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:03.080
Anthony Taylor: Yep.

145
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:15.829
Anthony Taylor: that that's basically what I do now is I'm like, so, Anthony, when you want to make the room cooler, do you turn up the air conditioning or turn it down.

146
00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:24.439
Anthony Taylor: That's a good question. You turn down the temperature. But up there.

147
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:29.830
Anthony Taylor: look at Curry's dog. That's the damn cutest thing I've seen today.

148
00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:36.400
Anthony Taylor: I miss my dogs. Okay? So

149
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:45.860
Anthony Taylor: we're going to run this. And by default, the sort values method of a data frame

150
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:49.290
Anthony Taylor: will sort in ascending order.

151
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:57.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So when we look at meals we'll see. It starts low and well, eventually we'll get to high.

152
00:15:58.450 --> 00:15:59.500
Anthony Taylor: Aye.

153
00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:07.319
Anthony Taylor: if we wanted to do descending. You don't say or write descending.

154
00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:12.280
Anthony Taylor: What you will write is us ending equals false.

155
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:20.319
Anthony Taylor: So what does that tell me? Well, that tells me that the data frame sort values method

156
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:26.680
Anthony Taylor: has an argument called ascending that defaults to turn

157
00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.440
Anthony Taylor: so without writing anything, it'll just be true.

158
00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:39.100
Anthony Taylor: But if I don't want it to be true, I need to specifically tell it to be false. Okay, so this will switch that order.

159
00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:47.079
Anthony Taylor: so that now the largest numbers are at the top and they will descend to 0.

160
00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:54.220
Anthony Taylor: Okay. now, sort values doesn't stop with a single column.

161
00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:59.680
Anthony Taylor: We can actually, we can sort a data frame across multiple columns.

162
00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:08.560
Anthony Taylor: same number of arguments. But since we have multiple columns, we need to put the multiple columns into a list.

163
00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.000
Anthony Taylor: A list is surrounded by square brackets.

164
00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:15.670
Anthony Taylor: So data frame

165
00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:19.790
Anthony Taylor: sort values parentheses.

166
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:28.199
Anthony Taylor: Our first argument is the columns we want to sort. And in this case, since there's more than one, we're going to wrap it in square brackets.

167
00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:39.969
Anthony Taylor: it will sort in the order of the columns presented. So it will sort meals, count first. and if they are in fact the same.

168
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:43.190
Anthony Taylor: it will then sort on rent. Count

169
00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:51.969
Anthony Taylor: so like. If you have 2 rows with the same meal, count, then rent, count will be the second one we're doing ascending false, which means descending.

170
00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:56.100
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna look at 15 rows. And there's a reason I'll show you.

171
00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:02.989
Anthony Taylor: And the reason we're looking at 15 rows is, see meals count. It doesn't duplicate until here.

172
00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.399
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so, and then here we can see rent count.

173
00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:13.340
Anthony Taylor: So since meal count was the same, the next sort would be rent count.

174
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.070
Anthony Taylor: Got it? I mean, that's

175
00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.650
Anthony Taylor: pretty normal sorting. right?

176
00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.620
Anthony Taylor: What else do we have here?

177
00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:37.470
Anthony Taylor: Oh, this one. And and and okay, they're gonna show you the exact same thing. But for alcohol count, for some reason, I'm not sure. So same one.

178
00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:41.620
Anthony Taylor: Here's the 2, and alcohol count is

179
00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:48.820
Anthony Taylor: here, and you can see 25 was first and then 16. So think. okay.

180
00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.329
Anthony Taylor: alright. Now, here's the thing.

181
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.500
Anthony Taylor: So notice on each one of these. We're setting

182
00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:06.750
Anthony Taylor: the data frame equal to a new data frame. If you just do data frame sort values and pick a column, it'll only it'll display it.

183
00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:10.570
Anthony Taylor: But it won't stay that way. You have to save it.

184
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:18.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay. The other thing that maybe you guys noticed or didn't notice. Look at the index column right here

185
00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:26.099
Anthony Taylor: this column. Remember this index column. Check it out. The numbers are whack.

186
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:32.029
Anthony Taylor: And the reason is is, those are the indexes of the row. When we made the data frame.

187
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.120
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that may not be what we want.

188
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:44.050
Anthony Taylor: When we're done. So like, say, we've decided we're done sorting this data frame. But now the indexes are all off.

189
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.689
Anthony Taylor: so we can say.

190
00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:51.070
Anthony Taylor:  take the data frame and reset

191
00:19:51.280 --> 00:20:04.480
Anthony Taylor: the index. and then there is an argument. and the argument is, or a parameter drop equals. True. what that means is, if you don't say drop equals. True.

192
00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:08.679
Anthony Taylor: it will create a new column for the index.

193
00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:15.779
Anthony Taylor: but this one will become an actual column. In fact, let's just let me just show you what that looks like. Once

194
00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:26.359
Anthony Taylor: I'm just going to delete this drop equals true. and then run that cell and see. So now you see, there's a column called Index.

195
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:32.820
Anthony Taylor: And look, it's the numbers from up above. But now there's a new index

196
00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:39.949
Anthony Taylor: right? It's rare you would want this, but if for some reason you needed to keep the original order.

197
00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:43.089
Anthony Taylor: then you could use this for that. But if we

198
00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:46.160
Anthony Taylor: put drop equals true back in here.

199
00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:51.330
Anthony Taylor: it'll basically just reset it without that index column.

200
00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:53.420
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

201
00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:55.800
Anthony Taylor: So our values

202
00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:04.300
Derek Rikke: can you sort if you're sorted by 2 categories. Can you sort one ascending and descending?

203
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:10.260
Anthony Taylor: No, unfortunately not. You have to it that each sort value has to have that

204
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:19.010
Anthony Taylor: decided on. so you could sort save it, and then sort on the next one. you know, in the opposite order, or what have you?

205
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:23.670
Anthony Taylor: But you can change the ascending or descending in a single call.

206
00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:38.690
Meredith McCanse (she/her): It would mess up your data relationships if you tried to do that like, you want to preserve their relationship across the row, and if you had one column going ascending another column going descending, you would all your data would get skewed.

207
00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:43.549
Anthony Taylor: Well, but, like what he was just saying like, for instance, on this 54

208
00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:52.059
Anthony Taylor: right? We see that 54, 54 that was the first column, 2,516 was second. Well, what if you wanted this one descending?

209
00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:58.820
Meredith McCanse (she/her): It would just be 1,625, and it can be done. But it's not

210
00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:04.810
Anthony Taylor: with a single call. Okay, at least a single sort. Values call.

211
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:09.889
Anthony Taylor: Okay? You could probably chain it. There's other ways. You could do it.

212
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.660
Anthony Taylor: Big, great assistant question.

213
00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:16.460
Anthony Taylor:  okay, alright, but we're not done yet.

214
00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.479
Anthony Taylor: He thought I was gonna send you away. I know you. but we are.

215
00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:24.950
Anthony Taylor: So again, remember, our primary goal

216
00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:30.210
Anthony Taylor: is to get to the point where we're exploring and understanding our data.

217
00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:34.880
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so we're gonna import pandas.

218
00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:36.420
Anthony Taylor: select kernel.

219
00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:43.970
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna import our data. We're going to redefine. So got that.

220
00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.189
Anthony Taylor: So first thing we're gonna do

221
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.939
Anthony Taylor: is to a quick look at our data. And this is very common.

222
00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:58.059
Anthony Taylor: If you don't know your data. The first thing you want to do is do it like a hit.

223
00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:03.009
Anthony Taylor: so that you can get an idea of what. And and even if it just pulled correctly.

224
00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:10.539
Anthony Taylor: it might be. You've looked at the file, and then, you know, you get here and you look at the head, and it's wrong, like the columns are messed up or something.

225
00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:19.650
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we can look at this. And we're going okay. So we have a name column employer, City state Zip.

226
00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.969
Anthony Taylor: that Zip's interesting

227
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:27.150
Anthony Taylor: now, and memo, CD, well, look at that. So in a in

228
00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:35.030
Anthony Taylor: in python, or in a Panda's data frame in a N means

229
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.940
Anthony Taylor: not a number.

230
00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:44.170
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now is name and number new, but there's a value there.

231
00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:51.640
Anthony Taylor: So when you see man. that means it's null, it's empty. We don't know what value goes there.

232
00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:58.309
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, if it was just empty, is that the same as Nan?

233
00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:07.790
Anthony Taylor: No. okay. Cause empty. If I was to type empty.

234
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:11.569
Anthony Taylor: It would look like that 2 quotes.

235
00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:16.159
Anthony Taylor: or it's empty, but it is a string. It's just an empty string.

236
00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.190
A null

237
00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:19.340
Anthony Taylor: is nothing.

238
00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:23.899
Anthony Taylor: So when you see an A N, it literally means there's nothing there.

239
00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:33.050
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So keep that in mind. So that's just basically trash. So since it's trash, we're gonna use delete

240
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:37.789
Anthony Taylor: the data frame and then the column we want to delete.

241
00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:43.200
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now we can look at our data again, and you'll see that column is gone.

242
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:50.270
Anthony Taylor: To get a count. Now this is an interesting count.

243
00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:54.070
Anthony Taylor: It's giving it to us by column.

244
00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.610
Anthony Taylor: Yes, Ana.

245
00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:01.479
Baro, Sonja: how come on that one when you make a change it.

246
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.829
Baro, Sonja: Is it kept?

247
00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:07.970
Baro, Sonja: Case delete will stay. Delete is a delete.

248
00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:15.979
Baro, Sonja: Okay, versus other changes. If we don't rename it and save it, we lose that change.

249
00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:17.140
Okay.

250
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:20.880
Anthony Taylor: so. Count.

251
00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:27.149
Anthony Taylor: you would think that would just give you the count right of the whole data frame. But no, it gives us the count of each

252
00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:28.660
Anthony Taylor: column.

253
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:34.300
Anthony Taylor: Now, why would each column potentially have

254
00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.170
Anthony Taylor: different counts

255
00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:39.640
Dipinto, Matt: data in those columns?

256
00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:41.820
Anthony Taylor: What was that meant?

257
00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:44.690
Dipinto, Matt: But there's no data in those columns. Yeah.

258
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:52.809
Anthony Taylor: right? So what this is basically telling us is that there's 2,000 names. That's probably all of them. Okay.

259
00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:56.349
Anthony Taylor: but 1,820 of them

260
00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:03.500
Anthony Taylor: all have employers. So that means what we've got. Like 180 rows that have a null employer.

261
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:10.269
Anthony Taylor: One has a null city, no State 4 have a null zip.

262
00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:12.970
Anthony Taylor: So

263
00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:19.049
Anthony Taylor: that's information we want to know, we're missing some employer data. Well, depending on what we're doing

264
00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.390
Anthony Taylor: with this data, that employer data might be important.

265
00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:30.499
Anthony Taylor: So we have a couple of options, one of which is, you know what? I don't want any rows that don't have something in the employer column.

266
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:36.360
Anthony Taylor: So to get rid of those very quickly. we can say.

267
00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:41.610
Anthony Taylor: dia, the data frame dot new method drop in a

268
00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:43.960
Anthony Taylor: okay

269
00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:49.040
Anthony Taylor: and then and and I gotta. I gotta tell you guys, you will almost

270
00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:50.690
Anthony Taylor: never

271
00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:54.630
Anthony Taylor: use this because this is literally just gonna drop

272
00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:58.460
Anthony Taylor: any row that has a null in it anywhere.

273
00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:03.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay, in fact. Well, here. So let's let's run this

274
00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:10.700
Anthony Taylor: and run the count again. And then I want to ask you guys see how well, you understand something. So now all of them

275
00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:16.900
Anthony Taylor: had the same number because they all had nulls. Now this is all the data where none of the columns have a null.

276
00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:19.659
Anthony Taylor: So what would happen

277
00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:25.980
Anthony Taylor: if I would have ran that here for the delete?

278
00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:32.870
Dipinto, Matt: You would you would lose everything.

279
00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:36.639
Anthony Taylor: We would have deleted everything that would have been a disaster.

280
00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:50.920
Anthony Taylor: right? So drop in a how equals. Annie is very rarely used. I have had, and I have a situation right now where I use drop in a how equals all

281
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:55.529
Anthony Taylor: you know. It all might be what you think that might be

282
00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.610
Jennifer Dahlgren: like. The row is gone.

283
00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.879
Anthony Taylor: The whole row is just null data. There's nothing in it.

284
00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:08.230
Anthony Taylor: But there's a row. And what happened is is the the incoming file. They it's like

285
00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:19.549
Anthony Taylor: it's got a null between every single row. It's got an empty row between every row, so we pull it in, and then we say, How equals all, and it drops all of those if every column is null

286
00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:22.330
Anthony Taylor: and and it works very, very well.

287
00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:32.540
Meredith McCanse (she/her):  hey, Anthony, I have a question. So you were saying about how that would be disastrous if you lost all of it.

288
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:35.330
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So my question is, if you

289
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:45.979
Meredith McCanse (she/her): like, as you're doing this, and we have our different cells in the python notebook. And let's say you do that and tell it to get rid of all of it. Can't you just like is the original preserved. Can't you just

290
00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:55.210
Anthony Taylor: back out that part of the code and go back to where you were before that? Or is it like a once you do that it's gone. And you're screwed.

291
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:58.569
Anthony Taylor: basically stored in memory while you're using it.

292
00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:07.299
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So all you would have to do is just come back up here and we run the poll. It's not disastrous, is.

293
00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:11.419
Anthony Taylor: I mean, I guess it's a little bit of of an extreme term.

294
00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:20.099
Anthony Taylor: But keeping in mind that, as you. I mean, we do everything in this class. We keep fairly small, and and the reason we keep it small is that

295
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:27.650
Anthony Taylor: there's some of you have laptops that could handle a million rows of data. And some of you have laptops that can handle 1,000 rows of data.

296
00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:29.920
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so

297
00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:40.070
Anthony Taylor: we we have to keep that in mind as well as the fact that, you know we don't want to sit here for 5 min waiting for data to be processed. So we keep everything really small.

298
00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:44.390
Anthony Taylor: So in the real world, when you guys start working.

299
00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:52.050
Anthony Taylor: you know, you might be dealing with millions or hundreds of millions of rows of data. and then it's no fun to have to go reload everything.

300
00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:56.759
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But yes, you are right. You can just go.

301
00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.650
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

302
00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.610
Anthony Taylor: Oh.

303
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:09.549
Anthony Taylor: D types. So what D types does is tell us the data type of each column.

304
00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:18.109
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so you can see here, name is an object. So in canvas. An object is a string.

305
00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:24.990
Okay? So name makes sense employer, object, city object, state object.

306
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.600
Anthony Taylor: zip. float

307
00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.460
Anthony Taylor: amount. Int.

308
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:33.890
Anthony Taylor: So where's Rodney?

309
00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:38.929
Anthony Taylor: I needed Rodney for this question.

310
00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:43.699
Anthony Taylor: all right. Are all zip codes numbers?

311
00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:45.550
michael mcpherson: No.

312
00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:50.050
Anthony Taylor: thank you, Michael. What? What? Zip codes are not numbers

313
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:57.950
michael mcpherson: anything that is British part of the United kingdom or under the the quit. Well, now, can't

314
00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:01.690
michael mcpherson: I know those are

315
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:05.149
Anthony Taylor: not saying stupid Canadian postal codes?

316
00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:17.910
Anthony Taylor: Well, can Canada is part of actually one of my first really big data projects in my career

317
00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:23.040
Anthony Taylor: was converting an environment to be allowed to use postal codes

318
00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:27.760
Anthony Taylor: instead of just it, because all of their databases had zip codes as numbers

319
00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:33.170
Anthony Taylor: right, and and we had a lot of business

320
00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:40.700
Anthony Taylor: coming from Canada, and we couldn't put their postal code in. We couldn't put their zip code in. They don't have zip codes. They're called, anyway.

321
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:43.509
Anthony Taylor: So we need zip code to be a string.

322
00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.000
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So we're going to convert it.

323
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:52.820
Anthony Taylor: Cool thing is fairly easy to do. We do need to set this to a value.

324
00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:56.530
Anthony Taylor: But we're going to do data frame. We're going to use as type.

325
00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:02.250
Anthony Taylor: put in the column. Now notice, this is a dictionary.

326
00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:06.769
Anthony Taylor: I. So the key is the column.

327
00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:10.650
Anthony Taylor: The value is what we want to change.

328
00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:16.920
Anthony Taylor: and then errors is if there's a problem, tell me about it.

329
00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:18.810
Anthony Taylor: That's all.

330
00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:22.460
Anthony Taylor: Okay. There's not going to be a problem converting a number to a string.

331
00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:27.720
Anthony Taylor: And then. That is now done. So now if we just wanna look at the D type

332
00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:31.950
Anthony Taylor: for that column, we can pass that column dot d type

333
00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:41.690
Anthony Taylor: and we'll see it's now an O, but we can also come up here and rerun this. and you'll see it's now an object. Okay.

334
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:49.129
Anthony Taylor: okay, so pretty cool so far, right? What have we learned so far? Let's just quickly review.

335
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:54.880
Anthony Taylor: We learned how to get rid of Null. We learned how to delete a column

336
00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:59.010
Anthony Taylor: de L. We learned how to count

337
00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:08.180
Anthony Taylor: and see all of our column counts. How to drop! If any column is null in our row.

338
00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:12.820
Anthony Taylor: How to see the data types in our data

339
00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:26.340
Anthony Taylor: and how to convert a data type for an entire column. Okay, alright. So now, let's do a unique for my SQL people. This would be the equipment of select distinct.

340
00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:35.899
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to say, show me the unique employers in my data. And what what data type is this

341
00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:42.120
Derek Rikke: string?

342
00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:46.119
Anthony Taylor: It is the the individual ones are string. What about the whole return?

343
00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:50.199
Anthony Taylor: A list? It is a list. Absolutely.

344
00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:58.569
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So here's all the different employers. And notice this little dilly Dolly right here. This means it's not even showing them all to this.

345
00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:04.489
Anthony Taylor: There's a lot of them cool thing with Vs code. If you see this, you can actually click on this.

346
00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:06.020
Anthony Taylor: and it will show you

347
00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:17.060
Anthony Taylor: all of them. okay, there's a lot. Alright.  So that's how you can do it. You can also

348
00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:20.599
Anthony Taylor: to account of unique values.

349
00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:28.909
Anthony Taylor: So we can say. click this. And we can see there's 519 of these. That's a lot.

350
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.660
Anthony Taylor: Alright. But maybe normal. With this, this is what we're doing. We're learning about our data.

351
00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:38.939
Anthony Taylor: So let's see if let's say we want to see the count of each value.

352
00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:51.530
Anthony Taylor: because we know there's what 1,800 rows. right? 1,818 rows. There's only 500 unique values.

353
00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:59.649
Anthony Taylor: 519. So let's see the count of each value. So for this we use data frame column.

354
00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:08.139
Anthony Taylor: and then a new method called value counts. and we can, and notice we can chain head to the end of it.

355
00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:13.810
Anthony Taylor: So this is going to give us the first 10 value counts of employer.

356
00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:15.309
Anthony Taylor: What that means

357
00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:20.220
Anthony Taylor: is, it will, in order return

358
00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:23.900
Anthony Taylor: the number of times each of these show up.

359
00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:26.750
Anthony Taylor: so not employed, 609 times

360
00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.140
Anthony Taylor: done 321 times.

361
00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:32.910
Anthony Taylor: Self-employed 132 times self

362
00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:46.980
Anthony Taylor: 33. Okay. Retired Ingram. Pan American life insurance self-employed 15. So something weird about that. Right? Wouldn't you guys say, that's some messy data.

363
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:57.080
Anthony Taylor: I'm guessing that this column is somebody can hand type into it. Right? So we have a problem. Don't you agree? What's the problem?

364
00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:07.610
Jennifer Dahlgren: You have to recode these values into? Not employed, self-employed. etc.

365
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:10.319
Anthony Taylor: Right? So when they say not employed

366
00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:14.430
Anthony Taylor: they and none. Those are probably same thing. Yeah.

367
00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:20.299
Anthony Taylor: Self employed and self and self space employed

368
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:23.170
Anthony Taylor: are almost definitely the same thing as well.

369
00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:30.919
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so what we need to do is basically alter these data values

370
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:37.620
Anthony Taylor: so that they're all the same, and that they actually make sense. So they give us a better picture of what we're looking at.

371
00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:40.860
Anthony Taylor: So here's what we're gonna do to do that we're gonna to.

372
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:45.940
Anthony Taylor: We're only now I want you to pay attention, because the first time this has been said.

373
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:50.480
Anthony Taylor: we're going to only change this column

374
00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:56.110
Anthony Taylor: in our data frame. So we're doing data frame and the column name equals

375
00:36:57.150 --> 00:36:58.160
Anthony Taylor: got it.

376
00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:03.010
Anthony Taylor: Then we're going to say that column that we're looking at.

377
00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:14.250
Anthony Taylor: And we're going to do the replace method. Now, we're gonna do multiple replacements. So in the method we're going to pass in a dictionary, and it's just like the ones before

378
00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:19.710
Anthony Taylor: the key is the old value. The value is the new value.

379
00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:27.510
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to change self to self-dash employed, and self-space employed to self-dash employed.

380
00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:31.740
Anthony Taylor: got it. So now, when we run this

381
00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:36.780
Anthony Taylor: and do the same value counts that we did before.

382
00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:41.460
Anthony Taylor: We will see that it fixed that. Now

383
00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:45.360
Anthony Taylor: this is interesting. So I'm actually gonna go up one and run this

384
00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:53.809
Anthony Taylor: because that one down there does other things. So now you'll see there's a self-employed, but there's no longer a self or a self space employer.

385
00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:58.990
Anthony Taylor: and it has now put, combined them all into a single value.

386
00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:09.839
Anthony Taylor: Now, down here, they're gonna do this value counts, but then they're gonna fix, not employed and make it unemployed and then do it again, which is, I don't know what.

387
00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:13.190
Anthony Taylor: So let's run this. So

388
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:18.710
Anthony Taylor: okay, so unemployed, self-employed none.

389
00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:28.960
Anthony Taylor: I still think that should be unemployed. But they didn't make us do it. So whatever. Okay, but this is one of those things that you would do as a data analyst.

390
00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:37.460
Anthony Taylor: it would be your job to find out if, especially if you're the domain owner, which domain owner means. This is your data.

391
00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:46.109
Anthony Taylor: You're supposed to understand it. Okay, if you're just the data analyst. Then you might go to the data owner and say, Hey.

392
00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.409
Anthony Taylor: when they say none, do they really mean unemployed?

393
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.099
Anthony Taylor: Right? And and maybe they're like, Well.

394
00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:56.320
Anthony Taylor: baby. but let's leave it none.

395
00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:59.710
Anthony Taylor: Or yes, that's unemployed. Put them together.

396
00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:08.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay, or could none also be self-employed? Depends on how they ask the question right?

397
00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:13.609
Anthony Taylor: Who's your? If I asked you who's your employer?

398
00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:21.540
Anthony Taylor: And you're self-employed? Don't have an employer. Right? You are your employer. So you might put in.

399
00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:25.419
But if you're unemployed, you might also put none. So anyway.

400
00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:28.730
Anthony Taylor: data analysis, that's how that works.

401
00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:30.960
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so

402
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:36.880
Anthony Taylor: statistical overview.

403
00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:44.730
Anthony Taylor:  going back up to our D types real quick.

404
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:48.300
Anthony Taylor: How many numbers

405
00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:54.079
Anthony Taylor: are in our data? Here's our d types.

406
00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.630
Anthony Taylor: So here's all our columns.

407
00:39:57.950 --> 00:40:01.949
Anthony Taylor: I told you, object is a string. Oh, wait! What was that in chat

408
00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:06.529
Anthony Taylor: employed and like Oh. thank you, Mike.

409
00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:11.620
Anthony Taylor:  So how many numbers do we got there?

410
00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:17.660
Dipinto, Matt: One

411
00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.599
Anthony Taylor: one amount.

412
00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:28.550
Anthony Taylor: So when you use describe. It will do some summary statistics on every number in your data frame.

413
00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:38.929
Anthony Taylor: If you only have one. You're only going to get one back. Okay. In this case, the one is the amount column. It does account

414
00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:43.550
Anthony Taylor: a mean a standard deviation, a minimum.

415
00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:49.019
Anthony Taylor: 25 percentile fiftieth percentile, 70 fifth percentile and a maximum.

416
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:51.450
Anthony Taylor: It's good information.

417
00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:56.389
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And it's really quick. All you gotta do is type, describe.

418
00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:58.870
Anthony Taylor: And you get this for every number

419
00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:04.400
Anthony Taylor: in your system. Now, you could calculate most of these yourself

420
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:09.280
Anthony Taylor: by doing data frame column in brackets

421
00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:15.189
Anthony Taylor: and then count dot min dot max dot mean works the same

422
00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:19.039
Anthony Taylor: gives you the same values as up above

423
00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:22.389
Anthony Taylor: seems like a lot of extra work.

424
00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:25.679
Anthony Taylor:  if you wanted

425
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.679
Anthony Taylor: the Max of the for an entire data frame.

426
00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:38.410
Anthony Taylor: you can do this, and this does it on all of the individual columns. So Max, on a string is alphabetical order.

427
00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.320
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

428
00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:43.919
Anthony Taylor: yeah. I don't know

429
00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:46.340
Anthony Taylor: the boss. He's like taking them out.

430
00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:55.590
Anthony Taylor: So you know the name. Yeah, go ahead.

431
00:41:55.780 --> 00:42:02.730
Baro, Sonja: Column. These are related. This is, yeah, okay.

432
00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:06.710
Anthony Taylor: yeah. They. They do not have to be all I mean. It would be really weird

433
00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:13.030
Anthony Taylor: if Nathaniels wig employed as Wj. Lived in Zanesville, Wyoming.

434
00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:21.879
Anthony Taylor: and happened to have a 997-23-0255 zip code. and was the highest donator in the whole thing.

435
00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:26.310
Anthony Taylor: That would be an amazing coincidence

436
00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:27.799
Anthony Taylor: was a good question.

437
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:34.090
Anthony Taylor: Alright! So now we're all done with our data frame. We've kind of cleaned it up. Everything looks good.

438
00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:39.150
Anthony Taylor: Let's just write it out. And that's it. Okay?

439
00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:43.299
Anthony Taylor: And then there's a cool little link for more functions if we wanna do

440
00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:49.720
Anthony Taylor: alright. So let's real quick review all of the things we just learned cause we actually learned a lot. but

441
00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:54.730
Anthony Taylor: I don't know if it's a lot. Alright. So we did read Csv, we've done that. We've done head

442
00:42:54.800 --> 00:43:02.330
Anthony Taylor: delete DEL. The cool thing about delete is we don't have to assign it to a new data frame. It just happens

443
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:05.400
Anthony Taylor: when you run it. It is destructive.

444
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:14.680
Anthony Taylor: Drop in a. We talked about 2 ways to run, drop in a right any, if any, column, and if any column in your row is null.

445
00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.580
Anthony Taylor: that whole row goes away.

446
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:21.170
Anthony Taylor: All every column in your row is null.

447
00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:22.560
Okay?

448
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:30.259
Anthony Taylor: Data d types tells us what types of data is in our data frame

449
00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:36.740
Anthony Taylor: as type allows us to convert a column to

450
00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:42.450
Anthony Taylor: another data type. Now, be aware, if you tried to convert city

451
00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:45.190
Anthony Taylor: to an integer.

452
00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:47.849
Anthony Taylor: it's going to error out on every single one of them.

453
00:43:49.580 --> 00:44:01.860
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so keep that in mind. You know, this only works like this. When can logically become that new data type. a number to a string will almost always work.

454
00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:06.770
Anthony Taylor: A string to a number will never work unless that string happens to be a number.

455
00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:08.840
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

456
00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:17.239
Anthony Taylor: We can list, individual data type. We can see unique values by passing in data frame and a column.

457
00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:24.759
Anthony Taylor: we can get a unique count by doing in unique.

458
00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:26.710
Anthony Taylor: okay.

459
00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:37.320
Anthony Taylor: we can get the counts of of the individual values in a column. By using value counts

460
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:44.149
Anthony Taylor: we can replace values in our columns using

461
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:51.510
Anthony Taylor: column name dot replay. Now, with this in mind, what if I wanted to create a column called Employer 2.

462
00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:00.480
Anthony Taylor: Could I do it?

463
00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:04.830
Natalie Mason: Would you have to do a replace.

464
00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:10.000
Natalie Mason: and that, put it in the definition of replace.

465
00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:19.659
Anthony Taylor: Very close replace. But replace only affects the value of the column. What I want to do is create a new column entirely.

466
00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:28.890
Anthony Taylor: Just replace that employer by employer, too, the first one right here.

467
00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:35.619
Anthony Taylor: If I wanted to call an employer, too, I could do that, and it would create a new column called Employer 2.

468
00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:41.990
Anthony Taylor: It would fill it with this data from employer, with these replacements being done to it.

469
00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:51.010
Anthony Taylor: Alright, this is something that I often do like I've been having. I have this file actually same when they had the the blank rows.

470
00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:54.690
Anthony Taylor: and for some reason. November

471
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:57.689
Anthony Taylor: first, 2,023

472
00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:06.569
Anthony Taylor: gets written as 0 1 0 1, 2,023. Now, at first, that seems like a simple problem.

473
00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:15.009
Anthony Taylor: but it works for October, November or no. It works for October, September, August. It works for the rest of the year.

474
00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:18.750
Anthony Taylor: Only November does it mess up.

475
00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:29.449
Anthony Taylor: I'm like this is the craziest damn thing I've ever seen. So one of my troubleshooting efforts, I'm like, you know what? Let's just make a new column of this date, because I want to look at it closer.

476
00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:42.060
Anthony Taylor: But I don't want to lose the original. So I just do you know, new date or date test, or whatever in this spot, right here, and then just basically put the name of the old column

477
00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:48.620
Anthony Taylor: as value, and then boom. It just creates very easy to create a new column.

478
00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:57.629
Baro, Sonja: So, Anthony, I'm not. That's literally I just wanna check on terminology. Pad is literally adding an additional column

479
00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:07.840
Baro, Sonja: that in this case you would have the same values in each. They'd have a different header, employer, and employer. 2, right? Yes.

480
00:47:08.050 --> 00:47:12.790
Anthony Taylor: exactly. You can even do something like this equals

481
00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:15.110
Anthony Taylor: the F bracket.

482
00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:29.130
Anthony Taylor:  so you could do this just to like make a backup right? Right? So this will create a new column in our data frame with the data from this call

483
00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:34.599
Anthony Taylor: and then. Now, I can make changes to this column, but it won't make changes to this one

484
00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:47.019
Anthony Taylor: unless I rerun this right. And the idea is is, I mean, the way I use this all the time is that I'm trying to like fix something or solve something, and I need to.

485
00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:52.990
Anthony Taylor: I need to keep the old, the values the same, so that I can go back to them or look at what they used to be

486
00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.160
Anthony Taylor: or something.

487
00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:58.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So this is a totally valid and commonly used

488
00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:02.080
Anthony Taylor: statement. okay.

489
00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:10.730
Anthony Taylor: alright cool. So here again, we're doing value counts to see individual counts here. You can see we're doing replace again.

490
00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:16.830
Anthony Taylor: And we have our old value and our new value. This is only affecting the data clear on that.

491
00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:18.300
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

492
00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:25.700
Anthony Taylor: describe gives us some summary statistics on any numerical column

493
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:33.810
Anthony Taylor: that is in our data frame. And if there was more than one absolutely, we would get multiple columns right here

494
00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:36.820
Anthony Taylor: are multiple rows, no multiple columns.

495
00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:39.060
Anthony Taylor: one for each numeric value.

496
00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:45.329
Anthony Taylor: And then Max gives us all the Max values. And of course, 2 Csv.

497
00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:47.470
Anthony Taylor: so any questions.

498
00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:53.579
Anthony Taylor: That was a lot. But it wasn't a lot right? I mean, it's a lot of stuff. But yeah.

499
00:48:56.010 --> 00:49:01.160
Anthony Taylor: no, no questions. Alright. we allow

500
00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:04.040
Anthony Taylor: long, low activity with you.

501
00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:07.459
Anthony Taylor: Let's take a look

502
00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:19.000
Anthony Taylor: so flick through everything here. Read in the Csv file. Well, we all know how to do that right. Read Csv

503
00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:24.480
Anthony Taylor: print out a list of all unique values within the utility column. Which method was that

504
00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:29.600
Meredith McCanse (she/her): it unique?

505
00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:32.750
Anthony Taylor: Exactly. Exactly. I hate when I do that.

506
00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:44.150
Anthony Taylor: I double clicked it and it takes it out of the preview. Create a new data frame that only includes electricity usage for Internet owned units. What do you think you're going to do there?

507
00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:47.039
Anthony Taylor: What method have we done that does this?

508
00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:53.979
Anthony Taylor: We did it in the first activity. Does that help?

509
00:49:57.510 --> 00:50:00.360
Anthony Taylor: Yes, thank you, Meredith. Look

510
00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:03.179
Anthony Taylor: okay, then we're gonna sort.

511
00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:13.380
Anthony Taylor: And mostly so going down descending order. we're going to reset the index so that the index is in order.

512
00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:16.509
Anthony Taylor: That literally gives you the answer.

513
00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:22.710
Anthony Taylor: We're going to print out the details of the highest usage month.

514
00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:32.880
Anthony Taylor: Let you think about that one show some summary statistics for the whole data frame find the average usage.

515
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:36.580
Anthony Taylor: That was we did do that in here, right?

516
00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:43.060
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, on this, on the last one

517
00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:44.380
Anthony Taylor: right here.

518
00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:48.780
Baro, Sonja: Meme, yeah, okay. okay.

519
00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:58.179
Anthony Taylor: yeah, that's your average usage and then find the total usage. Now, we did not do total anybody. You wanna guess what method total will be

520
00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:02.999
Baro, Sonja: some. I know. Some know. What was that? Some

521
00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:04.840
some not total

522
00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:08.920
Baro, Sonja: good, good guess. But some is what you're gonna be looking for?

523
00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:10.050
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

524
00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:13.689
Anthony Taylor: Alright, that's it. So there's basically what you got to do.

525
00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.259
Anthony Taylor: Let me see what they give you. I didn't even look

526
00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:32.129
Anthony Taylor: okay. Good. So they've given you the answers on most of these. So all you gotta do is figure out what the what you got to write in there to make that answer appear.

527
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:35.430
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Hi.

528
00:51:36.050 --> 00:51:40.819
Anthony Taylor: coolio, you got 20 min to do this one. Wait. Was it 20 or 25?

529
00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:43.100
It was 20?

530
00:51:45.450 --> 00:51:47.460
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, 20 min to do this one.

531
00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:52.660
Anthony Taylor: which is pretty long for us. We don't normally have a lot of 20 s.

532
00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:57.200
Anthony Taylor: I think you guys are. Gonna get it done easily.

533
00:51:57.770 --> 00:52:00.399
Anthony Taylor: Hi, gang 20 min. Call me if you need me.

534
01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:49.520
Anthony Taylor: Come on.

535
01:05:49.630 --> 01:05:51.610
Anthony Taylor: get your stuff. Let's go.

536
01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:10.929
Natalie Mason: You're muted, Anthony.

537
01:10:16.930 --> 01:10:19.260
Anthony Taylor: Good. Okay. How'd we do?

538
01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:24.550
Anthony Taylor: Pretty good?

539
01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:28.329
michael mcpherson: I like that I was able to. Yeah.

540
01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:30.250
Anthony Taylor: But go ahead.

541
01:10:31.410 --> 01:10:32.720
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Sorry. Go ahead, Mike.

542
01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:37.339
michael mcpherson: Oh, I was just saying I was able to follow along. Go ahead.

543
01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:40.590
Anthony Taylor: I like that. What was your question?

544
01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:43.660
Meredith McCanse (she/her): We ran into a snag on the

545
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:51.039
Meredith McCanse (she/her): question about show the highest usage. Now, I can't find it.

546
01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:54.159
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Show the highest usage

547
01:10:54.850 --> 01:11:04.049
Meredith McCanse (she/her): month, because if you did the the Max thing that was just going to give you the month name that starts the latest in the alphabet.

548
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:17.160
Meredith McCanse (she/her): and if you did like, we sort of talked through all the different things, but it didn't. We couldn't figure out how to do it in a way that it would summarize like. Put all the august ones together, and then give us the Max for that, and then put all that January ones together.

549
01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:32.149
Anthony Taylor: And show us for that cause. There's multiple lines of data for August or January, September, or whatever. And maybe we were overthinking it. But we couldn't quite figure out how to do it.

550
01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:43.659
Clayton Graves: We ended up sorting it by by month and displaying just August, and then we did the sum function. I don't know if that's right or not, but it seemed great.

551
01:11:43.850 --> 01:12:00.290
Anthony Taylor: so I mean it. I mean, I don't know. It may not be wrong. It might just be another way to do it, so I'll show you how we do it here. So we read in the data and we took a quick peek at it. Oh, got it! I'm just off on everything

552
01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:02.249
Dipinto, Matt: you are recording them.

553
01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:09.830
Anthony Taylor: I know, actually recorded half of that while you guys were gone so you could watch me like looking at my cell phone for a while

554
01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:11.640
Anthony Taylor: when you're

555
01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:16.879
Anthony Taylor: watching the video later. Very exciting stuff.

556
01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:29.450
Anthony Taylor: Sometimes, you know, Kevin and me and James will get into like a crazy conversation or something, and you could have caught that. But not this time. I was just watching it. Okay.

557
01:12:31.710 --> 01:12:43.779
Anthony Taylor: so we just read it in the file. Alright, it said. Get the unique utility values. So we were able to do that with calling the data frame utility column and the unique method.

558
01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:52.479
Anthony Taylor: So that works out wonderfully, says, create a new data frame that includes only electricity. Usage for tenant owned units.

559
01:12:52.930 --> 01:12:58.060
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So what we needed to do is we needed to do. And I don't know. Have we done this? And yet.

560
01:13:00.890 --> 01:13:05.489
Meredith McCanse (she/her): no, II don't think so.

561
01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:07.170
Anthony Taylor: I yeah, I know.

562
01:13:07.230 --> 01:13:16.480
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So we're doing low. Maybe maybe we did this with the filters. But we're doing low and we're saying where utility equals electricity

563
01:13:16.570 --> 01:13:18.020
Anthony Taylor: and

564
01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:21.409
Anthony Taylor: owner equals tenant.

565
01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:25.239
Anthony Taylor: and then we're returning all columns.

566
01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:34.790
Anthony Taylor: If you omitted the all columns Colon in there, all columns is, will is will default to that.

567
01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:36.619
Anthony Taylor: If you wanted to do like

568
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:44.059
Anthony Taylor: something with the columns. You can't omit the first one. the colon for the rose, but you can omit this one

569
01:13:44.090 --> 01:13:51.109
Anthony Taylor: for columns. Okay. alright. So you can run that. And now we only have electricity in tenant.

570
01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:55.699
Anthony Taylor: Next it says, and this is the one you guys are talking about, right? The usage one

571
01:13:55.730 --> 01:13:59.450
Anthony Taylor: sort, the data frame by value in the usage column

572
01:13:59.470 --> 01:14:03.239
Anthony Taylor: to find the months with the highest usage.

573
01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:09.189
Anthony Taylor: The key here is you're going to sort the whole data frame

574
01:14:10.490 --> 01:14:11.870
Anthony Taylor: by usage.

575
01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:17.169
Anthony Taylor: which month has the highest usage.

576
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:23.360
Anthony Taylor: August of 2015, August, July, January, August

577
01:14:23.450 --> 01:14:24.600
Anthony Taylor: to 14.

578
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:42.970
Meredith McCanse (she/her): That was it, that's all. That was. That's why, when you said maybe you're over thinking it. That's that's the next one that we got. So here, it says, save all of the information collect collected

579
01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:47.719
Anthony Taylor: on the highest usage month. Basically, we just need the first row.

580
01:14:48.980 --> 01:15:06.519
Anthony Taylor: Oh, so it was not saying, like August in general, like, there's 12 months to choose from. It was like specifically August of 2,015 was the highest usage month. And so we got it. That's it. So you just had to do 0 and then return all columns. And you would get that series.

581
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:16.660
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so now we're gonna do a summary statistics on the whole data frame. There are 3 numbers. We have year, month, number and usage.

582
01:15:16.670 --> 01:15:22.500
Anthony Taylor: How useful is it to have the summary statistics on year and month number?

583
01:15:24.250 --> 01:15:33.149
Anthony Taylor: Okay, there's some there is still some value to it, because you can see, like the count, like all the rows, you know, there's 80 rows. You can see

584
01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:39.879
Anthony Taylor: the lowest year in the highest year, the lowest month in the highest month. That one's kind of weird

585
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:45.990
Anthony Taylor: right? There's some usefulness, but not a lot usage that's useful

586
01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:55.029
Anthony Taylor: to get the average usage. You just need to do data, frame the name of the column and the mean. and you will get that

587
01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:59.560
Anthony Taylor: so find the total usage for all August

588
01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:07.290
Anthony Taylor: on record now, because they didn't ask you for year. All they wanted to do is say we're month equals August.

589
01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:13.320
Anthony Taylor: And and here we're doing the loke thing. So this is month equals August

590
01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:19.540
Anthony Taylor: for the row to filter the rows. The column is usage.

591
01:16:20.850 --> 01:16:24.290
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then we want to sum it.

592
01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:26.930
Anthony Taylor: Does this make sense to everybody?

593
01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:38.350
Anthony Taylor: So this first one is in in Member Lok is always the row first. So this is the filter for the rows. This is the column that we want to return.

594
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:46.779
Anthony Taylor: and then we're going to Summit. We're gonna change some on to the end of it. and like magic.

595
01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:51.560
Anthony Taylor: And that's it. Pretty exciting

596
01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:54.410
Anthony Taylor: questions.

597
01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:08.910
Anthony Taylor: feeling good about this. Hi. well, if there are no questions, let's take 15 min. Let's come back at 20 min after

598
01:17:10.410 --> 01:17:11.439
Anthony Taylor: sound good.

599
01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:15.940
Anthony Taylor: I gang. Cn, cn, 15.

600
01:17:17.790 --> 01:17:22.220
michael mcpherson: Can you scroll back up to that one you went over with the the

601
01:17:22.330 --> 01:17:23.440
michael mcpherson: yeah.

602
01:17:23.650 --> 01:17:24.780
michael mcpherson: thanks, Kevin.

603
01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:28.409
Anthony Taylor: You want me to leave it there, or do you want me to talk about it?

604
01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:29.960
michael mcpherson: No, just leave

605
01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:30.990
okay.

606
01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:39.300
michael mcpherson: No way. I can work to figure stuff out for myself.

607
01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:44.540
Anthony Taylor: Data camp.

608
01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:48.469
Anthony Taylor: I assume everyone got their.

609
01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:52.850
Anthony Taylor: I still see 6 people that have not

610
01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:55.240
Anthony Taylor: actually accepted.

611
01:17:56.630 --> 01:18:02.329
Anthony Taylor: So those people that did not, and everybody excited everybody. Get it, that's all I really care about

612
01:18:06.410 --> 01:18:08.240
Anthony Taylor: where I got it, who

613
01:18:08.370 --> 01:18:12.950
Anthony Taylor: hold on. I don't want to necessarily share everybody's emails with everybody. So 1 s.

614
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:17.240
Anthony Taylor: let me go look and see who has not accepted yet.

615
01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:24.420
Anthony Taylor:  you don't really have to accept right now, I mean. I don't care that much, but II want

616
01:18:24.430 --> 01:18:30.740
Anthony Taylor: I think you should. Oh, I see somebody just now. Accept it. Kevin Hampton, you haven't accepted. Did you get it?

617
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:33.770
Anthony Taylor: Hello!

618
01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:38.219
Anthony Taylor: They should have it in your Gmail, Meredith.

619
01:18:40.350 --> 01:18:54.109
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I'm working on it right now. I didn't know we were supposed to. I was focusing on all the things we were learning. I didn't know we were supposed to. You do not have to accept it right now, but I'm going to show it to you. So if you want to follow along, I just created my password. So I'm good.

620
01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:56.730
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Thank you so often you still don't have it.

621
01:18:57.610 --> 01:18:58.830
michael mcpherson: I signed in.

622
01:18:59.110 --> 01:19:01.780
Anthony Taylor: Okay. alright.

623
01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:08.589
Anthony Taylor: Have to. Don't worry about it. If you don't get it, you'll you'll be okay either way, I'll get you. I will get it eventually for you quickly.

624
01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:11.379
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so let me turn my share back on.

625
01:19:16.630 --> 01:19:20.480
Anthony Taylor: Good. Alright So

626
01:19:21.130 --> 01:19:23.419
Anthony Taylor: what is data? Cam? So

627
01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:29.199
Anthony Taylor: I stumbled across this. I don't know. 5, 6 cohorts ago.

628
01:19:29.310 --> 01:19:42.559
Anthony Taylor: They had this thing called data camp classroom. and it says, if you haven't, if you're an instructor and you have an Edu account, which I don't have one in Denver, but I have one at Uci.

629
01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:45.020
Anthony Taylor: because I taught there for a very long time.

630
01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:49.150
Anthony Taylor: And since I still have it. I was able to get this again.

631
01:19:49.350 --> 01:20:01.469
Anthony Taylor: And basically, it's a 6 month. all inclusive subscription to this product. It is a very good product for learning what we're doing here.

632
01:20:01.610 --> 01:20:04.510
Anthony Taylor: And much more.

633
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:06.150
Anthony Taylor: So first

634
01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:13.740
Anthony Taylor: you would go to learn. And I mean, you can do this a lot of ways I would suggest, go to tracks

635
01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:15.829
Anthony Taylor: and skill tracks.

636
01:20:17.930 --> 01:20:27.200
Anthony Taylor: Now, before I get into all of these, I want just to kinda see what you now have available to you. It's nuts you have, python, you have sequi of r

637
01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:32.140
Anthony Taylor: power, bi tableau, excel spreadsheets, using excel spreadsheets.

638
01:20:32.170 --> 01:20:43.859
Anthony Taylor: Julia AI and machine learning and data literacy. All of these classes are available. What makes this special? Well, let me start with the power of the I one real quick.

639
01:20:44.010 --> 01:20:55.849
Anthony Taylor: So you guys aren't gonna learn any power bi or tableau in this course. So if you decided you wanted to pick that up, and, as you will see, depending on the jobs. A lot of them. Will

640
01:20:56.490 --> 01:20:59.429
Anthony Taylor: have some mention of reporting tools.

641
01:20:59.750 --> 01:21:09.950
Anthony Taylor: What I love about the power bi and the tableau is they actually like spin up a virtual machine in the background

642
01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:17.050
Anthony Taylor: and on that machine it's it. It. They have power, bi or tableau installed.

643
01:21:18.150 --> 01:21:35.610
Anthony Taylor: and you get it, and you can do the activities right there on their machine. In an actual version you don't have to use a trial. You don't have to pay for anything. Everything is there, and it tells you exactly what to do. I will tell you. These things aren't usually very fast.

644
01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:37.410
Anthony Taylor: but

645
01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:40.460
Anthony Taylor: they're they totally work.

646
01:21:40.810 --> 01:21:41.500
Okay.

647
01:21:41.710 --> 01:21:52.370
Anthony Taylor: And it's fine. And you just do each step. So we're opening that. And then we go here and we create a new column. And we do that. Okay, lots of fun. very, very cool.

648
01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:58.190
Anthony Taylor:  But you guys right now

649
01:21:58.610 --> 01:22:01.210
Anthony Taylor: are to be doing python.

650
01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:07.420
Anthony Taylor: I mean truthfully, it's yours. You could do what you want with it. I'm gonna give you recommendations.

651
01:22:08.310 --> 01:22:19.139
Anthony Taylor: I would suggest you stay with those recommendations. but it's up to you. So start with introduction to Python, and this is after you've done your homework.

652
01:22:20.250 --> 01:22:22.240
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Or

653
01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:24.109
Anthony Taylor: just make sure you have both.

654
01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:29.159
Anthony Taylor: You're gonna do fine in this first chapter. But I do want to show you what it looks like.

655
01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:44.009
Anthony Taylor: So what will happen? So like it starts with, as you would expect. like Hello, python tells you a little bit about python, and then it goes into variables like, just like we did right? Very first thing we did variables.

656
01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:50.849
Anthony Taylor: So if you look in here, it says you've now created a savings variable. This was in the actually, let's go. Live activity. That was really

657
01:22:52.020 --> 01:23:12.420
Anthony Taylor: okay. So it says in python, variable allows you to refer to a value with a name, create a variable X equals 5. You do. X equals 5. You can now use the name as a variable X instead. Remember, equals python assignment. It doesn't test quality. Then instructions create a variable save things with the value of 100. And see, I already did that normally it would look like that.

658
01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.019
Anthony Taylor: and you would have to type in

659
01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:21.300
Anthony Taylor: savings equals 100, and then it says, check this variable by T typing print savings in the script.

660
01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:27.009
Anthony Taylor: When you're done coding in this little window, you can hit, run code.

661
01:23:27.390 --> 01:23:34.180
Anthony Taylor: and it will run the code. If it is what they ask for, then submit the answer.

662
01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:44.129
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And I already I didn't get any experience, because I already did this one when I was showing people earlier. Alright. So you can hit, continue.

663
01:23:44.530 --> 01:23:46.070
Anthony Taylor: And then you do the next one.

664
01:23:47.450 --> 01:24:01.630
Anthony Taylor: Okay, there, almost all of them are like that. You can see that's going to be calculation of variables, other variables. Guess the type. And it's just gonna go on right when you're done with that one. Then there's python lists, and then there's functions all the stuff we already did.

665
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:07.070
Anthony Taylor: So you guys should be able to zoom through this. We're about to go through numpy right now.

666
01:24:08.170 --> 01:24:10.919
Anthony Taylor: Okay. and then

667
01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:21.219
Anthony Taylor: you're basically done with the intro to python, just like here. It's not in exactly the same order as we do it, but it is fairly close.

668
01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:23.989
Anthony Taylor: because it's how everybody teaches python.

669
01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:30.810
Anthony Taylor:  when you're done with the intro.

670
01:24:31.050 --> 01:24:36.060
Anthony Taylor: Okay. there is the next one.

671
01:24:37.230 --> 01:24:43.900
Anthony Taylor: And I mean, I don't really think I need to go into all of that. But the bottom line is python fundamentals all by itself

672
01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:45.240
Anthony Taylor: is

673
01:24:45.290 --> 01:24:46.680
4 courses.

674
01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:55.979
Anthony Taylor: So it's intro intermediate python for data is all stuff we're gonna do. What was that question?

675
01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:02.730
michael mcpherson: Is the is the certificate worth? Well, I'll I'll tell you this. Okay.

676
01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:10.170
Anthony Taylor: Last cohort. I had a girl who? She was a receptionist at Capital group.

677
01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:17.720
Anthony Taylor: and she we gave. I gave her this about same time as I'm giving it to you around the 20 s week

678
01:25:18.010 --> 01:25:21.080
Anthony Taylor: she was able to get the certification

679
01:25:21.410 --> 01:25:26.389
Anthony Taylor: from here. And she is now a data scientist at capital group.

680
01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:33.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So she went from receptionist to data scientist or so 8 Am. Or something.

681
01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:36.319
Kevin Nguyen: That's not Emily Zip

682
01:25:36.710 --> 01:25:41.980
Anthony Taylor: is Emily. She got it. Yeah, of course she did.

683
01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:44.550
Kevin Nguyen: Okay. Good. Awesome.

684
01:25:44.730 --> 01:25:53.139
Anthony Taylor: But yeah. So all of this stuff we are going to cover. I will tell you. It will go deeper in some areas and less deep in others.

685
01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:57.500
Anthony Taylor: So it's super duper handy.

686
01:25:57.530 --> 01:26:08.130
Anthony Taylor: And even if you don't do the certification, you do get a certificate of accomplishment that you can post on Linkedin or something like that. Okay, you don't need to do the skill assessment.

687
01:26:08.290 --> 01:26:10.140
I just I

688
01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:15.390
Anthony Taylor: I do it on all of mine just because people are like, Well, what's yours, man, and I'm like.

689
01:26:16.710 --> 01:26:18.779
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. What do you think?

690
01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:24.449
Anthony Taylor: But anyway, it's not perfect. I could have got 100, but I didn't.

691
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.820
Anthony Taylor: So, whatever nobody's perfect.

692
01:26:29.890 --> 01:26:38.139
Anthony Taylor: that's cool. Mike and I agree. W. 3 schools is very good and it's free. This is not free. This usually costs about 150 a year.

693
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:42.340
Anthony Taylor: But anyway. fantastic.

694
01:26:42.490 --> 01:26:48.430
Anthony Taylor: it's all yours. 6 months, so you'll have it through the rest of the course. And one month after the course

695
01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:57.160
Anthony Taylor:  what I normally tell students is, you know, as long as you're getting your challenges and stuff done on time, I say, go for it.

696
01:26:57.340 --> 01:27:01.819
Anthony Taylor: Go! Do you know, 2030 min of this class of of a class in here.

697
01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:10.639
Anthony Taylor: And you're gonna do really? Well, the cool thing is. there's so much extra stuff in here for you guys that

698
01:27:10.670 --> 01:27:22.190
Anthony Taylor: as you guys, as we get farther down the road because you're not going to learn a sequel in this class, you're not going to learn power bi or tableau. Right? Of course, you're gonna learn AI and machine learning. But even this in here is really

699
01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:29.420
Anthony Taylor: new. Okay? So it's not very deep. They have a lot, though. Look at this

700
01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:35.550
Anthony Taylor: lot of them are in are actually, that's what it is. They have 3 classes in our

701
01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:46.109
Anthony Taylor: on Ml. Ops, and like 2 classes, 3 classes in python.  So anyway. yeah, it's pretty cool.

702
01:27:46.210 --> 01:27:49.950
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Of the leader board. So

703
01:27:50.710 --> 01:27:55.610
Anthony Taylor: by no means is this important? But I have had classes

704
01:27:55.990 --> 01:28:02.679
Anthony Taylor: where some of the students decided they were going to try to top the leaderboard every day every week

705
01:28:03.310 --> 01:28:07.089
Anthony Taylor: alright, as you saw when I was doing the

706
01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:11.010
Anthony Taylor: this stuff a minute ago. Why is it not showing me

707
01:28:11.850 --> 01:28:12.920
Anthony Taylor: a leaderboard?

708
01:28:13.130 --> 01:28:17.729
Anthony Taylor: When I was doing stuff. It gives you experience as you complete stuff.

709
01:28:18.110 --> 01:28:19.050
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

710
01:28:19.170 --> 01:28:22.360
Anthony Taylor: So II and you guys

711
01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:30.660
Anthony Taylor: can see the Leader board. Now. Brandon was here when I first gave this out, so he was doing some of this during a look at Curry.

712
01:28:30.710 --> 01:28:35.390
Anthony Taylor:  He was doing some of this during

713
01:28:35.450 --> 01:28:40.379
Anthony Taylor: during office hours. I do not want to see these scores going up during class

714
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:42.310
Anthony Taylor: curry.

715
01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:47.440
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Anthony, how do we get to the leaderboard, are we? You guys can see it right?

716
01:28:47.670 --> 01:28:59.480
Anthony Taylor: I don't have the student view. So, Brandon, how do you see the leader? Yeah, I don't have a student view on this one. I have the.

717
01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:11.099
Anthony Taylor: This is the like, the whole, like the group view. So basically, what I have to do. And you'll see, see, I have all of these groups. These are all my former classes.

718
01:29:11.370 --> 01:29:23.980
Anthony Taylor: and and you know what they were in. So I created, I was able to request a group, a free group for you guys. And and this is it. So to my knowledge, we are the you are the only students.

719
01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:27.169
Anthony Taylor: My students are the only students that get this.

720
01:29:28.270 --> 01:29:30.229
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So yay.

721
01:29:33.610 --> 01:29:36.699
Anthony Taylor: and I'm very proud when I give this to you guys. So.

722
01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:39.100
Anthony Taylor: hoorah.

723
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:47.289
Anthony Taylor: any questions for the most part enjoy it. Have fun. And honestly, I get as many

724
01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:54.779
Anthony Taylor: users as I want. So you know, if you know somebody you want me to send them invite. I don't care.

725
01:29:55.200 --> 01:30:01.619
Anthony Taylor: It's gonna drive branding crazy because I'm gonna send it to like people. And he's gonna be like, wait, this person's not even in our class. And they're beating.

726
01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:02.730
It's like.

727
01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:10.800
Anthony Taylor: Thank you, Anthony, this is pretty great. Just so you guys know, this

728
01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:23.899
Anthony Taylor: is what we here at arthritis. They didn't have anything. And when I came in. I'm like, guys, this is what you need. So they evaluated it. And this is what all resources in the whole company that work with data.

729
01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:27.260
Anthony Taylor: They. This is what they're using to learn how to do stuff.

730
01:30:28.410 --> 01:30:35.529
Anthony Taylor: So and these are like, very experienced, very high paid people. So very cool, awesome.

731
01:30:35.630 --> 01:30:40.010
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I can see Matt's doing stuff right now, and we should refresh. See what he's doing.

732
01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.740
Dipinto, Matt: I was doing things. It just wasn't this.

733
01:30:48.930 --> 01:30:50.200
Anthony Taylor: Oh.

734
01:30:51.020 --> 01:30:52.080
Dipinto, Matt: I'm sorry

735
01:30:54.370 --> 01:30:56.860
Anthony Taylor: Mike did 50 points worth of stuff on it.

736
01:30:57.420 --> 01:31:01.069
Anthony Taylor: Okay, anyway, that's it. That's all there is on that

737
01:31:01.170 --> 01:31:10.690
michael mcpherson: I probably just walked around and was clicking stuff to look through it. Yeah, all you gotta do is watch like a lecture, and you get 50 points.

738
01:31:11.490 --> 01:31:23.200
Anthony Taylor: So it will start sending you emails like, hey? I mean, hey? If you don't go to it for a couple of days, it'll start sending you like reminders, hey? Don't forget you can learn some stuff

739
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.260
Anthony Taylor: so stuff like that. But

740
01:31:26.370 --> 01:31:34.300
Anthony Taylor: I probably won't bring it up very often after this. I mean, maybe the leaderboard thing. If you guys get into it. If anybody other than Brandon gets into it.

741
01:31:34.510 --> 01:31:42.609
Anthony Taylor: we'll we'll still get Brandon kudos, but it's like nobody's even trying to, you know. Keep up.

742
01:31:43.710 --> 01:31:45.799
Anthony Taylor: Take it to to make a big deal.

743
01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:48.030
Anthony Taylor: and

744
01:31:49.490 --> 01:31:50.490
that's it.

745
01:31:55.110 --> 01:32:07.259
Anthony Taylor: Oh, there you go. II will tell you, though. So the online search this is in response to Mics statement. It's funny cause somebody asked me today about certifications.

746
01:32:07.490 --> 01:32:10.509
Anthony Taylor: and my answer to them was.

747
01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:16.170
Anthony Taylor: once you start getting experience. The certifications don't mean much at all.

748
01:32:16.730 --> 01:32:20.559
Anthony Taylor: But they're very good for getting doors to open

749
01:32:21.970 --> 01:32:27.919
Anthony Taylor: right? So it's good, even even if the certifications are completely bogus, and a lot of them are

750
01:32:28.340 --> 01:32:41.139
Anthony Taylor:  it's it's a really great way to get a door open so that you can get an interview, because here's what's happening when you guys go do interviews. And this is this is like a precursor to what's coming in 20 weeks.

751
01:32:42.410 --> 01:32:53.180
Anthony Taylor: When you guys go do interviews. You're gonna know more than most people with years of experience in this area. Okay, that's just the way the boot camps work. The hard part is

752
01:32:53.950 --> 01:32:58.899
Anthony Taylor: getting the interview because you don't have the experience for them to call you in.

753
01:32:59.220 --> 01:33:03.520
Anthony Taylor: So anything we can do to get that interview.

754
01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:08.519
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, we gotta do. Because once you get in there, you're gonna do. Great. You're gonna wow them

755
01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:17.339
Anthony Taylor: right? I can't tell you how many employers. And and we do this thing called a demo day where we invite

756
01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:21.390
Anthony Taylor: basically, people like me that aren't instructors.

757
01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:31.080
Anthony Taylor: We invite them and the students do their presentations. And and the the comments are almost always a holy crap. They learn that in 6 months

758
01:33:31.470 --> 01:33:37.670
Anthony Taylor: stuff like that. So I mean, it's people are just amazed by how much you guys will learn. So

759
01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:40.199
Anthony Taylor: getting in the front door is a big deal.

760
01:33:41.410 --> 01:33:45.799
Anthony Taylor: and certificates will help with that. Do I think you need it? No, I do not.

761
01:33:46.430 --> 01:33:47.150
Anthony Taylor: but

762
01:33:48.530 --> 01:33:53.660
Anthony Taylor: it's out there if you want. Okay. that's all I had to say about that, like I said.

763
01:33:54.170 --> 01:34:01.059
Anthony Taylor: I might ask you, are you doing data camp? But I probably won't bug you about it, because it's just a free tool for you to use

764
01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:09.200
Anthony Taylor: numpy. So the next thing we're gonna cover is a couple of new libraries.

765
01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:19.399
Anthony Taylor: Numpy. which is a numerical python library. Now, the biggest difference between Numpy and

766
01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:28.579
Anthony Taylor: something like pandas is, if you recall Pandas introduced us to 2 new data types. Right? If I remember what they were

767
01:34:30.650 --> 01:34:32.440
Baro, Sonja: series and data frames

768
01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:38.699
Anthony Taylor: series and data frames so numpy. While these aren't necessarily new data types.

769
01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:49.570
Anthony Taylor: they? It is particularly good at working with arrays and matrices. Okay. so

770
01:34:53.740 --> 01:35:02.940
Anthony Taylor: and so that's why we're gonna use numpy. You'll see some usages of that Sci-pi

771
01:35:03.340 --> 01:35:12.399
Anthony Taylor: is. So you can think like a statistical calculator like a scientific calculator. Remember, I don't know those of you that remember when we had calculators

772
01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:14.179
Anthony Taylor: and not just cell phones

773
01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:25.049
Anthony Taylor: right? And you had the little calculator that had division multiplication. you know. Addition, subtraction. Then you add the other, calculate

774
01:35:25.710 --> 01:35:27.700
Anthony Taylor: with like 40 buttons on it.

775
01:35:27.810 --> 01:35:32.389
Anthony Taylor: Right? That was the scientific calculator. So think sci-fi like scientific calculator

776
01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:35.099
michael mcpherson: slice for the win.

777
01:35:38.980 --> 01:35:39.900
Anthony Taylor: Yes.

778
01:35:41.230 --> 01:35:44.850
Anthony Taylor: what? Okay?

779
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:51.680
Anthony Taylor: You know what a slide rule is right. Oh, yeah, slide rule. Okay. I didn't hear that. I think you broke up. So what we heard was site.

780
01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:57.050
Anthony Taylor: I'm in love with my slide rules.

781
01:35:57.190 --> 01:36:03.530
Anthony Taylor: Well, that's good. Alright. So we're gonna talk about some statistical things today.

782
01:36:03.570 --> 01:36:11.559
Anthony Taylor: I I'm gonna give you the good news right now. You do not need to know statistics to do anything in this class.

783
01:36:12.230 --> 01:36:16.370
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you need to understand. like.

784
01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:22.600
Anthony Taylor: when you need to run certain methods that will return statistical results.

785
01:36:24.010 --> 01:36:32.340
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So you don't need to know how to calculate anything, because we're gonna have methods that'll do it for us. But you need to know when to calculate those things.

786
01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:37.789
Anthony Taylor: And we'll learn that over time. Right today, we are still talking about

787
01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:42.350
Anthony Taylor: how to basically explore our data frame.

788
01:36:43.810 --> 01:36:45.670
Anthony Taylor: The first

789
01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:51.300
Anthony Taylor: important statistic we're gonna talk about. And it's actually more than one

790
01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:52.510
Anthony Taylor: is

791
01:36:52.860 --> 01:37:07.280
Anthony Taylor: central tendency. So before I go any further, II have some people that do statistics. I have people that probably just covered this in the past. What are measures of central tendency? There's

792
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:11.529
Anthony Taylor: 3 I'm looking for. But let's see what you guys come up with. So anybody know of any.

793
01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:15.260
Anthony Taylor: We talked about one today.

794
01:37:15.770 --> 01:37:17.420
Jennifer Dahlgren: Lean, Median and Mode

795
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:20.769
Anthony Taylor: Jennifer nailed all 3 of them

796
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:29.250
Anthony Taylor: mean Median and mood. Those are the 3 measures of central tendency we're going to concern ourselves with.

797
01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:34.789
Anthony Taylor: Alright. The goal of these is to identify the middle of our data.

798
01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:38.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, you're like, Well.

799
01:37:40.530 --> 01:37:45.610
Anthony Taylor: why are there 3 of them? We only need to find the middle. Well, because there's different ways to find the middle.

800
01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:50.339
Anthony Taylor: So a mean is literally just the average. I'm not gonna read their their silly

801
01:37:50.570 --> 01:37:56.230
Anthony Taylor: explanation. It's the average everybody here knows. Average median is the

802
01:37:56.250 --> 01:37:57.700
Anthony Taylor: physical

803
01:37:57.900 --> 01:38:10.499
Anthony Taylor: center. It is the middle is average and middle the same not always. Okay. Mode is the value that occurs the most often.

804
01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:23.859
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now, if you have a value that is like a really high mode. Could it affect the mean? Absolutely? Okay. But it does. Doesn't mean it's the center, not usually.

805
01:38:24.190 --> 01:38:26.819
Anthony Taylor: But we're gonna find out and determine.

806
01:38:27.170 --> 01:38:41.159
Anthony Taylor:  those libraries we talked about Numpy and Scipy. We're going to use numpy to calculate. Mean. we're going to use numpy to calculate Median. But we're going to use sci-fi to calculate mode.

807
01:38:44.910 --> 01:38:46.450
Anthony Taylor: This is one of those.

808
01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:50.480
Anthony Taylor: Why? But yeah, for whatever reason.

809
01:38:50.750 --> 01:38:52.400
Anthony Taylor: Numpy doesn't have a mode.

810
01:38:53.330 --> 01:38:57.490
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so here's our first example, if your data

811
01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:02.660
Anthony Taylor: is normally distributed. everybody's heard of the bell curve.

812
01:39:03.150 --> 01:39:08.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay, a perfect bell curve is perfect normal distribution.

813
01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:14.090
Anthony Taylor: which means there is exactly the same amount on the left as there is on the right.

814
01:39:15.700 --> 01:39:16.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

815
01:39:18.180 --> 01:39:19.980
Anthony Taylor: just have somebody beat.

816
01:39:20.770 --> 01:39:22.169
Anthony Taylor: We got it. Okay? Good.

817
01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:31.510
Anthony Taylor:  So when we do the average, if the exact same is on the left and the right average is going to be dead center memes going to be dead center.

818
01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:38.609
Anthony Taylor: I'm sorry I just said, that Median's gonna be dead center and the mode will be dead center. So all 3 of them

819
01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:41.420
Anthony Taylor: are going to be this central line.

820
01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:53.429
Anthony Taylor: Does it matter which one you use. Not at all. Okay. The good news is well, not even good news. The reality is not. Everything is perfectly normally distributed.

821
01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:56.480
Anthony Taylor: However, what you're going to find

822
01:39:56.660 --> 01:39:57.680
Anthony Taylor: is that

823
01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:11.639
Anthony Taylor: a lot of the times it is? It may not be the perfect bell curve, but it will be. You will see, there will be low values. There will be central values, and there will be lower or high values. And mostly

824
01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:16.370
Anthony Taylor: a lot of data is considered to be

825
01:40:17.090 --> 01:40:19.880
Anthony Taylor: a normal distribution. It doesn't have to be perfect.

826
01:40:20.490 --> 01:40:22.109
Anthony Taylor: Just has to follow that

827
01:40:23.060 --> 01:40:28.959
Anthony Taylor: curve. So like this one. Here is this one a normal distribution? Well, absolutely not. It's totally skewed.

828
01:40:29.330 --> 01:40:35.010
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but here's a great example. The number that exact comes in the most is up here.

829
01:40:35.740 --> 01:40:39.830
Anthony Taylor: The median is over here and look at the mean, holy, Moly.

830
01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:49.960
Anthony Taylor: so which one of these is the best to determine. The center of this data set. and by Wyoming. Yes.

831
01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:58.320
Anthony Taylor: nobody wants to even guess.

832
01:40:59.790 --> 01:41:04.140
michael mcpherson: II would say, Oh, go ahead! What was that? I was? Gonna say, what's the research question?

833
01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:14.320
Anthony Taylor: Jennifer's good at this stuff? So no matter what you answer, Michael, I would have said exactly what Jennifer said in my terminology, which is.

834
01:41:14.530 --> 01:41:17.550
Anthony Taylor: depends on the use case depends on what you're trying to do

835
01:41:17.630 --> 01:41:19.100
Anthony Taylor: what you're looking for.

836
01:41:19.250 --> 01:41:24.249
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you would need more information to say for sure. If I'm just eyeballing it.

837
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:26.040
Anthony Taylor: I would probably say, Media.

838
01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:35.679
Anthony Taylor: okay, but you would need more information to really know what the center is. Okay. And that is what is the data. What makes sense? Right?

839
01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:38.720
Anthony Taylor: So yeah, that's good.

840
01:41:39.380 --> 01:41:41.350
michael mcpherson: Okay, same thing

841
01:41:41.540 --> 01:41:45.739
michael mcpherson: you were. Gonna say same thing, Mike. I love that. He broke through my kung fu first.

842
01:41:46.050 --> 01:41:47.130
Anthony Taylor: Oh.

843
01:41:48.270 --> 01:41:51.180
Anthony Taylor: your latency sometimes gets in the way, I agree.

844
01:41:52.130 --> 01:41:53.140
michael mcpherson: and what?

845
01:41:53.330 --> 01:41:59.620
Anthony Taylor: That's all right. It's all good. It's all good. Before the class is over I will crawl through the

846
01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:01.220
michael mcpherson: thing and

847
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:07.120
michael mcpherson: run a cat? 5 up to up here. But until then.

848
01:42:07.390 --> 01:42:09.670
Anthony Taylor: okay, so

849
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:16.929
Anthony Taylor: some other statistical definitions that we're going to cover today.

850
01:42:17.050 --> 01:42:18.250
Anthony Taylor: variance

851
01:42:18.370 --> 01:42:23.110
Anthony Taylor: standard deviation and Z score. And why do we cover these? Well.

852
01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:26.639
Anthony Taylor: all of these things are going to have something to do with this bell curve.

853
01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:30.819
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so let's take a look

854
01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:34.309
Anthony Taylor: first, we're going to start with variance and variance

855
01:42:34.770 --> 01:42:45.100
Anthony Taylor: as soon as you see the definition. I mean, it basically makes sense. Why, it's called variance. We're basically looking at the variability of our data or

856
01:42:45.540 --> 01:42:53.020
Anthony Taylor: from a statistical definition, how far the values in the data set are from the mean overall.

857
01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:58.999
Anthony Taylor: So we calculate. So when this is calculated, it calculates the mean, and it determines

858
01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:03.890
Anthony Taylor: how far the values overall are from that center.

859
01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:09.040
Anthony Taylor: And it tells us how much variation. So a high variance.

860
01:43:09.220 --> 01:43:19.909
Anthony Taylor: We know there's a lot of variation. And here's how we're gonna explain it. So this function, I don't care if you ever remember this, ever you do not need to recognize it.

861
01:43:20.790 --> 01:43:25.170
Anthony Taylor: It's just it's just here to impress you. Okay.

862
01:43:25.350 --> 01:43:33.480
Anthony Taylor:  oh, very cool. So we're gonna it describes how far the values are from the mean.

863
01:43:33.490 --> 01:43:46.619
Anthony Taylor: It describes how much variation exists, and you consider the distance of each value in the data set from the center of the data. That's basically what it's doing. Okay? And that's it. So all you gotta worry about right now.

864
01:43:47.190 --> 01:43:50.370
Anthony Taylor: what is variance? Aye.

865
01:43:50.740 --> 01:44:04.229
Anthony Taylor: standard deviate. Now, here's the thing about variance. When we discuss variance, we're going to get this crazy number. It's an important number, but it's not in the same unit of measure as your data.

866
01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:06.769
Anthony Taylor: So let's say, your data is in feet.

867
01:44:08.370 --> 01:44:13.569
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And we do this. And they say, you know, variances

868
01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:18.599
Anthony Taylor: 244. You're like 24 feet.

869
01:44:19.220 --> 01:44:28.280
Anthony Taylor: Seems like a lot right? But because it's not in the same unit of measure as your data.

870
01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:31.339
Anthony Taylor: it's it's a little harder to

871
01:44:32.450 --> 01:44:33.510
Anthony Taylor: translate

872
01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:37.259
Anthony Taylor: standard deviation. On the other hand.

873
01:44:37.390 --> 01:44:46.500
Anthony Taylor: in the same measure as your data. So if your data is measured in feet when we calculate standard deviation. It's going to be

874
01:44:46.570 --> 01:44:47.930
Anthony Taylor: 12 feet.

875
01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:59.679
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So now it'll make a little more sense. So standard deviation is really just the square root of the variance which gets us back to the unit of measure.

876
01:45:00.010 --> 01:45:09.219
Anthony Taylor: So it describes how far it again, because it's really just the square root of the variance. It describes the same thing.

877
01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:17.520
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so it describes how far everything is from the mean. It gets calculated with square root of variance, and it's in the same unit of measurement.

878
01:45:17.690 --> 01:45:18.570
Anthony Taylor: So

879
01:45:20.970 --> 01:45:25.829
Anthony Taylor: this is what reason why we do this? So one standard deviation

880
01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:29.140
Anthony Taylor: from the meme right there?

881
01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.360
Anthony Taylor: All right. What is that number who knows?

882
01:45:32.650 --> 01:45:37.039
Anthony Taylor: Okay. 2 standard deviations from the mean

883
01:45:37.110 --> 01:45:38.880
michael mcpherson: right there.

884
01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:41.340
Anthony Taylor: Sorry, Mike.

885
01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:56.089
Anthony Taylor: The dark blue is 67. The light blue is 16 up. Assuming it is perfectly distributed. Yes, that is the was it? 99, 97, 66. I don't know something like that.

886
01:45:56.310 --> 01:46:00.820
michael mcpherson: I think we, I think we cover that at some percent or bottom one.

887
01:46:01.100 --> 01:46:12.589
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, there's a there is definitely a specific formula for perfectly distributed data. And it doesn't look like it's in

888
01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:21.779
Anthony Taylor: my lecture today. But anyway, so one distribution, 2 or one standard deviation, 2. Standard deviations. 3. Okay.

889
01:46:23.260 --> 01:46:27.860
Anthony Taylor:  yeah. So we often will

890
01:46:27.910 --> 01:46:38.659
Anthony Taylor: talk about things is how many standard deviations from the beam. They are. Okay. Don't stress too much about that yet. It'll we have functions that do this for us.

891
01:46:38.980 --> 01:46:43.770
Anthony Taylor: So we don't even have to remember how to do it. We just need to know that sometimes we need to know that.

892
01:46:44.170 --> 01:46:48.670
Anthony Taylor: Okay, a z-score. So see all these points in here.

893
01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:57.719
Anthony Taylor: these are all within this. So like all these points, right here are within one standard deviation. In other words, they're in this dark blue.

894
01:46:57.820 --> 01:47:11.749
Anthony Taylor: and these points are within one standard deviation in the other direction. All of them together are that 66.6 7 that Mike mentioned. Okay. But what if I just wanted to know 1 point?

895
01:47:13.090 --> 01:47:16.009
Anthony Taylor: How? What is? What is its measurement.

896
01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:20.060
Anthony Taylor: you know, and and we use z-score

897
01:47:20.460 --> 01:47:27.789
Anthony Taylor: to come up with that. So z-score is nothing more than a single data points distance from the mean

898
01:47:27.910 --> 01:47:32.620
Anthony Taylor: in terms of standard deviation. So

899
01:47:33.890 --> 01:47:39.030
Anthony Taylor: a Z score for something like this might be.

900
01:47:39.700 --> 01:47:40.880
Anthony Taylor: I don't know

901
01:47:40.990 --> 01:47:44.479
Anthony Taylor: point 2 standard deviations

902
01:47:45.860 --> 01:47:48.140
Anthony Taylor: right? It's not one one's over here.

903
01:47:49.180 --> 01:47:52.040
Anthony Taylor: So it's way over here. So it's like.

904
01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:56.900
Anthony Taylor: you know, barely any. But it is like a point 2 standard deviation.

905
01:47:57.060 --> 01:47:59.089
Anthony Taylor: something like that. Okay.

906
01:47:59.370 --> 01:48:09.519
Anthony Taylor: and again, since standard deviation. Now, Z. Scores are measured in standard deviation, standard deviations are measured in the unit of measure. So if you're unit to measure his feed

907
01:48:09.690 --> 01:48:16.300
Anthony Taylor: and and say, one standard deviation is 12 feet, your Z score is 0 point 5.

908
01:48:18.890 --> 01:48:21.349
Anthony Taylor: Your point is at 6 feet.

909
01:48:21.820 --> 01:48:35.080
Anthony Taylor: Got it? Make sense again, we have calculations for all of this. This is how it's calculated. It was z-cores negative. That means the data point is less than the mean. If it's positive, it's

910
01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:47.209
Anthony Taylor: more than the mean in that bell curve that's right and left right is negative, that's positive.  the smaller the Z score, the closer it is to the center, to the mean.

911
01:48:48.790 --> 01:48:51.290
Anthony Taylor: which. No. alright.

912
01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:53.530
Anthony Taylor: I think that's it.

913
01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:55.379
Anthony Taylor: Wait what we got here?

914
01:48:56.890 --> 01:49:04.530
Anthony Taylor: Oh, okay. So to calculate these, we're going to use numpy to get variance and standard deviation. And we're going to use sci pi

915
01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:07.459
Anthony Taylor: to get z-score. We're gonna do all of this

916
01:49:08.070 --> 01:49:09.029
Anthony Taylor: right now.

917
01:49:09.850 --> 01:49:15.140
Anthony Taylor: So that was kind of a lot of information. Any questions on that before we start like really calculating it.

918
01:49:15.850 --> 01:49:27.329
Baro, Sonja: It's it's not as bad as it sounds, I promise Anthony, mine's my questions are more on, not the how, but the value of all this, is it identify?

919
01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:29.840
Baro, Sonja: Well, it's just basically

920
01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:44.069
Baro, Sonja: this whole thing's around exploring our data, right variation. And and what we have in our data is the these specific values and equations to give us a sense of

921
01:49:44.250 --> 01:49:50.720
Baro, Sonja: confidence in the variation or variability within the data set. Or, yes. okay.

922
01:49:50.880 --> 01:50:10.069
Anthony Taylor: So when we started doing like the machine learning stuff and stuff like that. Understanding our data is is key if our data is highly variable, that might mean it might be better for machine learning model. Or maybe it's 2 variable

923
01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:20.060
Anthony Taylor: right? There's too much. But really, where we're heading is to also with, like the variances and the standard deviations. We're also trying to find outliers.

924
01:50:21.100 --> 01:50:25.809
Anthony Taylor: Okay, outliers can drastically affect machine learning models.

925
01:50:26.310 --> 01:50:37.039
Anthony Taylor: So we wanna be able to deal with them. So we need to identify these things. So that as we're building out our machine learning models it, it makes a little more sense.

926
01:50:37.490 --> 01:50:39.070
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But

927
01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:51.109
Anthony Taylor: use a a. And I'm just gonna again. I always like to tell you guys how we work. Okay. Now, I work

928
01:50:51.230 --> 01:50:58.390
Anthony Taylor: not so much here at Arthrex, but in the past with lots of data scientists. Okay,

929
01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:00.480
Anthony Taylor: And do they do this?

930
01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:01.850
No.

931
01:51:02.150 --> 01:51:03.969
Anthony Taylor: okay. But

932
01:51:04.300 --> 01:51:12.080
Anthony Taylor: they'll start building models. And if things don't feel right or aren't working the way they expect they will come back to this.

933
01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:18.069
Anthony Taylor: So most of the time, do we actually start with this rudimentary change checks? Not really.

934
01:51:18.370 --> 01:51:30.780
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if I'm being real, we don't, I mean, you know. But again, if they start doing a machine learning model, and it's like man, I can't get a good score. Or I wonder what's going on with my data.

935
01:51:31.110 --> 01:51:32.339
Anthony Taylor: Guess where they go

936
01:51:32.590 --> 01:51:41.970
Anthony Taylor: all the way back to Alright. Let's check standard deviations. Let's check all of the summary statistics and see. So I mean, should they do it at the beginning, probably.

937
01:51:42.390 --> 01:51:43.360
Anthony Taylor: do we?

938
01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:54.250
Anthony Taylor:  And I mean, I don't know. I haven't seen this have to go back very often. but sometimes it does happen

939
01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:58.190
Anthony Taylor: especially, and then let me throw this out there as students.

940
01:51:58.420 --> 01:52:11.630
Anthony Taylor: You will run into that more often than we do in the field. because in the field we are already are dealing with data. We're already cleaning the data before we bring it in. So through that alone, we have a good idea what we're looking for

941
01:52:11.730 --> 01:52:23.009
Anthony Taylor: and what we have. As students. You guys are pulling data from God knows where. and and then you go do it, and then oh, if you didn't follow the steps then, now you're maybe all over the place.

942
01:52:23.220 --> 01:52:24.470
Anthony Taylor: So anyway.

943
01:52:25.350 --> 01:52:26.670
Anthony Taylor: that was a long answer.

944
01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:28.130
Anthony Taylor: Magnets of human.

945
01:52:29.450 --> 01:52:42.950
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. So we have some new libraries. Numpy scipi dot stats. Okay. do you have to use these aliases. No, I will tell you pretty much. Everybody on the planet uses these aliases.

946
01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:47.870
Anthony Taylor: So it's up to you. It's just easier to remember if you use the same way. Everybody else is

947
01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:59.080
Anthony Taylor:  So we're going to read in a Csv file. And we're going to create something

948
01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:03.000
Anthony Taylor: called temperatures

949
01:53:04.110 --> 01:53:07.480
Anthony Taylor: that should give you a hint that I'm going to ask you what it is.

950
01:53:12.100 --> 01:53:15.679
Anthony Taylor: What is that? What data type is this

951
01:53:17.820 --> 01:53:18.850
Baro, Sonja: series

952
01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:21.989
Anthony Taylor: series? What data type are the values.

953
01:53:26.740 --> 01:53:31.740
Baro, Sonja:  integers, integers. It says, so right there.

954
01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:36.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it also gives us the link, 3,529

955
01:53:36.590 --> 01:53:43.619
Anthony Taylor: values. So we have 3,529 temperature values in this data in this data frame.

956
01:53:44.100 --> 01:53:48.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so what are we gonna do? Well, first, we're gonna calculate the mean Median mode.

957
01:53:49.150 --> 01:53:54.849
Anthony Taylor: Notice what we got here in P mean, numpy mean Sn, our series.

958
01:53:55.070 --> 01:54:01.700
Anthony Taylor: Which effectively a series numpy will treat a series like an array.

959
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:08.029
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so remember how I told you before. A series is like a list, really.

960
01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:15.449
Anthony Taylor: and a list and an array are effectively the same thing. I know it's like, why don't you just call it that? Well.

961
01:54:15.730 --> 01:54:16.729
Anthony Taylor: because we don't

962
01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:20.489
Anthony Taylor: so when we pass in a series.

963
01:54:20.750 --> 01:54:24.479
Anthony Taylor: it's going to treat it like an array. So it gets the average.

964
01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:29.870
Anthony Taylor: It gets the median, and then we use our Scipi

965
01:54:29.900 --> 01:54:35.439
Anthony Taylor: to get the most. and that's it. And then we're going to print each of those out, so you can see what they look like.

966
01:54:35.980 --> 01:54:48.290
Anthony Taylor: Like the magic. The the mean is 57.6. The median is 57, and the mode. Now the mode is interesting because the mode returns

967
01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:51.240
Anthony Taylor: this odd-looking result.

968
01:54:52.590 --> 01:54:59.039
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this result is telling me that there are 327

969
01:54:59.570 --> 01:55:01.429
Anthony Taylor: records in this

970
01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:06.900
Anthony Taylor: 3,529 that are of the value. 57.

971
01:55:09.210 --> 01:55:15.850
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so that's that's what this is telling, which kind of makes sense when you see that the average is, in fact

972
01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:25.199
Anthony Taylor: well, the average is 57.6, and the median is 57. This kind of makes sense. So all 3 of these are probably equally

973
01:55:25.390 --> 01:55:27.600
Anthony Taylor: showing us the center of our data.

974
01:55:28.110 --> 01:55:29.630
Anthony Taylor: Everyone agree.

975
01:55:30.150 --> 01:55:35.390
Anthony Taylor: Let's see what the variability is of our data. So we can do our variance.

976
01:55:35.460 --> 01:55:40.850
Anthony Taylor: which is 32.3 3. Now 32.3 3 sounds like a lot.

977
01:55:42.090 --> 01:55:48.369
Anthony Taylor: Alright. But remember, that is not temperature this. All these values are are in Fahrenheit.

978
01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:53.420
Anthony Taylor: Okay, the standard deviation. This value

979
01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:56.049
Anthony Taylor: is in temperature.

980
01:55:56.120 --> 01:56:02.750
Anthony Taylor: So this is in Fahrenheit, which means that when we look at all of our temperatures right here.

981
01:56:03.510 --> 01:56:09.060
Anthony Taylor: the standard deviation between them is approximately 5 degrees.

982
01:56:10.180 --> 01:56:19.740
Anthony Taylor: which, when you think about it. makes a lot of sense lot, more sense than 33 degrees 32 degrees. And that would be extreme.

983
01:56:20.930 --> 01:56:24.709
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so our variability is kind of low.

984
01:56:25.610 --> 01:56:36.880
Baro, Sonja: That would be Colorado weather 70 to 20 degrees within a day. Sorry.

985
01:56:36.930 --> 01:56:45.000
Anthony Taylor: but but that tells us, see what? Why is that important? Because that tells us something. LA weather is very consistent.

986
01:56:45.610 --> 01:56:50.540
Anthony Taylor: right? San Diego, I believe, is considered the most consistent weather

987
01:56:51.230 --> 01:56:52.360
Anthony Taylor: in all country.

988
01:56:52.870 --> 01:57:04.100
Anthony Taylor: It's like average, you know, 74 degrees 365 days of the year.  you know, and and most of Southern California is that way. I lived there for a long time.

989
01:57:04.350 --> 01:57:08.619
Anthony Taylor: Okay, most other places are gonna have a much higher variance.

990
01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:12.889
Anthony Taylor: That tells us something about our data and what we're looking at.

991
01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:24.259
Anthony Taylor: anyway. So here we're going to get the Z-score. We're using the Sci-fi library again. And this is the Z score for every single point. So

992
01:57:25.110 --> 01:57:26.710
Anthony Taylor: this is

993
01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:34.939
Anthony Taylor: negative. 1.1 7 standard deviations

994
01:57:35.770 --> 01:57:37.300
Anthony Taylor: from the mean.

995
01:57:38.500 --> 01:57:43.119
Anthony Taylor: Now, truthfully, we know what the mean was right, 57.6.

996
01:57:43.580 --> 01:57:51.300
Anthony Taylor: We know what the standard deviation was 5.6, so you could look at this and go. Well, it's 5

997
01:57:51.310 --> 01:58:01.029
Anthony Taylor: point 1 7. So you know, what is that? Maybe 6 degrees off the mean negative. And since the mean was 57. This first value is

998
01:58:01.070 --> 01:58:03.440
Anthony Taylor: probably around 51. Well, let's go look

999
01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:07.590
Anthony Taylor: 52. So I was close.

1000
01:58:08.590 --> 01:58:12.190
Anthony Taylor: Okay, does that make sense to everybody what we just did there.

1001
01:58:13.370 --> 01:58:14.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1002
01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:24.730
Anthony Taylor: can you just repeat that? Sure, of course, of course. Of course. So the Z score is measured in standard deviations. This is our standard deviation.

1003
01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:34.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we said, negative 1, 7 standard deviations from the mean. Oh, actually, oh, you know what? Look at that.

1004
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:36.449
I might have been right.

1005
01:58:37.190 --> 01:58:47.849
Anthony Taylor: because this is the 0. The 0 row is up here. So then we so you could basically multiply 5.6 by negative 1.1 7. And you're going to get

1006
01:58:48.430 --> 01:58:50.030
Anthony Taylor: basically

1007
01:58:51.180 --> 01:58:53.099
Anthony Taylor: like, I said, like 6 degrees.

1008
01:58:53.310 --> 01:58:58.229
Anthony Taylor: okay, so 6 degrees, our mean.

1009
01:58:58.680 --> 01:59:03.410
Anthony Taylor: we calculated right? Here is 57.6.

1010
01:59:03.630 --> 01:59:12.540
Anthony Taylor: Since this was a negative, we can subtract that 6 degrees from here, and we get like 51.6 degrees. That's

1011
01:59:12.930 --> 01:59:24.250
Anthony Taylor: I'm calculating backwards to see if I got it right. So now we can go and look, and as you can see. the row we were actually looking at was this one, and it was, in fact, 51 degrees.

1012
01:59:25.390 --> 01:59:32.349
Anthony Taylor: And this is the way to backwards. I mean, it's really just so you, I'm trying to help you guys understand the values and how they relate to one another.

1013
01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:33.880
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1014
01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:36.250
Anthony Taylor: okay.

1015
01:59:37.390 --> 01:59:40.390
Anthony Taylor: alright. And then, finally, what is this?

1016
01:59:41.230 --> 01:59:48.500
Anthony Taylor: Oh, so here we're going to. This is, remember, this is the original data frame way back at the beginning.

1017
01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:55.149
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're going to add a new column called Z-score. And we're going to pass in

1018
01:59:55.280 --> 02:00:00.009
Anthony Taylor: this this series. Because, remember, a series is just

1019
02:00:00.810 --> 02:00:08.060
Anthony Taylor: a column in Pandas. Right? So we're going to pass in this series. And it's going to create a brand new

1020
02:00:08.360 --> 02:00:14.450
Anthony Taylor: column, showing us the Z-score of every value. And we're going to take a look at it. And there it is.

1021
02:00:16.060 --> 02:00:16.900
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1022
02:00:18.460 --> 02:00:19.640
Anthony Taylor: Is that pretty cool.

1023
02:00:21.580 --> 02:00:23.360
Anthony Taylor: How you guys feeling about this?

1024
02:00:25.050 --> 02:00:26.100
Anthony Taylor: Pretty good.

1025
02:00:26.740 --> 02:00:30.490
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And it's okay. If you're just kinda like,

1026
02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:37.259
Anthony Taylor: it's okay. This is statistics. This is not again, we have functions to do all this. So

1027
02:00:38.570 --> 02:00:43.039
Anthony Taylor: yeah. alright. okay, I'm not done lecturing, though. I got one more.

1028
02:00:44.460 --> 02:00:47.089
Anthony Taylor: Let's talk about outliers.

1029
02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:51.039
Anthony Taylor: So one of the primary reasons we do. All of this

1030
02:00:51.390 --> 02:00:58.010
Anthony Taylor: is to get is to see if we have some bad data that we need to take a look at.

1031
02:00:58.300 --> 02:01:00.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So

1032
02:01:00.370 --> 02:01:05.850
Anthony Taylor: some of the things we're gonna look at are we gonna talk about now? More definitions. a quantile.

1033
02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:09.439
Anthony Taylor: a quartile, a percentile

1034
02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:16.619
Anthony Taylor: and an outlier. So I'm gonna make this super easy. A Quantile

1035
02:01:16.730 --> 02:01:21.520
Anthony Taylor: is nothing more than a division of your data that is equal.

1036
02:01:22.510 --> 02:01:23.380
Anthony Taylor: So

1037
02:01:23.590 --> 02:01:29.210
Anthony Taylor: you can have a quantile. That's a hundred quantiles, and you have

1038
02:01:29.910 --> 02:01:31.729
Anthony Taylor: 100 divisions of your data.

1039
02:01:32.090 --> 02:01:36.479
Anthony Taylor: no matter how much data is there divided by a hundred different sections.

1040
02:01:37.090 --> 02:01:48.430
Anthony Taylor: the most common ones that we're gonna deal with is a quartile. So what's a quartile 0 25%,

1041
02:01:48.570 --> 02:01:51.979
Anthony Taylor: 50%, 75%

1042
02:01:52.060 --> 02:01:54.859
Anthony Taylor: 100%. So think orders.

1043
02:01:55.590 --> 02:01:57.899
Anthony Taylor: quartile is quarters.

1044
02:01:59.170 --> 02:02:02.799
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're all. We're all. None of us are Canadian. Right? Okay? Good.

1045
02:02:03.330 --> 02:02:05.190
A percentile

1046
02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:07.030
Anthony Taylor: is dimes.

1047
02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:13.509
Anthony Taylor: 1020, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 9,000

1048
02:02:14.550 --> 02:02:16.969
Anthony Taylor: percentiles of dimes.

1049
02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:20.520
Anthony Taylor: Okay, outliers.

1050
02:02:20.580 --> 02:02:26.370
Anthony Taylor: We're going to come up with. I'm gonna show you a formula in a minute that you

1051
02:02:26.380 --> 02:02:28.390
Anthony Taylor: kind of will want to remember

1052
02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:32.770
Anthony Taylor: and it's gonna say everything.

1053
02:02:34.050 --> 02:02:46.170
Anthony Taylor: A certain distance beyond the 20 fifth quartile and the 70 fifth quartile. we're going to say, is an outlier and all an outlier is is something that is not

1054
02:02:46.230 --> 02:02:50.079
Anthony Taylor: in the middle of all the data. most of the data.

1055
02:02:50.250 --> 02:02:53.299
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so let's look at what that looks like

1056
02:02:54.860 --> 02:03:01.789
Anthony Taylor: already described what that is and what that is. So the 50

1057
02:03:02.020 --> 02:03:04.750
Anthony Taylor: fertile is

1058
02:03:05.430 --> 02:03:13.340
Anthony Taylor: the middle of the data, right? Just like the 50% percentile would be the middle of the data.

1059
02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:14.670
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1060
02:03:15.010 --> 02:03:18.499
Anthony Taylor: outliers, we're gonna talk about that.

1061
02:03:18.620 --> 02:03:20.539
Anthony Taylor: So when you look at this.

1062
02:03:20.770 --> 02:03:24.129
Anthony Taylor: okay, this is broken into

1063
02:03:24.490 --> 02:03:29.030
Anthony Taylor: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So it's actually.

1064
02:03:29.150 --> 02:03:38.830
Anthony Taylor: But here you got the one standard deviation, the 2 standard deviation. We're saying that anything beyond the second standard deviation could be an outlier.

1065
02:03:39.610 --> 02:03:52.119
Anthony Taylor: Here's the formula. And now we're gonna see it in different ways. But it's 1.5 times the IQ. R. The Iqr. In this example, is here

1066
02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:53.930
Anthony Taylor: to hear all of the blue.

1067
02:03:55.360 --> 02:04:05.940
Anthony Taylor: So we're saying 1.5 times this. So there's basically a standard deviation and a half outside of the Iqr. Or whatever that value is outside the I. Qi.

1068
02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:10.400
Anthony Taylor: so they're claiming those are outliers. I don't know if I agree.

1069
02:04:10.730 --> 02:04:14.850
Anthony Taylor: and and the key word here is potential

1070
02:04:15.190 --> 02:04:23.069
Anthony Taylor: outliers. I want you to make sure. You guys remember that statement. Anytime. You see, outliers, I want you to put in your head potential

1071
02:04:23.250 --> 02:04:24.410
Anthony Taylor: outliers.

1072
02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:34.939
Anthony Taylor: because not everything is an outlier, just because it's not amidst everybody else. Think about that for a second, in the, in the in, like, the whole

1073
02:04:35.490 --> 02:04:41.420
Anthony Taylor: like, you know, we talk about the ethics of AI and all this, and how it's biased, and all that stuff. But imagine

1074
02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:48.010
Anthony Taylor: if everything that fell outside of the norm was considered an outlier.

1075
02:04:50.010 --> 02:04:56.249
Anthony Taylor: I mean, that would be crazy. Right? There are smarter people. There are faster people. There are

1076
02:04:56.550 --> 02:05:06.709
Anthony Taylor: better, you know, there are things that fall out. In fact, if it wasn't for the fact that things can fall outside and not be outliers, we would never improve

1077
02:05:06.770 --> 02:05:10.880
Anthony Taylor: or nothing would ever degrade. Right? So

1078
02:05:10.990 --> 02:05:17.859
Anthony Taylor: keep that in mind. Okay, so this is how we visually. And and I want to use another term. I have a lot of terminology. Today.

1079
02:05:18.030 --> 02:05:20.770
Anthony Taylor: we qualitatively

1080
02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:26.110
Anthony Taylor: demonstrate outliers with a box chart.

1081
02:05:27.150 --> 02:05:32.819
Anthony Taylor: We quantitatively do it with that function.

1082
02:05:34.100 --> 02:05:39.320
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And and all that means is is quantitative. We're gonna do it with numbers

1083
02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:51.049
Anthony Taylor: qualitative. We're gonna do it visually. that's all that. Okay? So I may ask, you may hear me ask you that sometime. Hey? How did you quantitatively show me that

1084
02:05:51.340 --> 02:05:55.109
Anthony Taylor: cause you're gonna do a visual. And I'm like, Yeah, whatever what's the numbers?

1085
02:05:56.320 --> 02:05:57.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

1086
02:05:57.660 --> 02:06:00.729
Anthony Taylor: So here's our box. This box

1087
02:06:01.610 --> 02:06:03.899
Anthony Taylor: is the IQR.

1088
02:06:05.630 --> 02:06:09.409
Anthony Taylor: Okay, the range between the first and third

1089
02:06:09.430 --> 02:06:10.470
Anthony Taylor: quartile.

1090
02:06:11.980 --> 02:06:16.040
Anthony Taylor: this box. that yellow line, is actually the mean.

1091
02:06:17.940 --> 02:06:27.699
Anthony Taylor: These tails or whiskers. Those are basically the indicator that anything above or below them is considered an outlier.

1092
02:06:30.260 --> 02:06:34.369
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So this is the qualitative version. And here's the math to do it.

1093
02:06:34.890 --> 02:06:43.399
Anthony Taylor: Okay, 1.5 times I, QR, so this area in here, or 1.5 times I QR, the other direction.

1094
02:06:44.180 --> 02:06:51.219
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so what they're doing here. This one minus and 3 plus what they're saying is is anything

1095
02:06:51.470 --> 02:06:58.089
Anthony Taylor: that is one minus this. I, QR is going to fall into this down here.

1096
02:06:58.380 --> 02:07:03.369
Anthony Taylor: This yellow area. Anything that is 3 plus this formula

1097
02:07:03.410 --> 02:07:05.360
Anthony Taylor: will fall in above

1098
02:07:05.390 --> 02:07:08.790
Anthony Taylor: and would be a potential

1099
02:07:08.980 --> 02:07:11.510
Anthony Taylor: follow fire. Okay.

1100
02:07:12.990 --> 02:07:13.780
Anthony Taylor: okay.

1101
02:07:14.800 --> 02:07:21.319
Anthony Taylor: do not get stressed about. I can. I can just feel it in my bones right now that people are like, I don't get

1102
02:07:21.480 --> 02:07:22.200
Anthony Taylor: but

1103
02:07:22.600 --> 02:07:27.020
Anthony Taylor: just hang in there. Okay, alright. So we're gonna import pandas.

1104
02:07:28.380 --> 02:07:32.370
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna read it in our file. And we're going to look at

1105
02:07:32.490 --> 02:07:35.920
Anthony Taylor: hourly dry bulb temperature.

1106
02:07:35.970 --> 02:07:37.080
What? That is.

1107
02:07:38.490 --> 02:07:44.470
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So here's the first thing we're gonna do is get our quantiles.

1108
02:07:44.700 --> 02:07:58.719
Anthony Taylor: And with those well. let me restate that the first thing we're gonna do is get our quartiles. But we're going to use the quantile method. So why do we do that? Remember, a Quantile is an equal division of our data.

1109
02:07:59.030 --> 02:08:06.510
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna say, I want you to run Quantile and give me 25.2 5, which will give us 25%

1110
02:08:07.350 --> 02:08:10.140
Anthony Taylor: quantile one got it.

1111
02:08:10.290 --> 02:08:21.560
Anthony Taylor: The median could be done a couple of ways, but they're going to use Quantile point 5, and then for the 3 quarter one, we're gonna do Quantile point 7 5.

1112
02:08:22.100 --> 02:08:25.400
Anthony Taylor: Recall from our visual

1113
02:08:25.810 --> 02:08:27.659
Anthony Taylor: that that box chart.

1114
02:08:29.430 --> 02:08:30.829
Anthony Taylor: this right here.

1115
02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:36.300
Anthony Taylor: This is the distance between the first and third

1116
02:08:36.710 --> 02:08:37.650
Anthony Taylor: fertile.

1117
02:08:40.350 --> 02:08:43.039
Anthony Taylor: Q. 3 minus q, one.

1118
02:08:43.950 --> 02:08:46.740
Anthony Taylor: That gives you that value.

1119
02:08:46.920 --> 02:08:50.970
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so that becomes your your I. QR.

1120
02:08:52.770 --> 02:08:58.319
Anthony Taylor: Once we have the I. QR. Now we can calculate the outliers.

1121
02:08:58.390 --> 02:09:02.390
Anthony Taylor: So first, we're going to return. First quartile is this third quartile is this

1122
02:09:02.470 --> 02:09:07.049
Anthony Taylor: intercortile range? Is Iqr. And the median is this.

1123
02:09:07.450 --> 02:09:10.639
Anthony Taylor: Now we're going to get the lower bound. What's the lower bound

1124
02:09:12.220 --> 02:09:13.229
back to my picture.

1125
02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:15.319
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna get this area.

1126
02:09:16.530 --> 02:09:18.180
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And that's

1127
02:09:18.620 --> 02:09:20.489
Anthony Taylor: this right here.

1128
02:09:22.300 --> 02:09:25.640
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna say. well, Q, one

1129
02:09:26.060 --> 02:09:33.250
Anthony Taylor: ordered quartile one minus 1.5 times. Whatever the Iqr value is

1130
02:09:34.460 --> 02:09:41.990
Anthony Taylor: anything that is lower than this number is considered. A potential outlier

1131
02:09:43.290 --> 02:09:47.110
Anthony Taylor: upper is exactly the opposite. We're going to go to quartile 3

1132
02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:55.980
Anthony Taylor: and add it to this. Anything that is above this number is a potential outlier.

1133
02:09:56.580 --> 02:09:58.130
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So let's run this

1134
02:09:59.910 --> 02:10:06.779
Anthony Taylor: so we can see for the weather, for those temperatures. 54 was our lower quartile. 60 was our upper.

1135
02:10:07.490 --> 02:10:18.800
Anthony Taylor: Our interquartile range is only 6. That's not very high. Our Median was 57, so it says, anything below 45 degrees in Los Angeles

1136
02:10:19.660 --> 02:10:28.500
Anthony Taylor: is potentially an outlook. Anything above 69 degrees could also be an outlier

1137
02:10:28.890 --> 02:10:33.359
Anthony Taylor: now, just so, you guys know, I lived in Los Angeles for a long time.

1138
02:10:33.950 --> 02:10:36.759
Anthony Taylor: and it often gets above 69.

1139
02:10:37.060 --> 02:10:40.489
Anthony Taylor: However, I don't know when this data was captured. So

1140
02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:46.550
Anthony Taylor: and the closer you are to the beach the cooler it is most of the time.

1141
02:10:46.620 --> 02:10:48.130
Anthony Taylor: So it is possible.

1142
02:10:48.570 --> 02:10:55.109
Anthony Taylor: anyway. So this calculated all this stuff out? No, this is all just methods other than

1143
02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:58.729
Anthony Taylor: this. And this little function here.

1144
02:10:58.790 --> 02:11:11.810
Anthony Taylor: this is all just just methods that you guys have to remember. Okay. last, but not least. So we got our 45 and our 60. Let's pull the data out

1145
02:11:12.530 --> 02:11:16.870
Anthony Taylor: where it's less than 45, and greater than 69.

1146
02:11:17.310 --> 02:11:26.889
Anthony Taylor: Which would mean all of our potential outliers. Right? Because that's what we said. It's less than 45. It's potentially an outlier. It's greater than this. It's

1147
02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:30.520
Anthony Taylor: potentially an outlier. So let's run this.

1148
02:11:31.010 --> 02:11:36.730
Anthony Taylor: We can see some of the examples. We've got some 43 s. We got a 70. Okay.

1149
02:11:37.070 --> 02:11:45.020
Anthony Taylor: we can actually do a count on that our length on that data frame and see how many we have 153 out potential

1150
02:11:45.180 --> 02:11:46.240
Anthony Taylor: outliers.

1151
02:11:46.290 --> 02:11:47.950
Anthony Taylor: Yes, Marilyn.

1152
02:11:48.650 --> 02:11:50.999
Meredith McCanse (she/her): in the the

1153
02:11:51.070 --> 02:11:53.280
Meredith McCanse (she/her): formula above this, where we did the

1154
02:11:53.480 --> 02:12:01.420
Meredith McCanse (she/her): 40 less than 45, over 69. Yup Yup is the pipe serving as like an and

1155
02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:08.880
Anthony Taylor: oh, I'm sorry. This is an or yeah, this first time you guys seen that. Huh? Thank you for pointing that out

1156
02:12:09.170 --> 02:12:12.450
Anthony Taylor: correct. So we're saying this condition

1157
02:12:12.490 --> 02:12:15.430
Anthony Taylor: or this condition.

1158
02:12:17.260 --> 02:12:24.410
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so that's why we can do greater, less than 45, or greater than 69. It's not really an and can't be both.

1159
02:12:24.510 --> 02:12:25.840
Anthony Taylor: That wouldn't be possible.

1160
02:12:27.330 --> 02:12:28.040
Anthony Taylor: Right?

1161
02:12:29.080 --> 02:12:32.709
Anthony Taylor: So I know that. Felt like a lot. It probably felt kind of hard.

1162
02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:36.160
Anthony Taylor: Don't don't get too worked up on this.

1163
02:12:36.290 --> 02:12:40.220
Anthony Taylor: Keep this sample nearby. It'll always be the same.

1164
02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:45.359
Anthony Taylor: Okay. The only thing it's gonna change is the numbers that gets fed in from your data.

1165
02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:49.810
Anthony Taylor: and this will always well.

1166
02:12:49.830 --> 02:12:54.760
Anthony Taylor: the the printouts, of course, like, if it's not temperatures, I mean. it's be dark

1167
02:12:56.070 --> 02:13:05.960
Anthony Taylor: millimeters, or whatever. Obviously, that's gonna change. But effectively, it's the same calculation. No matter what your data is.

1168
02:13:06.970 --> 02:13:08.670
Anthony Taylor: you're going to do the same thing.

1169
02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:14.830
Anthony Taylor: So just a real world moment.

1170
02:13:15.450 --> 02:13:18.580
Anthony Taylor: Okay, would 70 really be

1171
02:13:19.300 --> 02:13:20.590
Anthony Taylor: an outlier?

1172
02:13:22.100 --> 02:13:25.720
Anthony Taylor: No, see? Gabe, Gabe's got it. It's not really an outlier.

1173
02:13:25.870 --> 02:13:32.630
Anthony Taylor: It's a potential outlier, quantitatively speaking, is it an outlier. Yes. but

1174
02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:38.870
Anthony Taylor: we would not eliminate it. If we were doing a model on this, we absolutely would not eliminate that.

1175
02:13:39.150 --> 02:13:42.530
Anthony Taylor: It's not extreme. If it was like a hundred 20,

1176
02:13:43.140 --> 02:13:46.080
Anthony Taylor: probably an outlier. Something weird is going on.

1177
02:13:46.700 --> 02:13:50.550
Anthony Taylor: Okay. It's either bad data or just something really bizarre happened.

1178
02:13:51.300 --> 02:13:58.159
Anthony Taylor: Okay? I would say the same in other direction. If it was. you know, 20 degrees

1179
02:13:58.690 --> 02:14:01.970
Anthony Taylor: at Lax, that would be really unusual.

1180
02:14:02.660 --> 02:14:04.970
Anthony Taylor: Maybe it's out there.

1181
02:14:06.270 --> 02:14:07.900
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. okay.

1182
02:14:08.030 --> 02:14:11.639
Anthony Taylor: alright. So it does take some thought to do that

1183
02:14:11.790 --> 02:14:19.799
Anthony Taylor: alright last, and we would probably won't do the pandas recap it was just. It's just there in case we have time.

1184
02:14:20.020 --> 02:14:23.960
Anthony Taylor:  So let's

1185
02:14:24.950 --> 02:14:32.799
Anthony Taylor: so you're gonna go. Do this in the next 15 min. Calculate the meet median and mode for cups of coffee, consume daily.

1186
02:14:33.110 --> 02:14:35.380
Anthony Taylor: create a histogram. What's

1187
02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:37.879
Anthony Taylor: you do not have to do?

1188
02:14:38.490 --> 02:14:45.769
Anthony Taylor: You know what? Let's just make this and everyone do. because if they're gonna ask you to do something you've never done before, and we'll be ticked.

1189
02:14:46.260 --> 02:14:50.069
Natalie Mason: I like everyone these.

1190
02:14:50.100 --> 02:14:56.699
Anthony Taylor: I know. I get that a lot, every class. Honest to God, I get that. Everyone's like, Oh, everyone do. Yeah.

1191
02:14:57.400 --> 02:15:01.550
Natalie Mason: I know. But it's fun. I like the breakout rooms, too, but

1192
02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:08.200
Anthony Taylor: I know. But it's good to get you guys in there and make you work through brainstorm. Yeah.

1193
02:15:09.160 --> 02:15:14.539
Anthony Taylor: especially, we have a nicely distributed class right now, where we have enough people

1194
02:15:14.590 --> 02:15:17.689
Anthony Taylor: that have some experience where they can kind of

1195
02:15:17.700 --> 02:15:20.059
Anthony Taylor: work with the ones that maybe don't.

1196
02:15:20.150 --> 02:15:25.069
Anthony Taylor: And it's it's a pretty nice and basically, like, you know, free tas.

1197
02:15:26.450 --> 02:15:36.250
Natalie Mason: yeah, everybody with this with experience, has been extraordinarily helpful. And I appreciate all of you, which is what it's all about guys. That's why we're here

1198
02:15:36.660 --> 02:15:39.810
Anthony Taylor: is to help each other out, because eventually.

1199
02:15:39.980 --> 02:15:42.430
Anthony Taylor: yeah, here's the I will say this

1200
02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:49.950
Anthony Taylor: one of my one of my students. This was years ago now. but he he was so ballsy.

1201
02:15:50.450 --> 02:15:52.500
Anthony Taylor: I guess that's probably not the right thing.

1202
02:15:52.630 --> 02:15:55.689
Anthony Taylor: He was very determined.

1203
02:15:55.960 --> 02:15:57.080
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1204
02:15:57.240 --> 02:16:03.499
Anthony Taylor: and when he left here he started applying it everywhere, everywhere.

1205
02:16:03.660 --> 02:16:09.560
Anthony Taylor: He even applied at my company. We were a consulting firm. right? We only hired

1206
02:16:09.610 --> 02:16:12.419
Anthony Taylor: like people with years of experience.

1207
02:16:12.730 --> 02:16:14.650
Anthony Taylor: but he applied. He got an interview

1208
02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:22.740
Anthony Taylor: for my company, and he had never worked in the field before. They, of course, told him, yeah, you're not gonna work here. But they interviewed

1209
02:16:23.050 --> 02:16:32.549
Anthony Taylor: anyway, the moral of the story is, he wasn't a top student. He was a good student, and he got a great job at cognizant in California.

1210
02:16:32.740 --> 02:16:37.879
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Since then he has hired like 5 other

1211
02:16:39.809 --> 02:16:41.260
Anthony Taylor: boot camp students.

1212
02:16:42.770 --> 02:16:54.659
Anthony Taylor: right? Because he did it. So you don't know who's gonna be the one that gets that job right? You may be great at Python, but maybe it's going to be one of the lunch students that aren't as great

1213
02:16:54.770 --> 02:16:58.219
Anthony Taylor: at Python that get the gig, and you know.

1214
02:16:58.340 --> 02:17:00.940
Anthony Taylor: So it's good to help your your neighbors

1215
02:17:01.420 --> 02:17:09.420
Anthony Taylor: is the moral of that story. Okay? So we're gonna import numpy pandas flatly expressed. So they are, gonna have you? That's so weird.

1216
02:17:09.540 --> 02:17:12.060
Anthony Taylor: I probably don't even have that. Let's see.

1217
02:17:15.570 --> 02:17:21.969
Anthony Taylor: you may not have this. If you don't, we're gonna have to pip, install it right. So how do we do that? Well, I'm going to create a code cell.

1218
02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:25.680
Anthony Taylor: But type, hit, install, plot, lead.

1219
02:17:27.340 --> 02:17:28.360
Anthony Taylor: run that

1220
02:17:34.110 --> 02:17:35.279
take forever.

1221
02:17:35.709 --> 02:17:38.850
Anthony Taylor: Really have 9 min. Jupiter.

1222
02:17:40.270 --> 02:17:47.470
Anthony Taylor: it's just because I'm on my little laptop, this laptop. It's one of those like HP touch screen laptops. It's like this big.

1223
02:17:50.889 --> 02:17:53.589
Anthony Taylor: But it does really good when I'm traveling.

1224
02:17:54.930 --> 02:17:58.370
Anthony Taylor: except for right now it's taken a really long time.

1225
02:18:01.650 --> 02:18:03.330
Anthony Taylor: It will finish eventually.

1226
02:18:07.230 --> 02:18:10.020
Anthony Taylor: Well, we can keep reviewing the code while we wait.

1227
02:18:10.799 --> 02:18:17.419
Anthony Taylor:  So next thing we're do, we're gonna we have this cool array of cups of coffee.

1228
02:18:17.820 --> 02:18:23.779
Anthony Taylor: and we're going to create a data frame from it. And we're going to call the the one column in the data frame

1229
02:18:24.030 --> 02:18:26.260
Anthony Taylor: cups. That's exciting.

1230
02:18:26.930 --> 02:18:34.750
Anthony Taylor:  and we're gonna start calculating. So what were the things that said me Median mode, which

1231
02:18:36.049 --> 02:18:38.949
Anthony Taylor: which library do we do for me?

1232
02:18:42.459 --> 02:18:45.850
Anthony Taylor: Anybody remember? I

1233
02:18:46.139 --> 02:18:47.250
Anthony Taylor: very good.

1234
02:18:47.629 --> 02:18:55.219
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna do come. I understand why that is taking so long. It's really upsetting. Np, dot mean?

1235
02:18:55.250 --> 02:18:57.149
Anthony Taylor: And then we're just gonna pass in

1236
02:18:57.610 --> 02:19:04.859
Anthony Taylor: the name of our data frame. And we're gonna use what's called dot notation and ask for the cup

1237
02:19:04.959 --> 02:19:07.030
Anthony Taylor: column. So we're gonna say, coffee

1238
02:19:08.080 --> 02:19:10.020
Anthony Taylor: underscore consumed.

1239
02:19:13.930 --> 02:19:16.960
Anthony Taylor: And then dot cup. That's dot notation.

1240
02:19:17.969 --> 02:19:18.760
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

1241
02:19:19.420 --> 02:19:23.569
Anthony Taylor: And that are, is it cup or cups. What did they say?

1242
02:19:24.150 --> 02:19:25.840
Anthony Taylor: Cups? Not cup.

1243
02:19:26.930 --> 02:19:29.339
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this is just not right. Something is wrong.

1244
02:19:35.379 --> 02:19:36.990
Anthony Taylor: Did it work for anybody else?

1245
02:19:38.230 --> 02:19:42.430
Natalie Mason: Install it? It was just there.

1246
02:19:43.600 --> 02:19:45.690
Anthony Taylor: It actually says

1247
02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:53.899
Anthony Taylor: so bizarre. There it goes. Okay. Mine worked.

1248
02:19:54.240 --> 02:19:55.819
Anthony Taylor: Everybody else got it to work.

1249
02:19:55.960 --> 02:20:07.729
Anthony Taylor: Anybody stuck. Okay, good. Alright. So so now we can run this to get our data frame alright. So we have our mean instead. Do, Median, what library do we use for medium

1250
02:20:09.910 --> 02:20:11.010
Meredith McCanse (she/her): numpy

1251
02:20:11.710 --> 02:20:12.440
power?

1252
02:20:12.620 --> 02:20:24.600
Anthony Taylor: I don't know why I'm doing it this way isn't I always do my F strings. But that's not. This is how it is in the solution. So I want you guys to have it same. So it's coffee. Zoom, dot.

1253
02:20:42.860 --> 02:20:44.410
Anthony Taylor: yeah, in this case.

1254
02:20:45.870 --> 02:20:49.569
Anthony Taylor: So only when you're using data frames correct

1255
02:20:49.860 --> 02:20:51.509
Meredith McCanse (she/her): and not always.

1256
02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:54.420
Anthony Taylor: I said, it's one of those things.

1257
02:20:54.560 --> 02:20:57.489
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay, so comma. And then we're gonna do

1258
02:20:57.800 --> 02:21:02.030
Anthony Taylor: sts, dot mode and pass in the same thing.

1259
02:21:04.300 --> 02:21:05.000
Hello!

1260
02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:08.350
Anthony Taylor: Why is it not giving me my thing.

1261
02:21:10.380 --> 02:21:15.520
Anthony Taylor: I really like it when it gives you my auto stuff so we can run that now. And

1262
02:21:16.350 --> 02:21:18.180
Anthony Taylor: I called it Moaf.

1263
02:21:18.900 --> 02:21:20.889
Anthony Taylor: It's not move, it's moved.

1264
02:21:22.200 --> 02:21:27.800
Anthony Taylor: And then so we can see we have a mean of 1.4 median, a 2 point O, and

1265
02:21:28.710 --> 02:21:41.819
Anthony Taylor: we have 0 is the most common number, and there are 9 of them. Okay, alright. So here's the histogram. We haven't even begun to cover this yet. Kind of surprised they're having you do these. Wait.

1266
02:21:46.610 --> 02:21:47.680
Anthony Taylor: They're not

1267
02:21:50.930 --> 02:21:52.010
Anthony Taylor: okay.

1268
02:21:52.060 --> 02:21:53.960
Anthony Taylor: That's interesting.

1269
02:21:55.730 --> 02:22:04.939
Anthony Taylor: Huh? So it's not in the solution. Should just skip that. Just delete that sound. Hmm. It is gone. We're going to do that. But later.

1270
02:22:05.300 --> 02:22:11.999
Anthony Taylor: not today. Okay. So I didn't have to, I guess. Just told you not to do that. But anyway, alright. So California data

1271
02:22:13.800 --> 02:22:16.430
Anthony Taylor: definitely don't want to bring in visualizations today.

1272
02:22:16.610 --> 02:22:25.830
Anthony Taylor: That takes too long. Pandas died. And this is good. We're gonna read the file in our resources. So read Underscore Csv.

1273
02:22:26.090 --> 02:22:38.680
Anthony Taylor: and we need the path. So I'm going to do dot dot slash resources. And California. There we go. Okay.

1274
02:22:39.180 --> 02:22:45.609
Anthony Taylor: so have my data frame. Let's see how long it is.

1275
02:22:52.250 --> 02:22:54.410
Anthony Taylor: 3,000 rows very cool.

1276
02:22:54.700 --> 02:23:02.060
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So now it says, determine the most central tendency. Now for us to do that we need to get

1277
02:23:02.240 --> 02:23:08.479
Anthony Taylor: and it's on the population. So we need to get eat the each of those. So let's just

1278
02:23:13.070 --> 02:23:17.860
Anthony Taylor: population, and we'll do dot mean?

1279
02:23:18.590 --> 02:23:23.559
Anthony Taylor: So in in the data frame, we don't have to do all that other stuff we did up there. So we're just going to

1280
02:23:23.830 --> 02:23:25.690
Anthony Taylor: California data

1281
02:23:26.700 --> 02:23:28.190
Anthony Taylor: population

1282
02:23:29.370 --> 02:23:31.280
Anthony Taylor: medium.

1283
02:23:33.310 --> 02:23:34.410
Anthony Taylor: and then

1284
02:23:40.200 --> 02:23:42.030
Anthony Taylor:  no, no.

1285
02:23:46.380 --> 02:23:48.440
Anthony Taylor: But so let's take a look at what we get.

1286
02:23:49.830 --> 02:23:51.100
Anthony Taylor: We got

1287
02:23:52.800 --> 02:23:56.450
Anthony Taylor: only 2 values.

1288
02:24:00.900 --> 02:24:04.019
Anthony Taylor: It's like it didn't print one of them out.

1289
02:24:05.930 --> 02:24:09.480
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna put a print in front of each one of these to make sure we get something

1290
02:24:13.180 --> 02:24:15.539
Anthony Taylor: probably just means that there's

1291
02:24:18.740 --> 02:24:19.590
Anthony Taylor: and listen.

1292
02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:40.680
Derek Rikke:  there isn't only giving you money.

1293
02:24:41.200 --> 02:24:50.469
Anthony Taylor: I think, yeah, it's it's yeah, because we weren't printing it. It's yeah. We're missing one. So there it is. So yeah. So if you don't print it, it's only gonna give you the last thing it does

1294
02:24:51.050 --> 02:24:58.690
Anthony Taylor: alright. So our media, our mean was 1387, our Median, 1152. And we have a lot of zeros.

1295
02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:05.319
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Or or wait could be we have 1, 1, 2, 8.

1296
02:25:06.380 --> 02:25:08.940
Anthony Taylor: Now now we have

1297
02:25:08.980 --> 02:25:11.299
Anthony Taylor: 1, 1, 2, 8 is our mode.

1298
02:25:12.610 --> 02:25:16.670
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So now we need to do our outliers.

1299
02:25:16.950 --> 02:25:22.190
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so what do we have to do to do our outliers. What's the first thing we need to calculate

1300
02:25:25.830 --> 02:25:32.969
Baro, Sonja: the quantiles and quartiles perfect. Okay, this is going to take some typing. And we are that much time. So how about?

1301
02:25:33.840 --> 02:25:37.769
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to give you guys the code

1302
02:25:38.100 --> 02:25:42.319
Anthony Taylor: so that you can paste it in, and we'll all paste it in together that way. We don't have to

1303
02:25:43.130 --> 02:25:45.530
Anthony Taylor: what the beseezers

1304
02:25:45.830 --> 02:25:46.660
here we go

1305
02:25:47.690 --> 02:25:48.560
Anthony Taylor: copy.

1306
02:25:52.080 --> 02:25:54.349
Anthony Taylor: So I'm gonna put this in the live channel.

1307
02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:02.330
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So

1308
02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:12.090
Anthony Taylor: that's what I just gave you. Let's walk through it. So we're gonna grab from our data, the average occupancy column

1309
02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:21.800
Anthony Taylor: and put it in to a variable. Then we're going to get the first quartile, which is the the Quantile point 2 5,

1310
02:26:22.190 --> 02:26:27.780
Anthony Taylor: the average occupancy, which is quantile. I'm sorry. The Median, which is Quantile

1311
02:26:27.820 --> 02:26:29.090
Anthony Taylor: point 5,

1312
02:26:29.240 --> 02:26:37.700
Anthony Taylor: and the third Quantile, which is Quantile point 7 5 i. QR is Q. 3 minus Q. One.

1313
02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:41.089
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna print all that mess out

1314
02:26:42.370 --> 02:26:50.419
Anthony Taylor: and then do our lower bounds. Actually, here, I'm gonna split that. So that you guys can, we can run just the first part by itself.

1315
02:26:51.210 --> 02:26:56.330
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we can see, the lower is twofour. The upper is 3.2.

1316
02:26:56.500 --> 02:27:03.429
Anthony Taylor: The IQR is point 8 7, and the median is 2.8.

1317
02:27:03.940 --> 02:27:14.800
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So now that we have all of this, we can easily fill that stuff in. So this is gonna be 2.4 2 5 minus 1.5 times

1318
02:27:15.150 --> 02:27:17.950
Anthony Taylor:  point 8 7.

1319
02:27:18.330 --> 02:27:23.499
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then you know the or plus 1.5 times.

1320
02:27:23.520 --> 02:27:25.390
Anthony Taylor: So we can run this.

1321
02:27:25.470 --> 02:27:32.029
Anthony Taylor: You can see our bounds. So we have one is our lower bound and 4.6 is our upper bound

1322
02:27:33.050 --> 02:27:36.699
Anthony Taylor: alright. Any questions about how we came up with that?

1323
02:27:37.500 --> 02:27:47.179
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Will you explain the first? Will you explain the first line of that data where you did average occupancy. Are you creating? Are you doing?

1324
02:27:47.260 --> 02:27:49.920
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yeah, here, let me let me just

1325
02:27:51.010 --> 02:27:55.740
Anthony Taylor: Let's just let's just show it real quick what that looks like. So all we're doing is creating

1326
02:27:55.870 --> 02:27:57.290
Anthony Taylor: a series

1327
02:27:57.940 --> 02:28:01.350
Anthony Taylor: for us to do the math on. That's all.

1328
02:28:02.650 --> 02:28:06.629
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So we just pulled one column out of the data.

1329
02:28:07.170 --> 02:28:16.640
Anthony Taylor: And where did we see what the columns are? Do we even know what they are? Or we didn't actually go through them. So again, like, if you were doing it normal work.

1330
02:28:16.720 --> 02:28:19.529
Anthony Taylor: you would actually look at your file.

1331
02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:21.520
Anthony Taylor: And there's our file.

1332
02:28:21.790 --> 02:28:28.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we can see, we have median income housing, age, average room, average red room population.

1333
02:28:28.930 --> 02:28:30.320
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay? Got it.

1334
02:28:30.360 --> 02:28:32.129
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So

1335
02:28:32.460 --> 02:28:35.260
Anthony Taylor: the thing to keep in mind is that what we're doing today.

1336
02:28:35.420 --> 02:28:38.890
Anthony Taylor: where you would start way at the beginning.

1337
02:28:39.720 --> 02:28:50.390
Anthony Taylor: Okay, where we were doing like data types and counts and looking at the data. And this would be like one of the later steps in your exploration of the data

1338
02:28:50.600 --> 02:28:54.850
Anthony Taylor: we call this Eda exploratory data analysis.

1339
02:28:55.290 --> 02:29:01.200
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So anyway, so that's the column we decided to look at, for whatever reason.

1340
02:29:01.570 --> 02:29:03.640
Anthony Taylor: And then last.

1341
02:29:04.950 --> 02:29:10.139
Anthony Taylor: but not least, well, not quite last, but really, really close. Let's get our outliers

1342
02:29:10.810 --> 02:29:13.500
Anthony Taylor: outlier occupancy

1343
02:29:14.310 --> 02:29:19.019
Anthony Taylor: equals. And here's what we're gonna do at. Or so we're gonna look at our data.

1344
02:29:19.250 --> 02:29:26.390
Anthony Taylor: the California data we're going to use Loke square brackets. And inside of there we're going to pass in

1345
02:29:26.630 --> 02:29:33.310
Anthony Taylor:  average occupants the less than lower

1346
02:29:33.530 --> 02:29:37.490
Anthony Taylor: found. Because, remember, we just we just created a variable for that

1347
02:29:37.780 --> 02:29:41.850
Anthony Taylor: or the pipe. Everybody know where the pipe is on your keyboard.

1348
02:29:43.550 --> 02:29:44.619
Anthony Taylor: That's a trap.

1349
02:29:46.790 --> 02:29:49.600
Anthony Taylor: because it's in your classroom, Norms.

1350
02:29:51.630 --> 02:29:55.039
Anthony Taylor: But yes, it's right above your enter key on your keyboard.

1351
02:29:55.340 --> 02:29:56.929
Anthony Taylor: See it? The pipe?

1352
02:29:57.710 --> 02:29:59.800
Baro, Sonja: Oh.

1353
02:30:01.410 --> 02:30:02.190
Anthony Taylor: huh!

1354
02:30:02.410 --> 02:30:10.470
Anthony Taylor: It is a trap. I showed you that in the classroom norms. Okay, and then we'll print it out.

1355
02:30:11.050 --> 02:30:13.960
Anthony Taylor: See what that looks like. So we got quite a few.

1356
02:30:14.110 --> 02:30:15.400
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it looks like

1357
02:30:16.410 --> 02:30:19.850
Anthony Taylor: 100 rows of potential outliers.

1358
02:30:19.910 --> 02:30:31.760
Anthony Taylor: Last, but not least, we're just going to grab the minimum and the maximum  median income of our outliers.

1359
02:30:31.810 --> 02:30:35.419
Anthony Taylor: Which means we're gonna say, outlier going to print.

1360
02:30:35.770 --> 02:30:39.329
Anthony Taylor: Okay. I'm gonna use. F's. I don't I?

1361
02:30:40.620 --> 02:30:44.710
Anthony Taylor: The min is curly brackets.

1362
02:30:44.860 --> 02:30:47.360
Anthony Taylor: outlier occupancy.

1363
02:30:47.410 --> 02:30:52.599
Anthony Taylor:  the column we want to look at which was weed.

1364
02:30:53.080 --> 02:30:53.830
Anthony Taylor: Hmm.

1365
02:30:55.410 --> 02:30:56.880
Anthony Taylor: and

1366
02:30:58.940 --> 02:31:00.730
Anthony Taylor: dot min.

1367
02:31:04.980 --> 02:31:07.219
Anthony Taylor: And then last Prince

1368
02:31:07.600 --> 02:31:08.490
Anthony Taylor: F.

1369
02:31:08.790 --> 02:31:12.750
Anthony Taylor: Dang! I am way over, guys. I'm so sorry

1370
02:31:12.910 --> 02:31:18.710
Anthony Taylor: the Max is. and curly brackets.

1371
02:31:18.980 --> 02:31:23.370
Anthony Taylor: I hate it when it does this stupid thank you.

1372
02:31:24.650 --> 02:31:29.280
Anthony Taylor: I actually don't like a lot of that limiting that it does.

1373
02:31:29.490 --> 02:31:32.079
Anthony Taylor: Linting is when it tells you what it is

1374
02:31:32.590 --> 02:31:45.559
Anthony Taylor: above like when it gives you like the definition, it's it's not Max. And then we can run that. And there we go. Lowest outliers point 7 one. The highest is 15.

1375
02:31:46.890 --> 02:31:49.030
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so

1376
02:31:50.360 --> 02:31:53.119
Anthony Taylor: that's really it for today. But

1377
02:31:55.010 --> 02:32:00.250
Anthony Taylor: at least go through the definitions. I don't care if you guys can calculate this from today.

1378
02:32:00.310 --> 02:32:04.400
Anthony Taylor: but try to at least have those definitions more or less remembered.

1379
02:32:04.730 --> 02:32:09.799
Anthony Taylor: Okay, because you can always come back to this code.

1380
02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.349
Anthony Taylor: But you have to know what you're looking for

1381
02:32:13.830 --> 02:32:18.569
Anthony Taylor: alright. If you can't remember, I need to, you know, to get the IQR.

1382
02:32:19.380 --> 02:32:25.910
Anthony Taylor: Right then, if you don't remember what it is, you're not gonna know where to go find it. The code to do it? Alright.

1383
02:32:26.010 --> 02:32:32.549
Anthony Taylor: So that's really it. Guys, how do you guys? That last one was kind of rough there by kind of like out.

1384
02:32:33.320 --> 02:32:37.819
Anthony Taylor: No, maybe. Okay. Well, Jennifer, you're statistics person.

1385
02:32:39.300 --> 02:32:48.800
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Okay. I am done with lecture. Have a wonderful night. I will see you. Tomorrow we will be here for the next 30 min.
