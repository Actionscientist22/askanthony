1
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.950
Anthony Taylor: There it is. Welcome, everybody.

2
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.050
Anthony Taylor: L bp, day 2.

3
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.350
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna be honest with you today is really really a hard day.

4
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:28.680
Anthony Taylor: I know that's exciting, right? But hopefully it goes well before we get started. During office hours. A request came up about, you know, a day in the light.

5
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.860
Anthony Taylor: and and and here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna give you my date today.

6
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:42.020
Anthony Taylor: cause it kind of sums up it in the life. Of what Anthony does now understand. I am a senior principal.

7
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:52.200
Anthony Taylor: What does that mean? A senior principal in most companies is usually the highest technical non management person in the company.

8
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.739
Anthony Taylor: I get to make the call, make the decision

9
00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:05.030
Anthony Taylor: everything else about any technical thing that occurs in the data space for me. I'm in the data space.

10
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:19.189
Anthony Taylor: So like, we have application principle, we have an IT, you know, the one L systems principle. so my area is data space. If everything was perfect there would be a bunch of developers working, and I would be

11
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:27.949
Anthony Taylor: watching and basically relaxing on my laurels and collecting a paycheck. However. that is not the case.

12
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.420
Anthony Taylor: Reality hits when you actually get to work, and you realize that

13
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.720
Anthony Taylor: literally, nobody there knows how to do

14
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.600
Anthony Taylor: the more advanced stuff that you're bringing to the table.

15
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.830
Anthony Taylor: Everybody at the organization I'm at now are SQL. Developers.

16
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.629
Anthony Taylor: which is fine. SQL. Is a wonderful tool. I you can't do. It's the language of data.

17
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.740
Anthony Taylor:  but

18
00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:04.890
Anthony Taylor: they wanted to scale up and SQL. Server and most SQL. Databases just don't have the capability to scale up.  So

19
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.159
Anthony Taylor: they bring in. Someone like my expertise is in large scale data.

20
00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:17.250
Anthony Taylor: SQL, data, engineering and data science.  this morning

21
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.750
Anthony Taylor: I woke up bright and early, and had a

22
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:30.800
Anthony Taylor: team's message from somebody in Croatia, one of our sister offices that said, Hey, it looks like we've got some data that's wrong in this table.

23
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

24
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:43.120
Anthony Taylor: So first got identified the wrong data. They show me the wrong data. Then I start going back looking at the pipeline that we built

25
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.360
Anthony Taylor: to get that data from the source system into the target system which this end user is now looking at.

26
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.910
Anthony Taylor: While doing that.

27
00:02:52.060 --> 00:03:05.810
Anthony Taylor: I'm working with other individuals, and that that help build that pipeline on the other side. So there's the source side. Then there's my side. So the source side guy, I give him on the phone dude. Get on phone. Something's wrong.

28
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:14.359
Anthony Taylor: Our guy who does. He's he's responsible for our source data also gets on the phone because he's the one that checks the data.

29
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.980
Anthony Taylor: And he's like, Oh, yeah, that date's wrong. I'm like. thanks for that. And then, of course. the manager in charge.

30
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.100
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so this is my morning. I'm talking

31
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.820
Anthony Taylor: 7, 45 A. M. About when I logged in and I saw this my time.

32
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:45.179
Anthony Taylor:  So everyone's on. We're looking at the data. Yep, it's wrong. Why is it wrong? And I go through using python and SQL. Mostly, mostly, mostly python

33
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.550
Anthony Taylor: to look at the data that was sent over to me. In fact.

34
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.900
Anthony Taylor: it was basically.

35
00:03:53.270 --> 00:04:00.159
Anthony Taylor:  this sequel here or this code here. So you see, I have this check table function.

36
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:12.269
Anthony Taylor: So what this is going to do, and I'm not going to get too deep into it, because I don't think you guys care about all that. But this is a function. These tables are treated a little differently because they're restricted data.

37
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.040
Anthony Taylor:  I keep a list of tables with issues. I tell it.

38
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.689
Anthony Taylor: What schema to go to that's in database. Talk?

39
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.049
Anthony Taylor: I have a directory with all the metadata, so I can grab the keys of every table.

40
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.449
Anthony Taylor: I use those keys. I do some parsing. Get those keys out of the file.

41
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:39.010
Anthony Taylor: I use those keys to to query the table and look for problem data.

42
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.460
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so this is somebody to put together this morning.

43
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.789
Anthony Taylor:  I don't know. So this was done by probably 8, 15.

44
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.430
Anthony Taylor: And then, once that's done. We start running this process and we're looking. So

45
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.450
Anthony Taylor: I have like 80 tables, about 22 of them had an issue.

46
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.660
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But

47
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.989
Anthony Taylor: as we started tweaking this, we had to figure out what that issue was. So the issue was.

48
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.929
Anthony Taylor: rows were coming in that were updates.

49
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:25.459
Anthony Taylor: but the system indicated they were inserts. Now my code is smart enough to know if the data exists. Don't try to insert it.

50
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.639
Anthony Taylor: however, because it came as an insert. We didn't do anything with it.

51
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.139
Anthony Taylor: The data was already there. We said. Ignore it. It's wrong.

52
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.380
Anthony Taylor: Turns out that was we were right. It's wrong.

53
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:47.539
Anthony Taylor: But we needed to process it as an update. So our data was wrong because this created record was actually an update and we did not process it.

54
00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.689
Anthony Taylor: Curry. is there odd lighting on your head.

55
00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.069
Kevin Nguyen: Does that sound fun?

56
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.829
Curry Gardner: Yeah. I moved to a different room.

57
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.360
Curry Gardner: shining like directly at me.

58
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.160
Curry Gardner: That's why I kind of like angle myself into the

59
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.539
Anthony Taylor: I totally thought that was like a

60
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.679
Anthony Taylor: like like you like, dyed your hair. Okay, anyway.

61
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.080
Anthony Taylor:  okay. So that was my morning.

62
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.710
Anthony Taylor: Once you figured out the problem. We realized, are we we called

63
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:39.730
Anthony Taylor: the vendor that that does the tool that we use to get the data into azure? And then

64
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:53.059
Anthony Taylor: that vendor said, No, it's not us, it's the source. So we went back to the source. People said, What the hell they said we don't know. So then my job became, how am I going to clean this up in the entire environment?

65
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.129
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So the remainder of the day

66
00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.969
Anthony Taylor: I spent looking into each and every one of these tables

67
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.410
Anthony Taylor: programmatically, of course.

68
00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:15.800
Anthony Taylor: to figure out what was wrong. The good news is wasn't as bad as we originally thought. Bad news is, we found something new that is much worse.

69
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.270
Anthony Taylor:  basically.

70
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.320
Anthony Taylor: in this table that was called lips.

71
00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:29.189
Anthony Taylor: I'm I found a record of the 40 million records

72
00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:30.990
Anthony Taylor: that

73
00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.650
Anthony Taylor: this value in the source.

74
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.110
Anthony Taylor: it has data in it.

75
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:48.030
Anthony Taylor: but in in our trends, in in the records that I'm getting, we were never sent that date. So we have a big problem. Now.

76
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:56.419
Anthony Taylor: okay, now, we gotta find out why this is why we didn't. We never received this data for us to update our team.

77
00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.249
Anthony Taylor: Good news for me.

78
00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:02.899
Anthony Taylor: It's not my stuff. Bad news for me.

79
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:07.340
Anthony Taylor: I'm the one that's gonna have to figure it out with the other with the vendor and everything.

80
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:12.160
Anthony Taylor: So it's loads, loads, loads of fun.

81
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.229
Anthony Taylor: So, yeah, that was my whole day. Well, that

82
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.040
Anthony Taylor: helping like 3 or 4 different

83
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.599
Anthony Taylor: with their code stuff.

84
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:28.609
Anthony Taylor: So as a principle. you could actually look at this role is like, right right now, I work for as like a developer.

85
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:36.560
Anthony Taylor: but at a senior level. So I'm writing some pretty elaborate stuff. You wouldn't be writing stuff like this immediately.

86
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:41.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I'll show you guys and we'll do something terrible

87
00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:52.800
Anthony Taylor: terrible, I tell you. No, not really. But so, since I am the Admin and God of all things in this environment. I can look at other people's environments.

88
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.560
Anthony Taylor:  most of them

89
00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:03.280
Anthony Taylor: like one of the other data engineers. HIJ,

90
00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.430
Anthony Taylor: okay.

91
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:14.099
Anthony Taylor: where is it? There it is. They do most of their stuff in SQL,

92
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.110
Anthony Taylor: so

93
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:25.459
Anthony Taylor: like here. So if you look at theirs, their whole thing is, this is just

94
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.120
Anthony Taylor: they're not even doing python.

95
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:35.670
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So one of my jobs is actually to teach this person how to use I,

96
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.960
Anthony Taylor: which for the record. they're getting a whole lot better with it.

97
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.209
Anthony Taylor: can see they're starting to do python.

98
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.980
Anthony Taylor: which makes me super happy.

99
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:54.169
Anthony Taylor: But yeah. So my day was mostly spent building pipelines from the source to the target

100
00:09:54.390 --> 00:10:06.349
Anthony Taylor:  and and mentoring others. The other part that I do a lot of when I'm not doing all the coding is, I do a lot of poc.

101
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.250
Anthony Taylor: So, for instance.

102
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.539
Anthony Taylor: I think it's in

103
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:17.040
Anthony Taylor: teaching.

104
00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:26.309
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So like, here, you can see, I'm loading the code

105
00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:31.480
Anthony Taylor: model for Obama. I'm loading it into the system.

106
00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:37.029
Anthony Taylor: writing it all out, because I will be using this to teach others how to do this

107
00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.500
Anthony Taylor: and how to use it.

108
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.959
Anthony Taylor: Very exciting stuff. But look, there's stuff you guys. Look at Tokenizer.

109
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:50.730
Anthony Taylor: What

110
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:58.740
Anthony Taylor: I mean. I zoom with you some of this. But to be honest with you guys, look at this real quick. Okay.

111
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.839
Anthony Taylor: we have a function as prompts.

112
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:05.899
Anthony Taylor: Pipeline says, do I use a template? True or false?

113
00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:12.969
Anthony Taylor: It says, if batch size is not in the arguments, then set the batch size to one.

114
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:21.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if the Max new tokens is not in the arguments. Set the Max tokens at 5 12. Alright, then

115
00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:27.249
Anthony Taylor: we're going to create this dictionary object. Update these arguments

116
00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.240
with these tokens.

117
00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:40.510
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to simply say, pipeline and output degenerated text from the Llm. You guys are going to learn how to do this. By the way.

118
00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:42.760
Anthony Taylor: okay.

119
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:48.160
Anthony Taylor: and that's pretty much it just some examples of inputs.

120
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:54.789
Anthony Taylor: So I guess for me.

121
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.339
Anthony Taylor: that's pretty much an explanation of what I do.

122
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:03.930
Clayton Graves: In the morning. You do all that work on Jupiter

123
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:11.700
Anthony Taylor: in where? No? Well, if you notice these notebooks that I was showing you. They look like Jupiter, right?

124
00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:16.230
Anthony Taylor: Let's pick one of the ones I was showing

125
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.719
Anthony Taylor: like this one. Look at this notebook. Doesn't it look like Jupiter?

126
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.080
Anthony Taylor: It certainly does right

127
00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:36.539
Anthony Taylor: because it is basically a Jupiter notebook. These are way more capable. They have built in. II was showing you guys earlier. They have built in AI, we also have, you know, like you guys in Vs code, you got variables.

128
00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:43.400
Anthony Taylor: We got variables. Let see revision history. This is every change that has ever been made to this notebook.

129
00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:53.419
Anthony Taylor: and I can go and look at you know what this looked like earlier or whatever. and I can revert back to it, or I can just copy part of it.

130
00:12:53.450 --> 00:13:04.339
Anthony Taylor: whatever I need to do right? Well, it's in data bricks, which yes, I'm an azure. But data bricks works in aws and boom.

131
00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.180
Anthony Taylor: yeah, well, that's weird.

132
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:13.770
Anthony Taylor:  we can also comment another thing.

133
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:18.689
Anthony Taylor: if if I go into a notebook. I think I'm in. Let's go to a notebook I'm already in.

134
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:22.050
Anthony Taylor: I noticed earlier it was up there.

135
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:30.150
Anthony Taylor:  The other thing you can do if we're working together. And I do this all the time. When I'm helping people

136
00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:39.600
Anthony Taylor: is, they'll say, Hey, I need help with this code, and I'll go. What notebook are you in? And they'll just either send me the name or this link.

137
00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:48.589
Anthony Taylor: and then I'll come in, and you'll actually see an icon up here. The shows. I'm in the notebook, and they can see my cursor. They can see me type.

138
00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:55.679
Anthony Taylor: and we can work together at the same time, no matter where I am. I could help them right now, if someone

139
00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:03.510
Anthony Taylor: right, it's a collaboration function of data breaks. A lot of tools are doing stuff like this. Now,

140
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:14.870
Anthony Taylor: like, I said, I'm I'm highly considered a data bricks expert. A. But yeah. So anyway. any questions

141
00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:19.529
Anthony Taylor: I know that was a little off off off. Did you have question after? Go ahead?

142
00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.559
Gebrekristos, Haftom: Yes,

143
00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:28.169
Gebrekristos, Haftom: Are your function. Can I call your function from within azure Adf.

144
00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:34.459
Gebrekristos, Haftom: From data breaks Adf. Itself. No, no, you can call data bricks from Adf.

145
00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:43.050
Anthony Taylor: right? So II don't have Adf. I'm not connected to my azure account. But Adf has a data bridge connector.

146
00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:58.399
Anthony Taylor: And so if you have a token which you know you get in your user settings. You go to developer. And then you could create a token. So then you could connect Adf and you can run notebooks. You can get data. You can do all kinds of stuff.

147
00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:07.739
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's a good question. Alright question. I do. We do a lot with Adf because we have a lot of on-prem servers, and I heard that term before.

148
00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:13.129
Anthony Taylor: Good one to know on prem servers.

149
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.960
Clayton Graves: No, I've I've heard it.

150
00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:20.149
Anthony Taylor: Sonya said it on premise. All that means is is that they're not in the cloud.

151
00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:22.380
Clayton Graves: Now, data breaks

152
00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:31.250
Anthony Taylor: data. Bricks is in the cloud, so I can't because of firewalls and stuff like that. I can't access directly

153
00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:36.480
Anthony Taylor: on prem servers. So we use a tool called azure data factory.

154
00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:38.270
Anthony Taylor: And it

155
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:50.009
Anthony Taylor: we put a server on Prem, and we connect to it through a firewall, and it connects to those those databases. So through that pipeline, it gets up here in the cloud. Then I can take those.

156
00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:56.210
Clayton Graves: How much of your infrastructure and your your environment is on prem versus in the cloud.

157
00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:13.470
Anthony Taylor: What percentage they are. Flex really didn't embrace the cloud until a few years ago, right before they hired me because I my again, my specialty area is like big data analytics which most of the time you do that in cloud.

158
00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:17.129
Anthony Taylor: And I am. I'm certified. Aws solution architect

159
00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:24.450
Anthony Taylor: and many of my clients was your. So when they hired me, it was to become more mature in the cloud.

160
00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:33.349
Anthony Taylor: so they haven't been there a lot. So I would say, probably 50% right now is 50% on 50% cloud.

161
00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:42.309
Clayton Graves: And fortunately the nature of what we do and who we do it, for we can't really use cloud for much. Well, that makes sense for what you yeah, I agree.

162
00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:43.410
Anthony Taylor: I agree

163
00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:50.699
Anthony Taylor: alright. Any other questions any other like you were wondering what you what people do, what what I do.

164
00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:55.749
Anthony Taylor: This is basically it. I do a whole lot of meetings where I'm telling people how we're gonna do it.

165
00:16:56.190 --> 00:17:02.570
Anthony Taylor: hey? We were thinking, no, this is how we're gonna do stop thinking. This kid.

166
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.390
Anthony Taylor: I mean, sort of

167
00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:11.229
Anthony Taylor: it's really hard, because they have a lot of wonderful smart people that.

168
00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:16.139
Anthony Taylor: unlike you guys who have gone through and learned like a gazillion things

169
00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:25.160
Anthony Taylor: right? They got really good at one thing and everything they do. They try to bring it back to that one thing. Well, that one thing is awesome.

170
00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:34.469
Anthony Taylor: but it's let me just give you an example. A SQL. Server can only hold 4 TB a day.

171
00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:36.580
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

172
00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:44.329
Anthony Taylor: this is my database right here. All of these little things on the left

173
00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:52.249
Anthony Taylor: right. Now, today it is over a hundred terabytes. That's 25

174
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:53.759
Anthony Taylor: SQL. Servers.

175
00:17:55.110 --> 00:18:00.339
Anthony Taylor: Okay, single server couldn't do it. They would have never been able to do this ever, ever.

176
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.240
Anthony Taylor: Okay, they just couldn't do it without having like

177
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:07.840
Anthony Taylor: a whole, but they would probably have 60 different servers

178
00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:17.539
Anthony Taylor: to to be able to do what I'm doing in one environment. and and that's the difference, and that

179
00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:24.130
Anthony Taylor: is is us aboard Mike to death. He's literally sleeping. No, he woke up.

180
00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.080
Anthony Taylor: anyway. So any other questions

181
00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.959
michael mcpherson: I'm just chilling like a villain.

182
00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:36.470
Anthony Taylor: Okay. you guys ready to get to work on the hardest day of the year.

183
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:48.829
Clayton Graves: You gotta quit doing that, because now I'm all intimidated and that's not II okay, when I do it for a reason struggle. But now I gotta be intimidated and struggled.

184
00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:53.450
Anthony Taylor: But when you do good, when it turns out easy, you're like, Oh, that wasn't hard

185
00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.410
Anthony Taylor: except for today's gonna be fun. Okay. So

186
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:09.919
Anthony Taylor: I wish I could tell you it was gonna be easy. But as I went, the it's really how they did the activities right. The activities are just tough.

187
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:15.239
Anthony Taylor: the the content. I don't know if it's that tough the activities they're tough today.

188
00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:21.200
Anthony Taylor: Would you say it was tough in comparison to yesterday? Because yesterday

189
00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:26.529
Clayton Graves: I'm not gonna speak for the rest of my group. But I struggled and did not get through a single one.

190
00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:30.490
Anthony Taylor: Well, weren't you working in a group?

191
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:39.440
Mason, Natalie: We got through a single one. We've never finished a single activity. Well, we've that's not uncommon.

192
00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:41.670
Anthony Taylor: No, that's true. That's not

193
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:47.680
Anthony Taylor: all right. Well, the good news is, we're starting.

194
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:58.850
Anthony Taylor: We? We did all the company. Yeah, that's point of content. Wait, what's going on? Proof of concept is a poc. Thank you. Silo.

195
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:14.629
Anthony Taylor: Yes. Yes, poc, so basically. new technology, new things that are happening or big things they want to do. They ask me to figure out how to do it. And then I show everybody. And then we decided.

196
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.510
Anthony Taylor: okay. alright.

197
00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.730
Anthony Taylor: let's get to it. We're starting behind. That's okay. We'll catch up

198
00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.189
Anthony Taylor: on Monday if we have to

199
00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:34.280
Anthony Taylor: advance in. Lp, so today is actually, I thought we were, gonna get into some real Nlp modeling.

200
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.959
Anthony Taylor: We're still not really going to do that.

201
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:43.049
Anthony Taylor: But that's really cool ways to do analytics on text

202
00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:44.360
Anthony Taylor: coming today.

203
00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:52.050
Anthony Taylor: Good stuff. Alright. But first I was telling you guys about the

204
00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:56.469
Anthony Taylor: TFID. F. Yesterday when I jumped the gun.

205
00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:07.899
Anthony Taylor: Basically Tf stands for term frequency or the the well term frequency. So this is explaining why we care about tf, it's quite important in sentiment analysis.

206
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:13.339
Anthony Taylor: It helps us understand how important a word is in the document collection or corpus.

207
00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:16.750
Anthony Taylor: So tf is term frequency.

208
00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:21.520
Anthony Taylor: When you guys are doing the calendar. Yesterday, you were basically doing term frequency.

209
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:36.010
Anthony Taylor: Okay, inverse document, frequency is slightly different. So this is a waiting, this combining these 2 and it just it's trying to figure out if a word is important or not.

210
00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:40.800
Anthony Taylor: So term frequency kind of a word did that with the counter method yesterday.

211
00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:43.540
Anthony Taylor: Idf is another method.

212
00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:46.609
Anthony Taylor: This is the function for it.

213
00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:52.229
Anthony Taylor: the more documents that include the term, the lower the Idf score.

214
00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:57.690
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So this kind of goes back to what I said. If you were reading a paper on

215
00:21:57.850 --> 00:21:58.850
Anthony Taylor: fish.

216
00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:05.239
Anthony Taylor: and the the word fish loses its importance because the paper is about fish

217
00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:16.400
Anthony Taylor: make sense. It's still. I mean, we understand it's about fish. It's like, well, we know it's about fish. But if we wanted to come up with, what about fish?

218
00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:22.960
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we would need to stop considering or stop giving it a lot of weight to give other things weight.

219
00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:30.969
Anthony Taylor: So tf, idf is the product of the 2. Tf, so how often the word is there brings it up. Idf brings it back down.

220
00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.050
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

221
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:37.480
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna see this work. The rationale indicates how frequently word appears.

222
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:44.729
Anthony Taylor: If that word appears in multiple times, it's likely to be more relevant, meaningful than other words. Text. That's term frequency.

223
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:47.700
Clayton Graves: So so your your

224
00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:51.829
Clayton Graves: your your example of a document about fish.

225
00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:54.620
Clayton Graves: Okay, use the weight of the word fish.

226
00:22:54.820 --> 00:23:02.870
Clayton Graves: but would it would increase the weight of what like words like fin or wait. Or maybe

227
00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:08.559
Anthony Taylor: so, let's say you have a paragraph that talks about the anatomy of a fifth.

228
00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:20.340
Anthony Taylor: Right? So maybe Scales is going to have a lot of weight instead of the word fish. Right? It's the anatomy of a fish. So we care about. We don't fish shouldn't carry a lot of weight in that paragraph.

229
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:23.010
Anthony Taylor: because the whole document is about fish.

230
00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:26.140
Anthony Taylor: So in that case, your term frequency.

231
00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:31.609
Anthony Taylor: you know, it could be scale or internal organs or organs. Maybe.

232
00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:33.300
Anthony Taylor: So

233
00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:39.479
Anthony Taylor: yeah, here's the crazy part guys, we're gonna go through this. And I'm gonna talk about this.

234
00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:47.890
Anthony Taylor: And it doesn't carry a lot of weight in the final model. But it is part of the preprocessing that we normally do. Okay.

235
00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:59.830
Anthony Taylor: alright. So the rationale ideal when you're analyzing multiple documents. If a word also appears many times among the collection documents, it may be a frequent word and not a relevant one.

236
00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:05.979
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's the idf, part of tf idea.

237
00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:12.170
Anthony Taylor: This is a cool scale. So terms with a low tf, low term frequency.

238
00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:19.720
Anthony Taylor: but high document frequency. This reflects that a term is commonly used, and that it could be less meaningful.

239
00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:27.680
Anthony Taylor: Okay, terms with a high terminal frequency term frequency. But low document frequency.

240
00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:36.400
Anthony Taylor: This reflects term is more meaningful, more valuable to an analysis. Now tell me if I'm wrong, guys, didn't these to be switched

241
00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:40.250
Anthony Taylor: when you think this one would be on the higher scale.

242
00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.650
Anthony Taylor: Oh, wait! Maybe they're saying it.

243
00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:49.340
Clayton Graves: It has carries more weight. If it's if it's more, if it if it's more meaningful than it carries more weight.

244
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.450
Anthony Taylor: Alright. I like it. I got it. Now, I understand.

245
00:24:54.100 --> 00:25:07.600
Anthony Taylor: So term frequency, we basically refer to this as the bag of words interesting. They didn't mentioned yesterday.  basically a bag of words. It's the words without any context.

246
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:15.140
Anthony Taylor: We don't care what they're next to. We don't care about nothing. It's a word. How many times did it show up?

247
00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:20.189
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's why we call it. It's just a bag of words.

248
00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:29.849
Anthony Taylor: We don't care about anything where they are what they do, anything. We just want to know how many there are. Okay. And this is where.

249
00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:41.779
Anthony Taylor: normally, in the old days we used to show the bag of words before we showed stop words. Okay, because, as you can see here, look at these like the most common words in this example.

250
00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:44.050
Anthony Taylor: it IV, 2 and

251
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:46.540
Anthony Taylor: all stopwords.

252
00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:51.159
Clayton Graves: Yeah, I was just gonna say, those look like, stop words, some of those

253
00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:56.299
Anthony Taylor: yeah, they they they kind of took this out of order. But that's okay. It's still the same concept.

254
00:25:56.350 --> 00:26:03.329
Anthony Taylor: It's a bag of words. Just think of it when we do the bag of words now, because we already did our stop words. You'll you'll

255
00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.440
Anthony Taylor: those words won't show up. Okay.

256
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:08.330
Anthony Taylor: alright. So

257
00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.229
Anthony Taylor: let's go see this in action.

258
00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.950
Anthony Taylor: I hope we got. I hope, I hope.

259
00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:22.980
Anthony Taylor: Rodney, that was A bit of an example of a day in the life.

260
00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:25.899
Anthony Taylor: I had to keep it kind of short.

261
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:30.150
Masarirambi, Rodney: No, no, it it it, it makes sense. I mean it. It

262
00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:36.019
Masarirambi, Rodney: gives gives an idea. It's just like. sometimes we must learn a different concept. And you see that you like.

263
00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:42.339
Masarirambi, Rodney: okay, when are we gonna use this? And when we're gonna use this and how we're gonna use it. And then it's

264
00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:46.170
Anthony Taylor: you know, it's so maybe Kevin James, if he went for us.

265
00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:49.590
Anthony Taylor: maybe Kevin James can throw together a 15 min. One.

266
00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:58.399
Anthony Taylor: Is there more like in that earlier levels tonight? So it. It opens up a lot of questions, and we could easily take up an entire night on the subject.

267
00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:05.390
Anthony Taylor: Well, there's always office hours come early tomorrow or Monday talk. Okay. here we are

268
00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.510
Anthony Taylor: back in Jupiter.

269
00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:14.860
Anthony Taylor: NTLK. So we got the national language toolkit. We're gonna bring in voiters again.

270
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:21.690
Anthony Taylor: and then we have count vectorizer. And TSID

271
00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:23.030
Anthony Taylor: vectorizer.

272
00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:26.949
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's what's happening.

273
00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.210
Okay.

274
00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.230
Anthony Taylor: so let's bring these guys in.

275
00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:39.950
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna print the categories doesn't add enough times.

276
00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:43.090
Anthony Taylor: We're going to get the file. Ids.

277
00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:45.420
Anthony Taylor: See how many we have.

278
00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:52.429
Anthony Taylor: 10,788. Alright. So with that, we're gonna grab

279
00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:59.850
Anthony Taylor: this one. okay and print it out. Japan to revise long-term energy demand down.

280
00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:10.699
Anthony Taylor: we're going to create an instance of the count vectorizer. And we're going to apply the stop words as well. Actually.

281
00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:23.659
Anthony Taylor: no, this is just on the stop. Okay, in this first one. Then. oh, never mind. let me back up. We're going to initialize the count vectorizer

282
00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.060
Anthony Taylor: with the stop works.

283
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:28.290
Anthony Taylor: And we're going to call it vectorize.

284
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:34.230
Anthony Taylor: then to our X variable. We're gonna say, Hey, use this vectorizer

285
00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:38.100
Anthony Taylor: and fit transform the Doc text

286
00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.899
Anthony Taylor: that we captured here.

287
00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:41.890
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

288
00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.690
Anthony Taylor: And you'll see that.

289
00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:48.400
Anthony Taylor: And then we can take a look and see what it looks like. So

290
00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:51.879
Anthony Taylor: W, while this looks a little bit confusing.

291
00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:55.199
Anthony Taylor: Okay, basically, the

292
00:28:55.240 --> 00:29:08.120
Anthony Taylor: the first number is the document number. Well, we only did one document. So it's going to be 0. The second number is the index of word in the text.

293
00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:10.770
Anthony Taylor: Got it?

294
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:24.809
Anthony Taylor:  so, and then the last number is how many times, it appears, don't worry. It's gonna get better. I gotta. I gotta. I got a question here. So going back up and and

295
00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:31.389
Clayton Graves: cell 4 says, select and print a single document of text. We chose document 2,

296
00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.940
Clayton Graves: which is the third

297
00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:36.020
Clayton Graves: document. So that document, yes, there's a Doc text

298
00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.180
Clayton Graves: variable is.

299
00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:46.509
Clayton Graves: And when you come down here and you do the vectorizer and fit transform the Doc text. then you talk about what article?

300
00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:53.420
Anthony Taylor: How did you mute yourself in the middle of that conversation.

301
00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:55.880
Clayton Graves: Pure talent.

302
00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.909
Clayton Graves: So the the question is.

303
00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:06.840
Clayton Graves: shouldn't we? We're doing the the vectorizer. We're printing X, which is fit transform dot text

304
00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:13.660
Clayton Graves: which that variable references? Document 2. Article 2.

305
00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:20.820
Anthony Taylor: Why does it all say 0? Shouldn't it all say 2. Because we only pass one document

306
00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:28.900
Anthony Taylor: into our vectorizer. So it has no idea the 2 only references which one it is in this corpus.

307
00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:34.440
Anthony Taylor: So okay, we only passed one in. So now it's back to 0. It's the only one that's there.

308
00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:49.040
Anthony Taylor: But if we passed multiple documents, then it would come up 1, 2, 3, and we will. We'll get to that. But yes, in this one we only pass one, and this is the index of where it is now. The cool thing is, you don't have to go count this out and figure it out.

309
00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.340
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

310
00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:59.120
Anthony Taylor: we can get all using. Get feature names out. Remember, we use that before. Oh, yes, I'm

311
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:04.430
Baro, Sonja: and real quick. The vectorizer dot fit transform

312
00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:17.929
Baro, Sonja: is the fit transform. Did you go over? Why we're doing that. Is it because we're taking and changing text to numbers is that basically, yeah, vectorizer itself

313
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:23.209
Anthony Taylor: is is going to create vectors from our data.

314
00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:27.150
Baro, Sonja: okay, from every word that's in there. And then it's going to count them.

315
00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:31.670
Anthony Taylor: Well, it's not gonna count them. This. Yeah, it does count factor.

316
00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:37.060
Baro, Sonja: So the transform. That's the method. Right? That's being used.

317
00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:44.350
Anthony Taylor: The it's just like every other model that we've trained. It's like, it's like standard scaling.

318
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:52.859
Baro, Sonja: right? We always had to do a fit transform.

319
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:54.360
Anthony Taylor: No good question.

320
00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:56.480
Anthony Taylor: And and remember.

321
00:31:56.770 --> 00:32:03.979
Anthony Taylor: and we're applying it to this data later. If you were to bring something in like use the State in a model, you'd have to apply this again.

322
00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:14.340
Clayton Graves: Okay, with the same stop words. Otherwise it wouldn't work. This is listing the count for each word in the article right

323
00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:24.119
Clayton Graves: output, so that we could see what word is being represented instead of just adding, in America.

324
00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.000
Anthony Taylor: watch this.

325
00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:35.620
Anthony Taylor: So here I'm gonna say, Hey, give me the feature names of this. Remember, we've done this with other other models as well. So these are all the words.

326
00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:40.280
Anthony Taylor: okay, still not very easy to put this and this together is

327
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:45.530
Anthony Taylor: so let's go. One more. I agree.

328
00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:50.719
Anthony Taylor: So here we've got the link. So how many words? And then we're going to look at.

329
00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:56.210
Anthony Taylor: We're 25. Which is this one?

330
00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:01.229
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we're just gonna say, Hey, give me word 25.

331
00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:06.789
Anthony Taylor: And look at that. So there's 81 total words, words, 25 is energy.

332
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:14.130
Anthony Taylor: So what did we learn? Cal vectorizer showed us? Energy is in there 8 times.

333
00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:24.979
Anthony Taylor: and what we could see. That's the most. This just gave us a list of all the words. This we actually look to see which word 25 is. But we're not done yet.

334
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:34.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so now we can say, print the number of times each word appears from the document. So here all we're gonna do is create an array

335
00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:37.200
Anthony Taylor: from this up here.

336
00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:40.809
Clayton Graves: I know I'm gonna be this late, and I'm so sorry, but

337
00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:50.220
Clayton Graves: print words 25. The output is 81 energy.

338
00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:53.330
Clayton Graves: Now the word for enter length of words.

339
00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:56.130
Clayton Graves: the lace 81

340
00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:58.549
Clayton Graves: is that the link?

341
00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:07.019
Anthony Taylor: It's the length of this list. See here, we did vectorize, get feature names out to the words variable.

342
00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:08.860
Anthony Taylor: So that's this list.

343
00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:14.470
Anthony Taylor: Alright length of words is the how many words are in here.

344
00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:19.689
Anthony Taylor: Words? 25. Ever I said. Up here. This is the document.

345
00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:26.460
Anthony Taylor: the index. and the count. So link 25 is showing us this work.

346
00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.800
Clayton Graves: Okay, so let me sum this up.

347
00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:31.179
Clayton Graves: Document 0

348
00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:34.120
Clayton Graves: word 25 appears 8 times.

349
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:40.209
Clayton Graves: Then we scroll absolutely. And we asked, we asked it, what word 25 is.

350
00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:44.239
Clayton Graves: and we want the length of the entire list

351
00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:50.030
Clayton Graves: from start to that was just for giggles. I mean? I just say, Hey, look! There's 81 words in there.

352
00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:57.250
Clayton Graves: But the money shot here is that word 25 is energy, and it appears

353
00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:59.540
Anthony Taylor: 100% correct.

354
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:03.190
Anthony Taylor: Got it. Alright, Cindy.

355
00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:13.769
Sihong Zhou: yes, I just have one question. Ca, can we organize the victor this model by ascending or descending order?

356
00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:21.929
Anthony Taylor: Yes, we can. You guys, I love that you guys are so into this today. But give me a second.

357
00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:35.470
Clayton Graves: We're gonna get there. I promise. The words on the list is that order, random, or is it?

358
00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:38.479
Clayton Graves: It's based on this right here.

359
00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:50.110
Clayton Graves: So when it when it appears well, probably here we go. Here we go. Let's let's look at this. So let's look at index word 2.

360
00:35:52.130 --> 00:36:05.570
Anthony Taylor: And the word is 23, which that makes sense. So no, it's just it looks like this is alphabetical. Yeah, yeah, it does know other than being alphabetical. It doesn't.

361
00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:10.009
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Okay, was Taft. Do you have a question?

362
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:13.749
Gebrekristos, Haftom: Yeah, go back to the X output.

363
00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:17.220
Gebrekristos, Haftom: Okay, so 0 38.

364
00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:28.519
Gebrekristos, Haftom: What if a word appears multiple times like in a different index? So 38 is the first index, or what is it? That's a great question

365
00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:33.120
Anthony Taylor: that Index refers to this list.

366
00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:43.410
Anthony Taylor: It's not the index in the text itself. It's the index in this list that it created while it was doing.

367
00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:44.660
Anthony Taylor: okay.

368
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:52.279
Anthony Taylor: alright. So let's go back to 5. Okay, so keep it going. So here, we're just gonna take that X data

369
00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:58.079
Anthony Taylor: which we we, you know, is right here. Okay, we're gonna shift it into an array

370
00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:06.980
Anthony Taylor: so as you can see. Look 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 one line. There's 8. There's 8. Okay. I would bet you that's the 20, fifth, one

371
00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:09.850
Anthony Taylor: or 24, whatever I see.

372
00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:17.699
Anthony Taylor: Then here it is. We're gonna say, okay. So we have an array of all of our words.

373
00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.450
Anthony Taylor: We have an array of all of our counts.

374
00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:24.069
Anthony Taylor: That means we can create a data frame.

375
00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:29.470
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna say, data frame X to array and get feature names out.

376
00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:41.650
Anthony Taylor: And then we're just gonna look at some of the data. And we can see we have all the words with their counts underneath them.

377
00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:50.960
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Then, if we wanted to. This is like a reverse pivot melt, I do believe we've gone over. Melt before right?

378
00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:56.069
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Good. Derek's nodding signs. Okay? Good. So, Mel, we're just gonna say, Hey.

379
00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:07.670
Anthony Taylor: barname is word value. Name is word counts. and it's just gonna move it. So it shifted. So it looks like this. Okay. now that we have this here you go, Cindy.

380
00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:17.160
Anthony Taylor: we can sort it boom. And now you can see the highest ones and going down to the lowest.

381
00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:18.349
Clayton Graves: Okay? So

382
00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:28.679
Clayton Graves: so I did verify that that original list was alphabetical index starting at 0 from 25 energy. So that makes sense.

383
00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:43.159
Clayton Graves: And then here you've melt, basically just stacks it instead of having it all the way vertical like that, right? Instead of one row. We now have a row for every pair, and then we've sorted it.

384
00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:47.499
Clayton Graves:  it looks like we reset the index

385
00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:50.190
Clayton Graves:  and

386
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:53.480
Clayton Graves: now we're just doing it by word counts. Okay, I follow up.

387
00:38:54.290 --> 00:39:04.259
Anthony Taylor: See, there's a lot of effort to get to this. But these are cool little thing. There's a couple of things we're gonna do today. Guys like I said, this is like, analog stuff.

388
00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:09.690
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you will use tf-idf, but it's really a lot easier than all of what we're doing.

389
00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:18.359
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's like one line. But all of this is also for analysis. So that you guys can do analysis on

390
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.540
Anthony Taylor: the text.

391
00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:25.170
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so here, though, this is an alternative way to do what we just did

392
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:29.130
Anthony Taylor: using Ravel, I'm sure we talked about Ravel once as well.

393
00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:36.530
Anthony Taylor:  basically, it's gonna create an array with the names. It's gonna create an array with the counts.

394
00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:38.669
Anthony Taylor: And then it's gonna

395
00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:47.810
Anthony Taylor: you know. Then we're going to sort it and show it. And it's exactly the same. Just a different way to do it. Feel free to take it apart if you want. Okay, alright.

396
00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:52.239
Anthony Taylor: So now that we have the counts, we can start focusing on our

397
00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:55.969
Anthony Taylor: our idf score. So for this one.

398
00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:59.339
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna get the first. Here you go

399
00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:03.330
Anthony Taylor: 1,000 articles

400
00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.150
Anthony Taylor: out of waiters.

401
00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.840
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to

402
00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:14.790
Anthony Taylor: for each one. We're gonna put it into this raw. We're gonna look at number 50.

403
00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:25.500
Anthony Taylor: Tis to say, Hey, we looked at something. Nickel price is unlikely to rise much. Okay. Now, we're gonna do a different vector, one up above, just did count.

404
00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:35.919
Anthony Taylor: This one is the actual tf, id vector. vectorizer. So this is, gonna do it again. We're gonna fit transform.

405
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.380
Anthony Taylor: And then we can print it out. Now.

406
00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:45.870
Anthony Taylor: notice, this time. It's not all 0.

407
00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:58.359
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we have the counts of the words in our first document, and you can see down here at the bottom. We got last document. Okay, so this gives us our

408
00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:03.550
Anthony Taylor: our tf-idf, I believe that's the way itself. Let me make sure.

409
00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:08.270
Clayton Graves: Yeah, I was. Gonna say that that's floating. That's not the that's not the count.

410
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:19.879
Anthony Taylor: No, no, this isn't the count, because this is the tf, id. so I'm pretty. Each term is tuple, followed by a number for each line where C is the importance

411
00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:26.339
Anthony Taylor: of the term. So, yes, this will be the tf-id. So this is basically, id, tf.

412
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:30.350
Anthony Taylor: okay, that we were just talking about. This is that vowel

413
00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:31.870
Clayton Graves: is this 0 to one?

414
00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:36.690
Yeah. But it's almost never gonna get to what?

415
00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:49.249
Anthony Taylor: And you'll see, but it's reasonable to infer that if it's closer to one, then it's got a higher weight, right? Yes, that is through more weight, more the bigger the number no more the way.

416
00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:55.930
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. So here we could see the shape. There were 9,489 words.

417
00:41:56.430 --> 00:42:00.409
Anthony Taylor: 1,000 rows. We know that to be true or 1,000 documents.

418
00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:07.989
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So here we can get feature names. So this is going to give us all 9,489 words.

419
00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:15.019
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we're gonna use the second method because this is a big one.

420
00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:22.689
Anthony Taylor: You'd have 9,489 columns if you tried to do the first method. So we're going to do df data frame list.

421
00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:23.830
Anthony Taylor: Zip

422
00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:28.150
Anthony Taylor: words. Corpus. Okay, that's the the names

423
00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:38.710
Anthony Taylor: Ravel. the corpus. We're going to get the mean. and then this will return the word tf, idef. gonna sort it and output it

424
00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:43.670
Anthony Taylor: all in one thing. Okay, so here you can see

425
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:46.950
Anthony Taylor: versus appears to have the highest

426
00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:49.510
Anthony Taylor: tf, idea.

427
00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:53.439
Anthony Taylor: Alright, what does that mean to you guys?

428
00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:55.530
Anthony Taylor: Here's the lowest.

429
00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:00.920
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now.

430
00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:04.219
Anthony Taylor: at this point. And like, I said, this has.

431
00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:11.829
Anthony Taylor: This is a lot of effort to get something that gives us a very marginal improvement.

432
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:15.900
Anthony Taylor: Okay, where this is really important

433
00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:22.239
Anthony Taylor: is in some situations, you know, there will be words like.

434
00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:24.729
Anthony Taylor: like, you know, like

435
00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:30.130
Anthony Taylor: words kind of like. I don't know life.

436
00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:32.470
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

437
00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:37.749
Anthony Taylor: get it. Did I? Did I make that point clear enough. Anybody who writes like that

438
00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:43.380
Mason, Natalie: probably shouldn't be in journalism or

439
00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:50.850
Anthony Taylor: so. The the point is is that is, the idea of tf-idf is to get rid of

440
00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:59.320
Anthony Taylor: unnecessary repetition and identify necessary repetition. But

441
00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:02.830
Anthony Taylor: in in my practice

442
00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:11.469
Anthony Taylor: I've seen, I mean, yeah, it's something we do. But in the end, as you guys are, gonna find out, it's like 2 months. Okay, this is just doing the analysis

443
00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:19.610
Anthony Taylor: alright. And again, this is another great little thing to hold on to. because this really sets it up for you. Very well.

444
00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:23.180
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. And that's pretty much

445
00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:24.300
Anthony Taylor: that.

446
00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:31.230
Anthony Taylor: Conclude I could represent 10. Okay.

447
00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:35.770
Anthony Taylor: cool. Now.

448
00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:44.170
Anthony Taylor: there's just no freaking way.

449
00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.210
Clayton Graves: They're all solved.

450
00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:52.999
Anthony Taylor: They're not, though. look like nothing.

451
00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:57.380
Anthony Taylor: Nothing is is done. It's just the answer

452
00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:02.329
Anthony Taylor: right? There's like literally nothing given you guys, you guys wanna make this in everyone do?

453
00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:07.010
Clayton Graves: No, I think that's a good idea.

454
00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:08.470
michael mcpherson: Sure.

455
00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:21.610
Baro, Sonja: yeah, I would. That's great. II did want to just summarize the process. That so it sounded like, so

456
00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:28.260
Baro, Sonja: the first portion was just a lot of I'll call it pre-processing right, for

457
00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:35.460
Anthony Taylor: well, we just did the counts in the first port, and and we didn't need to. We just did it to show. This is how you can get the counts.

458
00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:37.979
Baro, Sonja: Okay? And then the whole

459
00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:41.129
Baro, Sonja: point, though, is like, you have to take

460
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:50.240
Baro, Sonja: the A text and turn it into a number. Did you have to vectorize it? Yeah. But that's not prepping it.

461
00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:58.119
Anthony Taylor: To be clear, this vector is only for the count and for the Tf, idf, we're not going to use this vectorization in the final model.

462
00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:01.190
Baro, Sonja: Okay? So yeah.

463
00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:06.960
Baro, Sonja: I'm just trying to process. Like, if I were asked to do this, it would be we take.

464
00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:17.969
Baro, Sonja: I have. I have an article, and I want to figure out what are the most important words in it, right? Or the a corpus

465
00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:19.770
Baro, Sonja: within that corpus.

466
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.559
Baro, Sonja: So I have to

467
00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:30.049
Baro, Sonja: pull out the wards themselves. then turn them into an array

468
00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:32.330
Baro, Sonja: right?

469
00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:36.370
Baro, Sonja: And then we run the

470
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:38.539
Baro, Sonja: TFID. F.

471
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:42.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay, yes.

472
00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:49.599
Baro, Sonja: I mean, if you want to do analysis on it? Yes, if you want to do.

473
00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:56.469
Baro, Sonja: I was trying to simplify in my brain how what we were doing. Sorry.

474
00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:00.899
Anthony Taylor: No, no, I'm glad you did that. I'm glad, I'm sure that helps somebody else as well.

475
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:02.910
Anthony Taylor: That is fantastic.

476
00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:04.960
Baro, Sonja: Okay.

477
00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:11.080
Anthony Taylor: Now, I was trying to find. and I'm sure we'll get to it.

478
00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:15.929
Clayton Graves: I'm I'm looking exercise correctly. They're all solved.

479
00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:19.469
Anthony Taylor: What do you mean? They're all selled

480
00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:23.660
Anthony Taylor: the one that the one that I was just showing you nothing solid.

481
00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:27.550
Clayton Graves: Yeah, that's me. I'm stupid. I was looking at yesterday.

482
00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:38.640
Anthony Taylor: You're so silly. Okay. alright, there's a lot lot to type. So let's get started. Okay,

483
00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:44.919
Anthony Taylor: And I'm probably gonna paste a lot of this to you guys.

484
00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:51.239
Anthony Taylor: So we've done the categories before.

485
00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:55.780
Anthony Taylor: So here it wants us to get session.

486
00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:02.180
Anthony Taylor: Alright, it wants us to get all of the money fx category. So we're gonna do categories

487
00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:09.260
Anthony Taylor: equals. And this is stuff that we've done for a couple of times. Now. money fx.

488
00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:16.879
Anthony Taylor: I I'm gonna tell you guys why I get like I'm kind of like, about this like this is not something you're ever gonna have to do.

489
00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:20.159
Anthony Taylor: This is only unique to this educational

490
00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:21.610
Anthony Taylor: process.

491
00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:27.749
Anthony Taylor:  and it's making you type. This just seems pointless

492
00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:29.929
Anthony Taylor: cause you're never gonna do this

493
00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:32.810
Anthony Taylor: except for in class

494
00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:40.589
Anthony Taylor: alright. So I don't know how much is I'm gonna make you type. Yeah, I'm not gonna make you type that

495
00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:44.279
Anthony Taylor:  I'm gonna give you this wholesale.

496
00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:56.019
Anthony Taylor: And I don't have a problem that they had to do that like I said, this is one of those things where it's. It's like busy work

497
00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:00.030
Anthony Taylor: doesn't make a lot of sense to make you type

498
00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:05.280
Anthony Taylor: all of this stuff that only applies to this one lesson.

499
00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:13.139
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so what do we get? So we got all the news articles about money. There's 893 of them.

500
00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:17.269
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so here, this one's not a whole lot. So we type it

501
00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:19.620
Anthony Taylor: money news.

502
00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:26.890
Anthony Taylor: equals. And we'll do a list. Comprehension. We're going to do 4 dots in

503
00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:34.409
Anthony Taylor: money news ids. And what do we want to do? Well, we basically just want to grab them. Grab the data from them.

504
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:37.289
Ru Reuters.

505
00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:39.130
Anthony Taylor: dot raw.

506
00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:41.050
Doc.

507
00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:48.070
Anthony Taylor: okay. And then that will give us

508
00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:52.070
what we want. So let's just print the length

509
00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:58.059
Anthony Taylor: of money news. Id, so we can see how many articles there are.

510
00:49:58.270 --> 00:50:01.769
Anthony Taylor: I don't know what I was typing. There, that's an interesting thing.

511
00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:05.480
Anthony Taylor: I was hoping it would fix it for me. But no

512
00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:08.560
Anthony Taylor: quick face now.

513
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:12.539
Anthony Taylor: alright, that took longer than just re-type. Okay.

514
00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:17.500
Anthony Taylor: so we have 883. So we're doing good. Everybody with me so far.

515
00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:21.490
Clayton Graves: Yeah, I'm a slow taper.

516
00:50:22.070 --> 00:50:24.710
Anthony Taylor: Oh, that's I don't get the point. Why.

517
00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:28.900
Anthony Taylor: okay? So in this one again, this is a small amount. So

518
00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:33.689
Anthony Taylor: vectorizer. So we're gonna initialize our vectorizer.

519
00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:43.360
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And by doing that we're going to use TFID vectorizer. we're gonna pass in our stop words.

520
00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:47.820
The ones for English cause. That's what we're working with right now.

521
00:50:48.710 --> 00:51:00.589
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then we're going to to our X variable. We're going to do fit transform our money news from up above. We're gonna do vectorizer

522
00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:02.180
Anthony Taylor: dot

523
00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:04.380
Anthony Taylor: fit transform

524
00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:06.470
Anthony Taylor: parentheses

525
00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:08.500
money news.

526
00:51:08.530 --> 00:51:10.559
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna transform

527
00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:15.360
Anthony Taylor: these items. How's that feeling to everybody? Everybody with me?

528
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:19.410
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we'll run that that's done.

529
00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:25.829
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna create a words list here. So we're gonna do words

530
00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:29.150
Anthony Taylor: equals. And this one's going to be list

531
00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:33.320
Anthony Taylor: parentheses. And we're gonna get our feature names.

532
00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:36.139
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so Vectorizer, dot.

533
00:51:36.450 --> 00:51:42.870
Anthony Taylor: get feature names out. open close. Okay, that's going to create a words list.

534
00:51:43.170 --> 00:51:45.019
Anthony Taylor: Now, we're going to get

535
00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:50.230
Anthony Taylor: our counts. So this is that cool rabble thing from before

536
00:51:52.080 --> 00:52:01.560
Anthony Taylor: frequency equals this. And then we're going to do in P. Ravel. Okay.

537
00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:09.650
Anthony Taylor: and pass in X dot sum, because we're gonna sum up all those values

538
00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:12.669
Anthony Taylor: and on the axis equal to

539
00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:15.790
Anthony Taylor: 0. Alright.

540
00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:23.249
Anthony Taylor: now, just a quick note. If anybody's looking at this and they're going. I have no idea what that.

541
00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:30.759
Anthony Taylor: And it's okay. But I'm going to do what I keep telling you guys to do. You'll have to do it right. Now

542
00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:34.810
Anthony Taylor: go into flipping co-pilot and say.

543
00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:42.550
Anthony Taylor: create a new chat and say,

544
00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:45.839
Anthony Taylor: what does this mean

545
00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:50.259
Anthony Taylor: in co-pilot or in python?

546
00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:52.790
Anthony Taylor: Aye.

547
00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:55.750
Anthony Taylor: and let it tell you.

548
00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:00.709
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And if it doesn't explain it in a way you like it.

549
00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:17.279
Anthony Taylor: that's telling you what it's doing. Yeah, it it knows what dumb it down for me, cause I've yeah or or say, my favorite, explain this

550
00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:20.180
Anthony Taylor: like

551
00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:25.059
Anthony Taylor: I am, you know, whatever age you feel like, say, 10 years old.

552
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:27.060
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

553
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.630
Anthony Taylor: And imagine you have a big box of colored blocks. Hey? I'm good with that.

554
00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:36.449
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I'm okay with that.

555
00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:43.299
Anthony Taylor: And this I'm telling you guys don't be shot. Don't I mean learning

556
00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:46.810
Anthony Taylor: this using this tool is smart.

557
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:49.280
Clayton Graves: Chachi. Pt, just okay.

558
00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:57.609
Anthony Taylor: it it really really is. I was just you might have saw when I first brought that up. I was just talking to a school teacher.

559
00:53:57.970 --> 00:54:01.280
Anthony Taylor: and I was telling them, I'm like, Hey. like.

560
00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:04.099
Anthony Taylor: use it as your assistant. What do you think it?

561
00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:12.929
Anthony Taylor: Why are you not using it? If nothing else? It does so much text for you. you know, so that you don't have to type it all yourself.

562
00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.679
Anthony Taylor: So anyway,

563
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:21.279
Anthony Taylor: highly recommend you do that don't necessarily do it while I'm talking.

564
00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:24.569
Anthony Taylor: But maybe shortly after that.

565
00:54:25.210 --> 00:54:26.170
Anthony Taylor: okay.

566
00:54:26.310 --> 00:54:32.339
Anthony Taylor: so now, we're gonna create a data frame from those 2 lists we just created.

567
00:54:32.350 --> 00:54:40.419
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to do Pd, dot data frame and parentheses. And in these we're going to have a column called Word.

568
00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:48.679
Anthony Taylor: and that's going to contain our words list. And then we're gonna add a column called Frequency.

569
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:56.170
Anthony Taylor: And that's gonna contain our frequency.

570
00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:04.779
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then we can just show our cool, new, nifty data frame that we just made.

571
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:15.370
Anthony Taylor: except I did something

572
00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:18.670
Anthony Taylor: word, close words.

573
00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:20.449
Anthony Taylor: It's something obvious, isn't.

574
00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:22.880
Anthony Taylor: Oh, this has to be a dictionary.

575
00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:26.830
Anthony Taylor: Remember that dictionary of lists.

576
00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:32.249
Anthony Taylor: I feel like if Matt is here, he would only that immediately.

577
00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:41.179
Raugewitz, Tania: Okay, even I was gonna say that. So I was adding my mute button. So I could like.

578
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:43.949
Anthony Taylor: just just remember, about

579
00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:48.440
Anthony Taylor: 50% of the mistakes I made, I make on purpose.

580
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:53.840
Anthony Taylor: So you guys can find it. But then, you know, it's always the same people. It starts to be no fun.

581
00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:59.969
Anthony Taylor: Okay, what else we got. Oh, and then we can sort this.

582
00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:07.789
Anthony Taylor: So we can say, money news, yeah, equals money news, yeah, store

583
00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:13.420
Anthony Taylor: values. And we're just gonna say, bye

584
00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:14.770
Anthony Taylor: equals.

585
00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:17.450
Anthony Taylor: Boom, boom, frequency.

586
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.939
Anthony Taylor: and then ascending is false.

587
00:56:26.490 --> 00:56:28.349
Anthony Taylor: And then we're gonna drop the index.

588
00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:36.590
Kevin Nguyen: Okay.

589
00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:37.980
one over

590
00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:41.860
Anthony Taylor: and then we'll print the top 10. So money.

591
00:56:42.590 --> 00:56:44.820
Oh, good delivered.

592
00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:46.900
And

593
00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:48.240
Anthony Taylor: and there you go.

594
00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:53.979
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we got lots of free. Look at all those freak. That's a lot of words right there.

595
00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:58.189
Anthony Taylor: Alright. It's

596
00:57:00.110 --> 00:57:05.030
Anthony Taylor: okay. So what do we have here? So now we're gonna look at documents

597
00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:11.000
Anthony Taylor: and see. Oh, my God, look at this.

598
00:57:11.110 --> 00:57:13.230
Anthony Taylor: Oh, this isn't that bad. Okay?

599
00:57:13.350 --> 00:57:18.799
Anthony Taylor: So first, we're gonna create an empty list. So we'll say, results underscore docs

600
00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:25.899
Anthony Taylor: equals. And we'll make lists. Gotta use a for loop to go through all of our ids in money use id.

601
00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:28.089
Anthony Taylor: So we'll say 4, doc. I

602
00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:30.040
Anthony Taylor: docs id for Doc Id.

603
00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:35.700
michael mcpherson: That's it.

604
00:57:36.010 --> 00:57:37.350
Anthony Taylor: Did I do it again?

605
00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:40.699
Anthony Taylor: Why, Doc? No, that's the name of the list. That's something.

606
00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:41.810
Anthony Taylor: Money.

607
00:57:43.070 --> 00:57:46.080
Anthony Taylor: money news. Ids.

608
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:53.149
Anthony Taylor: Okay, says, use this comprehension. Or for live to extract the words, the document using

609
00:57:53.170 --> 00:57:55.610
Anthony Taylor: waiters. Word stock Id

610
00:57:55.660 --> 00:58:03.650
Anthony Taylor: then populates the list operation additional for any words in lower case matching the terms path to the function.

611
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:06.500
Anthony Taylor: So we're basically going to manually

612
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:09.299
Anthony Taylor: calculate our idea.

613
00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:11.180
Anthony Taylor: All right. So found

614
00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:16.130
Anthony Taylor: terms equals. And here we're going to do

615
00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:19.240
Anthony Taylor: for word in

616
00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:21.380
Anthony Taylor: were and reuters

617
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:25.260
Anthony Taylor: dot words

618
00:58:26.490 --> 00:58:28.210
Anthony Taylor: Doc underscore

619
00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:32.190
Anthony Taylor: Id. And then this filter on

620
00:58:32.590 --> 00:58:34.219
Baro, Sonja: writers.

621
00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:37.719
Baro, Sonja: Thank you, Sonya. Welcome

622
00:58:38.330 --> 00:58:44.530
Anthony Taylor: notice. I didn't say it like that time, either. Now it's spelled correctly. So it's Reuters

623
00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:47.820
Anthony Taylor: or Royas Roy does

624
00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:51.340
Anthony Taylor: okay here

625
00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:53.250
Anthony Taylor: any

626
00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:55.700
Anthony Taylor: term

627
00:58:56.110 --> 00:58:58.440
Anthony Taylor: in word.

628
00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:00.980
Anthony Taylor: dot lower.

629
00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:10.049
Anthony Taylor:  Oh, this is like this is like a 110, my God! 4 term and terms.

630
00:59:10.690 --> 00:59:15.979
Baro, Sonja: Should it be sorry I'm just? No, you might be right where at

631
00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:20.340
Baro, Sonja: under afterwards, Reuters dot words, Doc. Id.

632
00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:26.139
Baro, Sonja: Okay? Oh, it's just me, I add in an S, I'm sorry.

633
00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:40.629
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I did it first. Okay, now. So we're not done with this. But I wanted to make sure everyone understands what's happening. This is kind of like a list comprehension within a list comprehension.

634
00:59:41.890 --> 00:59:49.740
Anthony Taylor: So this, this, if clause we've seen this before, so we have our normal for loop. which we haven't done anything with yet.

635
00:59:50.130 --> 00:59:55.800
Anthony Taylor: and then we have the filter. And this filter says, I want you to loop through the terms

636
00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:07.450
Anthony Taylor: stuff that we have up above. or or are we passing it in that we're passing in? And if that term is, if the lower case of the word

637
01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:09.050
Anthony Taylor: is

638
01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:11.940
Anthony Taylor:  in there.

639
01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:19.919
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I want you to output it. So it's gonna output it back to this for loop, which is gonna simply

640
01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:23.990
Anthony Taylor: put it in the list called found Perks.

641
01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:27.240
Anthony Taylor: Everybody follow that.

642
01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:34.350
Anthony Taylor: I mean, you could even it might even be easier for this one. I did something like this.

643
01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:37.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

644
01:00:40.110 --> 01:00:45.209
Anthony Taylor: so and you kind of read it kind of read it from the bottom. So we have this.

645
01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:47.570
Anthony Taylor: It's going to be our if fuzz.

646
01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:55.369
Anthony Taylor: this is our loop, and it has to. If it. This is true, we're gonna put the word in here which will end up in the list.

647
01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:01.519
Anthony Taylor: Okay. alright. And then at the end of this, we're simply gonna say

648
01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:03.100
if

649
01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:09.330
Anthony Taylor: length of found terms is greater than 0.

650
01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:17.089
Anthony Taylor: Alright. then we're gonna resolve

651
01:01:17.330 --> 01:01:21.850
Anthony Taylor: docs, and append it to that or append the Doc id

652
01:01:22.330 --> 01:01:23.280
Anthony Taylor: to that.

653
01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:27.989
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So all we're trying to do is fill the dock Id, and then we're gonna return

654
01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.179
Anthony Taylor: that. So we can run this?

655
01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:33.070
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

656
01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:39.719
Anthony Taylor: And then. Now to answer these questions, how many articles talk about? Get

657
01:01:40.110 --> 01:01:42.480
Anthony Taylor: okay? So we can do

658
01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:45.560
Anthony Taylor: links. retrieve docs.

659
01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:57.850
Anthony Taylor: which is the function we just created. and in parentheses. And the list put. Oh, I didn't mean to do that.

660
01:01:58.890 --> 01:02:08.469
Anthony Taylor: Yen. Okay. run that. And we could see a hundred 82 of these documents contain the word yet

661
01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:12.590
Anthony Taylor: that's kind of cool, right

662
01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:19.159
Clayton Graves: it it just what documents have the word again, it doesn't tell us how many times again

663
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:21.109
Clayton Graves: appears in each document

664
01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:26.140
Anthony Taylor: correct? Well, I mean, we could go back up here and figure that out.

665
01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:35.510
Anthony Taylor: Well, not really, because this is all of this is just the word period. Yeah, this is really again, more analysis stuff that

666
01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:40.210
Anthony Taylor: I I'm gonna be honest, like, I told.

667
01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:42.609
Anthony Taylor: I really kind of like this.

668
01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:54.899
Anthony Taylor: I think this is neat. This is not something that you normally do. Nor do we normally teach. Okay, we normally just say, this is idf, idf, it takes like minutes.

669
01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:59.600
Anthony Taylor: Okay, tf, idf, is this, here's the function next

670
01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:06.010
Clayton Graves: using these tools, frequency isn't as important as wait. Correct?

671
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.849
Anthony Taylor: Well, frequency helps determine the way. But yes, so. But overall, you're right.

672
01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:18.650
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Way is the ultimate measure that that the model is going to use.

673
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:23.340
Anthony Taylor: How you get that weight is through all of these different preprocessing steps.

674
01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:26.860
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so yeah.

675
01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:33.709
Anthony Taylor: So one more retrieve dots. This one says it wants to know England or dealers.

676
01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:39.889
Anthony Taylor: So again. parentheses brackets. I'm gonna put in the word England

677
01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:44.080
Anthony Taylor: and the word dealers.

678
01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:51.410
Anthony Taylor: One fun thing about this, I mean, you guys might run into a situation where someone says, Oh, my God, we have.

679
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:56.110
Anthony Taylor: you know, 10,000 web pages. Okay.

680
01:03:57.180 --> 01:04:00.960
Anthony Taylor: I wonder how many of those web pages, you know. Talk about this

681
01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:05.759
Anthony Taylor: right? You could consume those web pages.

682
01:04:06.050 --> 01:04:10.600
Anthony Taylor: throw Em into just a regular old count vectorizer. Done.

683
01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:14.530
Anthony Taylor: you know, run this little function right here. Huh?

684
01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:16.669
Anthony Taylor: Okay, yeah. Mike.

685
01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:25.390
michael mcpherson: might that might just be, you know, way, I'm thinking it both questions 2 and 3, it says or

686
01:04:25.610 --> 01:04:28.350
michael mcpherson: and seems to me that the answer is and

687
01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:34.479
michael mcpherson: return. It's going to return an end. So it's Japan and Banks.

688
01:04:35.570 --> 01:04:37.519
michael mcpherson: and not one or the other.

689
01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:43.450
Anthony Taylor: Not according, no, because it says, if you look at the the so terms

690
01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:44.840
michael mcpherson: with an S.

691
01:04:45.010 --> 01:04:48.769
Anthony Taylor: Okay. it's gonna loop through terms

692
01:04:48.910 --> 01:04:53.939
Anthony Taylor: in 4 term in terms. So this first, this would say.

693
01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:56.320
Anthony Taylor: if if Japan

694
01:04:56.490 --> 01:04:58.940
Anthony Taylor: is in here at all.

695
01:04:59.170 --> 01:05:02.860
Anthony Taylor: Pass that out here alright.

696
01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:11.829
Anthony Taylor: and then pass it up to here. So every document that has the word Japan or the word banks will come up based on this loop?

697
01:05:13.770 --> 01:05:15.949
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, partly because of that, Annie.

698
01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:20.510
michael mcpherson: Yeah. But what if you

699
01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:25.719
michael mcpherson: that logically be the sum sum of all

700
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:32.550
michael mcpherson: ones that mentioned Japan and all that mentioned banks.

701
01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:42.600
Anthony Taylor: I would say, the answer is, no. because you would have some that have both words in it, and they would only be counted once.

702
01:05:45.350 --> 01:05:46.210
michael mcpherson: Okay.

703
01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:49.859
Anthony Taylor: yeah. But it's good. I like it. I like it.

704
01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:53.909
Anthony Taylor: That's that's really that's really good critical thinking, I like that.

705
01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:57.230
Anthony Taylor: Okay, any questions.

706
01:05:58.770 --> 01:06:02.199
Anthony Taylor: Sonya, you started to have a question. What happened? Did I accident? Answer it?

707
01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:21.429
Baro, Sonja: No, II figured out what the rough problem was is. My! I was trying to answer the questions with the length, the lens. But the problem was my function. I isn't running right. I'm having issues. So it was never fully defined.

708
01:06:22.410 --> 01:06:28.699
Baro, Sonja: Okay? So I figured out why it wasn't working. But I don't know what's why this other one's not working.

709
01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:31.939
Anthony Taylor: Do you want us to look at it.

710
01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:42.039
Baro, Sonja: No, it's okay. It's it's thinking I haven't closed off stuff. But I have. But anyway, you can keep going. It's probably a quote or so.

711
01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:50.660
Anthony Taylor: all righty. So what's next after this? So again, we're still kind of in this

712
01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:53.450
Anthony Taylor: phase of analysis.

713
01:06:53.790 --> 01:06:59.950
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So the next thing we're gonna look at is text classification. Now, you might be like.

714
01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:05.000
Anthony Taylor: what text classification. Now, this isn't actually a demo.

715
01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:11.810
Anthony Taylor: This is just slides. So this falls into sentiment, analysis.

716
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:23.489
Anthony Taylor: and sentiment analysis. we can use support. Vector, naive phase. I'm hoping we're going to use, or neural networks. No networks can do anything.

717
01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:29.820
Anthony Taylor: 9 bays is another model like random forest, Sbm, etc.

718
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:31.980
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

719
01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:39.869
Anthony Taylor: In most cases this is going to be supervised learning. So we're going to give it examples of positive and negative.

720
01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:42.410
Tweets or

721
01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:47.130
Anthony Taylor: comments messages. you know, weekly report

722
01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:48.960
Anthony Taylor: comments, etc.

723
01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:50.740
Anthony Taylor: And then this

724
01:07:50.900 --> 01:08:01.229
Anthony Taylor: is the are the labels always going to be binary like that positive and negative. No, no, no, they don't have to be, but that will help you determine which model you're going to use.

725
01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:06.000
Clayton Graves: Svm is gonna give you a binding answer. But 90 days

726
01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:09.429
Clayton Graves: have to know your labels ahead of time.

727
01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:14.980
Anthony Taylor: Oh, yeah. Well, you're training the model. So you have to have to sleep. Yes.

728
01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:16.510
Anthony Taylor: yeah.

729
01:08:16.770 --> 01:08:19.990
Anthony Taylor: When you train it, you have to have labeled, yes.

730
01:08:21.830 --> 01:08:22.729
Anthony Taylor: okay.

731
01:08:23.319 --> 01:08:29.189
Anthony Taylor: alright. So here's Svm, it's able to arrange data points in multiple. We've seen Svm, before.

732
01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:30.810
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

733
01:08:31.450 --> 01:08:36.600
Anthony Taylor: it's really nothing exciting to add to that. It can do 3 dimensional space.

734
01:08:36.819 --> 01:08:38.180
Anthony Taylor: which is cool.

735
01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:40.709
Anthony Taylor: And then we have an activity

736
01:08:41.470 --> 01:08:53.029
Anthony Taylor: that doesn't. That doesn't seem like very much stuff. So we have trained to split. Look, there's our old sk learn. I miss you. Sk learn telling you I do. It's so much better than an Ltk.

737
01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:56.410
Anthony Taylor:  So here we go.

738
01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.819
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to pull in this data.

739
01:08:59.310 --> 01:09:07.439
Anthony Taylor: We have this cool thing here. This is just because some of our Pandas, our comments are going to be long. We have

740
01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:20.279
Anthony Taylor: a Csv with commenting. okay, now, the labels that gave it is am or spam by. I really don't know why. This is the data.

741
01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:23.250
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's a lot, though. Look

742
01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:30.069
Anthony Taylor: goes on. 5,000, 6,000, 5,500.

743
01:09:30.779 --> 01:09:36.550
Anthony Taylor: So there's a lot there. Okay?  yeah.

744
01:09:37.170 --> 01:09:43.429
Anthony Taylor: So here, let's get some info about it. The label. It's a text message.

745
01:09:44.819 --> 01:09:47.320
Anthony Taylor: 5,572.

746
01:09:49.890 --> 01:09:58.569
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna do a value counts on the labels. We have 4,825 ham. 747 spam.

747
01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:07.030
Anthony Taylor: We're going to do a train test split. So here, there's only 2 columns here. Guys. text message label.

748
01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:13.770
Anthony Taylor: So X is text message Y is the label train test split

749
01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:19.950
Anthony Taylor: done. We're going to do a Tf id vectorizer

750
01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:25.219
Anthony Taylor: and use and and fit our training data

751
01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:26.270
Anthony Taylor: to it.

752
01:10:27.850 --> 01:10:28.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

753
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:31.880
Anthony Taylor: everybody cool with me on that.

754
01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:35.930
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

755
01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:38.580
Anthony Taylor: And then here.

756
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:45.890
Anthony Taylor:  from sk, learn, we're going to get English. Stop words.

757
01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:50.410
Anthony Taylor: So this is slightly different than the way we did it in in Lt, K.

758
01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:55.839
Anthony Taylor: But I wanna tell you guys in Ltp is fantastic for learning.

759
01:10:55.910 --> 01:11:03.580
Anthony Taylor: That's what it's for. In practice we usually lose like sk learn and tools like that. Okay.

760
01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:15.220
Anthony Taylor: even though Sd learn sounds more like a learning than in Ltk. but it's as K. Learned or or is. Is more often learn for stuff are used for stuff like this.

761
01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:26.249
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but we're still using the same vectorizer. So we're gonna do what we did. We're gonna do the list to get the names, the list unravel to get the frequency.

762
01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:36.899
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna throw those into a data frame. Take a look. Yay. okay. We'll take a look at the bottom words.

763
01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:39.960
Anthony Taylor: alright, pretty cool.

764
01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:41.550
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So

765
01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:54.590
Anthony Taylor: got our data. It's prepped ready to go. Now, we're gonna take our Svc model pass in our training data and our widespread and our labels

766
01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:56.369
Anthony Taylor: and fit our model.

767
01:11:57.610 --> 01:12:02.420
Anthony Taylor: Then we're going to do a prediction on tests. Is this going to work?

768
01:12:05.410 --> 01:12:07.120
Anthony Taylor: No.

769
01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:12.020
Meredith McCanse (she/her): why is it not gonna work we can never do fit transform with the test.

770
01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:15.709
Clayton Graves: you know, we just

771
01:12:16.650 --> 01:12:25.289
Anthony Taylor: right. So these are like squeeze this Christmas. I'll give you like, friendship brought me back right? This, you can't make that into a number.

772
01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:33.360
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so we're going to apply our vectorizer transform to test and

773
01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:38.009
Anthony Taylor: do our same predictions. And now we actually get solved.

774
01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:43.199
Anthony Taylor: Which means now that we have a result, we can get our score.

775
01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:45.519
Anthony Taylor: which is a very good score.

776
01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:49.370
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

777
01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:56.780
Anthony Taylor: So walking through those steps again without this broken one? Not sure, I understand point breaking it like that.

778
01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:09.219
Anthony Taylor: We have. We bring in our messages we're going to do the Tf. Id Vectorizer fit transform. We're gonna add our stopwords, which we didn't even use.

779
01:13:10.130 --> 01:13:11.000
Anthony Taylor: did we?

780
01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:15.199
Anthony Taylor: We haven't even used them yet, is there more to this? Yeah, maybe

781
01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:18.030
Anthony Taylor: we didn't use them so far.

782
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:23.400
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then, once we have our vectorizer stored.

783
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:27.159
Anthony Taylor: actually, we didn't even okay, let's back up.

784
01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:30.610
Anthony Taylor: We didn't use this. Okay.

785
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:36.339
Anthony Taylor:  did we need any of this?

786
01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:48.199
Anthony Taylor: We did not, did. We didn't use any of it. That's just for you to look at. Okay, it's to help with understanding.

787
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:57.380
Anthony Taylor: Not but I wanted to make sure. But I also want you to understand. You only need to do these steps to to do this model. All you needed to do was

788
01:13:57.700 --> 01:13:59.110
Anthony Taylor: vectorize the data.

789
01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:09.699
Anthony Taylor: Okay, once it was vectorized, you're able to pass it into here. Well, probably a train test split it, which I think we did that, too.

790
01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:11.010
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

791
01:14:11.150 --> 01:14:17.719
Anthony Taylor: all right. Moving down. So here we're gonna build a pipeline. So now we're gonna build a pipeline on my

792
01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:33.280
Anthony Taylor: pipeline builders from last project. Okay, what's that mean? We're gonna do pipeline? Tf, ID, this time we're putting in stop words, English. And then the model itself. We're going to use linear Svc.

793
01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:41.269
Anthony Taylor: and then we're gonna fit X train and Y train. This is, gonna do it all for us. It's gonna do the Tf Id and

794
01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:47.909
Anthony Taylor: trainer model. Okay? And now we can test are everything's the same.

795
01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:51.480
Anthony Taylor: So that's cool. Right? Well.

796
01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:53.090
Anthony Taylor: let's go a step further.

797
01:14:54.130 --> 01:14:59.760
Anthony Taylor: So here we're going to predict our test data now, because we use this pipeline.

798
01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:07.560
Anthony Taylor: we don't have to apply the vectorizer to it. It's going to do it in here. So here we can just pass in.

799
01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:13.670
Anthony Taylor: I lost. I lost my place. We could just pass in X test ad is.

800
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:15.979
Anthony Taylor: and we will get the same result.

801
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:20.960
Anthony Taylor: We can also get our classification report

802
01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:23.959
Anthony Taylor: and see how good a job we were doing.

803
01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:26.190
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

804
01:15:27.010 --> 01:15:30.380
Anthony Taylor:  alright. So here's a fun one.

805
01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:33.839
Anthony Taylor: Because we created that nifty little pipeline.

806
01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:39.100
Anthony Taylor: We can actually pass our own text in there

807
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:42.189
Anthony Taylor: and see how it does.

808
01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:50.350
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we can do text. Dl, f dot predict. pass in the blinds and see how it predicts. Now.

809
01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:56.959
Anthony Taylor: I guess it's trying to predict if it's spam or not

810
01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:05.499
Clayton Graves: not, I would say the second text is is

811
01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:10.280
Clayton Graves: spam. Yeah, I don't know. This could be too.

812
01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:12.660
Kanouff, Christine: Yeah, you know it is.

813
01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:16.990
Anthony Taylor: But the the cool thing here is not only did we train it

814
01:16:17.210 --> 01:16:21.959
Anthony Taylor: right? You're able to do predictions right now on real text

815
01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:27.329
Anthony Taylor: because of that little pipeline. Pretty exciting. Huh?

816
01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:30.970
Anthony Taylor: Alright!

817
01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:33.089
Anthony Taylor: Questions about that.

818
01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:35.490
Baro, Sonja: Can you just

819
01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:41.800
Baro, Sonja: go back through that like? So the reason you're saying is, can we get rid of the bad stuff.

820
01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:45.689
Anthony Taylor: How's that set? Would that help, son?

821
01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:53.110
Baro, Sonja: Rid of the unnecessary stuff? Let's say that. Let's get rid of the unnecessary stuff. Go ahead. Ask your question.

822
01:16:53.300 --> 01:17:08.650
Baro, Sonja: Yeah. So the reason we can run the the second part on those those new text messages. The prediction is because we set up the pipeline that had all the functions for running Tfid.

823
01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:12.120
Anthony Taylor: Umhm, is that right? Yeah.

824
01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:13.780
Anthony Taylor: absolutely.

825
01:17:15.630 --> 01:17:24.000
Anthony Taylor: Absolutely. I know it's it's

826
01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:27.620
Anthony Taylor: it's it's difficult sometimes.

827
01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:33.190
Anthony Taylor: is there? Do you guys see duplicate on here. I've got it copy

828
01:17:35.610 --> 01:17:37.370
Anthony Taylor: paste. There we go

829
01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:46.160
Anthony Taylor: alright. So I made a copy of that note. All right, so let's get rid of stuff we don't need in here. So this we need, we need to be able to read the file.

830
01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:52.219
Anthony Taylor: So we have to read the file.

831
01:17:52.230 --> 01:17:56.339
Anthony Taylor: You could do info. You could do value counts. Technically, you don't need them.

832
01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:59.529
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we'll drop those.

833
01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:03.669
Anthony Taylor: We absolutely need to load our x in our Y,

834
01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:06.260
Anthony Taylor: okay, so we'll do that.

835
01:18:08.290 --> 01:18:10.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now.

836
01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:20.170
Anthony Taylor: huh? I'm gonna run this guy for the first example. Then I'm just going to get rid of all this other badge. Okay? Well.

837
01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:24.929
Anthony Taylor: bum, bum, boom. yeah, now we're at the Mall.

838
01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:27.280
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we can run the model.

839
01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:31.510
Anthony Taylor: And we can see the predictions.

840
01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:36.599
Anthony Taylor: That's all you needed. But to make this simpler still.

841
01:18:36.890 --> 01:18:43.219
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're gonna come down here. We're gonna do one more. One different. So we're basically gonna get rid of

842
01:18:43.770 --> 01:18:45.020
Anthony Taylor: this step.

843
01:18:46.710 --> 01:18:48.290
Anthony Taylor: And

844
01:18:49.790 --> 01:18:56.930
Anthony Taylor: this step, no, this step and this step. We're going to combine those into a pipeline right here.

845
01:18:58.090 --> 01:19:05.270
Anthony Taylor: Okay. and that's it, and then fit it and fit the whole pipeline. So basically train the whole pipeline

846
01:19:05.470 --> 01:19:23.439
Baro, Sonja: so we can. Oh, the pipeline, the this code after pipeline here isn't necessarily referencing to anything up above it. Just any other stuff?

847
01:19:24.730 --> 01:19:28.639
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, actually. Oh, well, we do have to do the train test. Split.

848
01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:30.230
Baro, Sonja: Right? That's okay.

849
01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:41.970
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So you have to do the train test split but once A and load X in the Y, but once you get past that, it's this is that vector cell and the linear Svc cell.

850
01:19:42.330 --> 01:19:43.430
Anthony Taylor: Right? You're good.

851
01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:50.660
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then you can do it. You can train it. You can score it. And

852
01:19:51.690 --> 01:19:55.909
Anthony Taylor: you know we could do those. But we don't have to. We can just run predictions right here.

853
01:19:57.660 --> 01:19:59.520
Anthony Taylor: That's all you need that.

854
01:20:00.910 --> 01:20:01.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

855
01:20:02.050 --> 01:20:07.630
Anthony Taylor: all this other stuff is how you do your analysis to make sure it's working.

856
01:20:13.930 --> 01:20:14.990
Anthony Taylor: Make sense.

857
01:20:19.810 --> 01:20:28.240
Derek Rikke: Alright question. I think the answer is, yes. you can run. You can run like multiple pipelines in a pipeline

858
01:20:29.170 --> 01:20:33.010
Derek Rikke: pipelines.

859
01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:38.509
Anthony Taylor: I haven't tried that. I'm not gonna say I'm not gonna say yes or no, cause I don't know for sure.

860
01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:49.410
Anthony Taylor:  I don't know for sure. Why would you wanna do that, though?

861
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:52.259
Derek Rikke: Why would you just keep adding to the existing pipeline?

862
01:20:53.390 --> 01:21:01.769
Derek Rikke: Well, I guess I'm thinking, like the last project we'd have to like split the data up into like categorical and numeric.

863
01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:04.520
Anthony Taylor: like separate data frames.

864
01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:07.650
Derek Rikke: And then you like, do different

865
01:21:08.650 --> 01:21:10.300
Derek Rikke: transformations on

866
01:21:10.610 --> 01:21:13.539
Derek Rikke: those data frames because they're different types.

867
01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:23.059
Anthony Taylor: I think it would just be separate pipelines most. Oh, then you want to bring it back together. You probably would still run a separate pipeline for each, and then bring them back together in another step.

868
01:21:23.450 --> 01:21:28.290
Derek Rikke: right on 2 pipelines. But then, can you just put those 2

869
01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:30.180
Derek Rikke: back into one?

870
01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:34.880
Derek Rikke: I would say, that answer is yes, but I would even

871
01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:38.219
Anthony Taylor: heck I would try it. Look, it's it's it's an array.

872
01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:45.529
Anthony Taylor: so I mean, you might be able to put another array on them. or even Nesta pipeline unit. I don't.

873
01:21:45.710 --> 01:21:47.540
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. I haven't tried that.

874
01:21:47.550 --> 01:21:48.879
Anthony Taylor: so I don't know the answer.

875
01:21:49.490 --> 01:21:53.300
Anthony Taylor: but it's a great one. I'd like you to look it up. Derek, come back and tell you

876
01:21:53.490 --> 01:21:54.330
Derek Rikke: definitely.

877
01:21:55.090 --> 01:21:58.519
Anthony Taylor: I like that alright cool any other questions on this.

878
01:22:01.780 --> 01:22:06.889
Anthony Taylor: So let's look at the movie one and see if it's something reasonable.

879
01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:19.599
Anthony Taylor: It's a lot of steps. So you're gonna load the data set. That's easy check for missing values. Get a sample review number of positively so value counts.

880
01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:23.170
Anthony Taylor: You're gonna

881
01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:36.630
Anthony Taylor: get your label, get your features, do train, test, split. build a pipeline without stop words and linear as you see fit. The model validate predict anything.

882
01:22:39.790 --> 01:22:40.900
Anthony Taylor: Jesus.

883
01:22:42.930 --> 01:22:45.119
Anthony Taylor: and how long am I giving them for this?

884
01:22:48.230 --> 01:22:52.340
Anthony Taylor: This stuff makes me laugh. So the other day, guys, we were doing

885
01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:55.229
Anthony Taylor: whatever we were doing last week.

886
01:22:57.580 --> 01:23:03.259
Anthony Taylor: They were telling me, give you 15 min to do an activity that should pick you like 3 min to do.

887
01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:10.280
Anthony Taylor: And then I look at this, and I'm like this is a lot.

888
01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:20.619
Anthony Taylor: No, I think you could do it. There's nothing hard, I mean, everything's there. Same thing. It's just it's like copy and paste a lot of it. But they do give you 25 min. Do this.

889
01:23:21.410 --> 01:23:27.449
Anthony Taylor:  there are some harder ones coming.

890
01:23:28.490 --> 01:23:38.930
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. Do you guys want to do this once? Everyone and then do break. And then I'm gonna make you guys do the hardest one today by yourself? Or do you want to do this one yourself, and we'll do the other one as everybody.

891
01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:45.689
Baro, Sonja: They're the same. I'll wheel and deal. They're the same to me.

892
01:23:46.710 --> 01:23:48.599
Mason, Natalie: Been the wheel of doom.

893
01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:55.390
Anthony Taylor: I don't have time for wheel spinning.

894
01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:58.189
Anthony Taylor: Let's let's do this one

895
01:23:58.430 --> 01:24:05.269
Anthony Taylor: just real quick, and then we'll we'll go to break after. And you guys will be happy, I think.

896
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:18.060
Anthony Taylor: cause these are not. I mean, like, I said today, the one thing I noted as I was reviewing all material. I'm like, my God, every one of these

897
01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:22.810
Anthony Taylor: activities are. It's just a lot. It's not even that there are.

898
01:24:22.850 --> 01:24:24.140
Anthony Taylor: It's just a lot.

899
01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:31.829
Anthony Taylor: And it's like they're never gonna get these done in the time allotted alright. So we're gonna read this.

900
01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:34.290
Anthony Taylor: Well, yeah.

901
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:39.749
Anthony Taylor: But the the crazy thing is, I mean, as you guys are going to see as we go through this

902
01:24:40.150 --> 01:24:46.849
Anthony Taylor: it it's not that the the content is hard, cause it's mostly you're just gonna repeat the same thing over and over.

903
01:24:46.990 --> 01:24:48.400
Clayton Graves: It's just like

904
01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:51.099
Clayton Graves: the exercise. It's just a lot of type.

905
01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:54.329
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So here, let's run this one

906
01:24:58.370 --> 01:25:01.679
Anthony Taylor: and not that. I type any faster than you guys do. But

907
01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:06.890
Clayton Graves: at least I can, you know, get us there sometimes.

908
01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:12.660
Anthony Taylor: Imdb, you know. But I do have the answer. So that helps.

909
01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:25.609
Anthony Taylor: So here we can see we have 748 items. Yay. okay, they're both non-nullable. So we don't really have to worry about nullable

910
01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:28.170
we can grab one

911
01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:31.490
Anthony Taylor: of the records if you wanted to. So we could say.

912
01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:41.329
Clayton Graves: this part trip. Me for Chat Gp, to remind me of code goes. But it's

913
01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:42.410
Anthony Taylor: hold what?

914
01:25:42.730 --> 01:25:45.170
Clayton Graves: Just just just the the

915
01:25:45.370 --> 01:25:47.359
Clayton Graves: Df dot sample.

916
01:25:49.670 --> 01:25:52.969
Clayton Graves: Okay. just just that part.

917
01:25:53.880 --> 01:26:01.280
Anthony Taylor: I just wanted to see one record. So what to say, attempting ardiness with black and white and clever camera angles. The movie, disappointed.

918
01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:06.969
Anthony Taylor: became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot line almost nonexistent.

919
01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:12.280
Anthony Taylor: I don't know what movie is that I really wanna know what movie that is.

920
01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:18.830
Anthony Taylor: it doesn't say, Huh!

921
01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:21.630
Anthony Taylor: That disappoints me. Okay.

922
01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:34.780
Clayton Graves: then we're gonna do the value counts. So I did that a little bit different because I had Chad Cpt help me. I did a sample. Underscore reviews equals movie review df, dot sample.

923
01:26:35.250 --> 01:26:41.379
Clayton Graves: And then I set M. One, and then I did a print, and it gave me the label and the review.

924
01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:47.199
Anthony Taylor: Okay. that's a lot. I mean, nothing wrong with it. But it's a lot

925
01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:53.600
Anthony Taylor: would always. But you know what? That's just because the way they ask for it, they should have said, just return one review.

926
01:26:54.460 --> 01:27:00.149
Mason, Natalie: right? And that would have been better. Yeah, Natalie, can you scroll up a couple of cells. I missed something.

927
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:08.030
Mason, Natalie:  got it? Got it? Okay. Thank you.

928
01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:13.330
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So we can see what we got. So let's create our X

929
01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:16.700
Anthony Taylor: right? So X is going to be the review.

930
01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:26.850
Anthony Taylor: That's not too bad, right? We only got 2 columns. So we know that X is the review. and Y is going to be the label

931
01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:29.900
Anthony Taylor: alright.

932
01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:40.460
Anthony Taylor: And then we're gonna do our train test split. So X underscore train comma x. I'm just

933
01:27:40.890 --> 01:27:47.019
Anthony Taylor: y and screen Y underscore test equals

934
01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:52.990
Anthony Taylor: train test splits X comma. Y. Come on.

935
01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:56.719
Anthony Taylor: I don't know why they're doing test sizes not necessary, but whatever

936
01:27:57.010 --> 01:28:01.320
Anthony Taylor: test size equals point 30. So they're gonna split it 7, 30.

937
01:28:01.370 --> 01:28:05.360
Anthony Taylor: And random state is 22. Okay.

938
01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:09.759
Anthony Taylor: so that gives us that. So here we're going to build pipeline

939
01:28:11.010 --> 01:28:15.099
Anthony Taylor: like we did earlier. So we'll call this one text

940
01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:18.560
Anthony Taylor: underscore clf

941
01:28:18.730 --> 01:28:20.970
Anthony Taylor: equals pipeline.

942
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:34.429
Anthony Taylor: And in the pipeline we're gonna put need to put a list objects and a parentheses. And we're going to say, TF.

943
01:28:36.030 --> 01:28:42.210
Anthony Taylor: I, DF in quotes. That's what we're gonna call it the

944
01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:48.129
Anthony Taylor: comma TF vectorizer.

945
01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:56.420
Anthony Taylor: And remember, you just do open close cause we're not doing. Stop words on this one. And then

946
01:28:56.750 --> 01:28:59.799
Anthony Taylor: so outside the parentheses and do

947
01:29:00.310 --> 01:29:03.450
Anthony Taylor: the model itself. Clf.

948
01:29:05.630 --> 01:29:08.340
Anthony Taylor: comma linear. Svc

949
01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:10.820
Anthony Taylor: opencourse.

950
01:29:11.850 --> 01:29:17.520
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So that gave us our cute little pipeline. Wait, I think we need one more comma.

951
01:29:17.950 --> 01:29:20.200
Anthony Taylor: just to show it's over. Okay.

952
01:29:21.090 --> 01:29:32.289
Anthony Taylor: And now we're going to fit it. So we do. Text CLF, dot fit pass in training data. Think I have an extra space in there? Don't worry.

953
01:29:37.750 --> 01:29:38.810
Anthony Taylor: And there we go

954
01:29:39.890 --> 01:29:40.910
Anthony Taylor: pretty cool.

955
01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:45.310
Anthony Taylor: Last. We can just

956
01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:50.160
Anthony Taylor: do the accuracy. So we can say.

957
01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:53.529
Anthony Taylor: text, clf, dot score.

958
01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:57.419
Anthony Taylor: I only care about test data

959
01:30:06.830 --> 01:30:09.170
Anthony Taylor: 74, not shabby.

960
01:30:11.650 --> 01:30:12.870
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

961
01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:20.420
Anthony Taylor: so what do we got next year? Run predictions? Alright. So we've scored it. So let's do some predictions.

962
01:30:20.570 --> 01:30:24.410
Anthony Taylor: So test underscore predictions

963
01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:28.849
Anthony Taylor: equals text underscore clf.

964
01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:44.480
Anthony Taylor: dot predict pass an X underscore test and then we'll print test predictions and we'll just print them. Oh, that's a lot. But there.

965
01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:46.190
Anthony Taylor: alright!

966
01:30:46.290 --> 01:30:49.769
Anthony Taylor: Now, we can create our matrix and all of that good stuff.

967
01:30:49.950 --> 01:30:55.729
Baro, Sonja: And you pop back up real quick.

968
01:30:55.970 --> 01:31:01.010
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna copy and paste this prediction stuff or the scoring stuff for you guys.

969
01:31:01.510 --> 01:31:05.879
Baro, Sonja: I don't have to type all of that.

970
01:31:08.170 --> 01:31:10.660
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So here.

971
01:31:13.180 --> 01:31:20.699
Anthony Taylor: So yeah, I put that in the slack. So you guys don't have to type at all. Run that we get our confusion matrix

972
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:23.389
Anthony Taylor: and are

973
01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:25.760
Anthony Taylor: poor.

974
01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:30.630
Anthony Taylor: really exciting. Okay, so here we get to add a moving review.

975
01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:31.889
Anthony Taylor: I don't know.

976
01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:50.259
Anthony Taylor: Oh, this might be way too long.

977
01:31:52.090 --> 01:31:53.240
Anthony Taylor: Okay, stop

978
01:31:56.250 --> 01:32:00.850
Anthony Taylor: 2 line, a roadhouse.

979
01:32:01.810 --> 01:32:03.960
Anthony Taylor: Anybody watch the new road house yet?

980
01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:07.650
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

981
01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:13.179
Anthony Taylor: So here we got movie review.

982
01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:22.589
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna get rid of these extra quotes just because

983
01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:27.100
Anthony Taylor: they might give us an issue. And then

984
01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:31.020
Anthony Taylor: we're going to do a text. Clf.

985
01:32:31.470 --> 01:32:36.479
Anthony Taylor:  text underscore clf, dot predict

986
01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:40.690
Anthony Taylor: pass in movie review.

987
01:32:41.230 --> 01:32:45.189
Anthony Taylor: Oh, I missed something how I could give this extra space.

988
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:50.080
Anthony Taylor: And oh.

989
01:32:51.390 --> 01:32:55.840
Anthony Taylor: remember to put brackets around the skies. Keep forgetting to do that

990
01:33:00.180 --> 01:33:01.180
Anthony Taylor: positive.

991
01:33:01.530 --> 01:33:06.059
Anthony Taylor: I didn't even read it delivers a potent mix of action and charisma

992
01:33:06.270 --> 01:33:12.499
Anthony Taylor: with Patrick swayze magnetic performance, elevating it beyond beard bar rolls

993
01:33:12.780 --> 01:33:15.320
Anthony Taylor: to a cult classic with art and bridge.

994
01:33:15.650 --> 01:33:17.430
Anthony Taylor: I guess. So that's pretty possible.

995
01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:23.380
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so what it wants is to do down here.

996
01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:25.330
Anthony Taylor: It's like

997
01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:30.200
Anthony Taylor: this is so much okay?

998
01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:34.759
Anthony Taylor: so basically go up to your pipeline

999
01:33:37.350 --> 01:33:38.670
Anthony Taylor: copy this.

1000
01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:48.720
Anthony Taylor: bring it to here and inside. Here. put stop words equals English.

1001
01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:56.450
Anthony Taylor: That's what that cell was.

1002
01:33:56.680 --> 01:34:01.219
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And then here, it's literally just having you do the same thing all over.

1003
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:10.729
Anthony Taylor: We don't need to do score. You can. If you want for the predictions.

1004
01:34:11.090 --> 01:34:15.110
Anthony Taylor: we can do tests, predictions.

1005
01:34:15.250 --> 01:34:17.189
Anthony Taylor: Underscore 2,

1006
01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:23.070
Anthony Taylor: and this will be ta! Oh, oh, darn it. I just overwrote that model. But that's okay

1007
01:34:23.420 --> 01:34:26.059
Anthony Taylor: techcl, f dot.

1008
01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:27.760
Anthony Taylor: predict

1009
01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:30.900
Anthony Taylor: and pass in your testing data

1010
01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:37.000
Anthony Taylor:  France

1011
01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:39.240
Anthony Taylor: test predictions to

1012
01:34:40.650 --> 01:34:49.339
Anthony Taylor: Kang. Okay, we can do the same, scoring exactly the same scoring as we did here.

1013
01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:55.910
Anthony Taylor: so feel free to grab this. Take it down here.

1014
01:34:59.070 --> 01:35:00.880
Anthony Taylor: paste it, run it

1015
01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:04.620
Anthony Taylor: beautiful! Did it get any better? 77, 71.

1016
01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:08.500
Anthony Taylor: No, didn't even get any better.

1017
01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:10.270
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

1018
01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:21.309
Anthony Taylor: Oh, okay. So now, it wants us to do the same review. So these 2 cells again.

1019
01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:28.449
Anthony Taylor: But we already have the review. So really, all we need is this slide.

1020
01:35:29.090 --> 01:35:34.210
Anthony Taylor: And since I accidentally overwrote it, we can do the same thing. So

1021
01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:38.310
Anthony Taylor: did the review change. What?

1022
01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:42.520
Anthony Taylor: Why do you think it changed?

1023
01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:57.209
Baro, Sonja: What were the stop words? That was not the only regular English stop words right? The regular English stop words.

1024
01:35:58.610 --> 01:36:01.249
Anthony Taylor: and of course we can't see them all. But

1025
01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:07.959
Anthony Taylor: roadhouse delivers potent action, charisma.

1026
01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:10.879
Anthony Taylor: Patrick swayze performance.

1027
01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:14.019
Anthony Taylor: elevating bar room brawls.

1028
01:36:14.250 --> 01:36:19.780
Anthony Taylor: cult, classic heart and bread thrilling ride. Oh.

1029
01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:24.980
Anthony Taylor: maybe because there's so, we only change that one thing right?

1030
01:36:25.190 --> 01:36:27.980
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, we just added English, stop words.

1031
01:36:31.230 --> 01:36:34.770
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. I mean, I do know. That's what changed.

1032
01:36:34.850 --> 01:36:47.789
Anthony Taylor: but it changed it when it, you know it caused us to do that. So that's something to be aware of without the stop words. Maybe it would make sense. I know that would be hard to do right. We'd have to go and find all the stop words and

1033
01:36:47.860 --> 01:36:52.439
Anthony Taylor: do all that. I will do this. There's a sample one here

1034
01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:58.889
Anthony Taylor: that. We can use that works a little better for this.

1035
01:36:59.340 --> 01:37:01.330
Anthony Taylor: Here. I'm gonna grab this one.

1036
01:37:01.530 --> 01:37:09.310
Baro, Sonja: It's like, yesterday when we separated 54 and took the hyphen out.

1037
01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:20.939
Baro, Sonja: it completely changes the context. So maybe there's something about the stop words that are what pushed it into the positive.

1038
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:23.709
Baro, Sonja: the company entirely placement.

1039
01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:27.149
Anthony Taylor: So I changed it to this Barbie one.

1040
01:37:27.730 --> 01:37:37.230
Anthony Taylor: which is, I was curious to see how they would evolve the stereotypical Barbie into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed, and it completely lost the fly.

1041
01:37:37.270 --> 01:37:42.689
Anthony Taylor: I consider myself a proponent of gender equality. This ain't the way to get it

1042
01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:45.480
Anthony Taylor: that came out as positive.

1043
01:37:45.630 --> 01:37:48.499
Clayton Graves: Whoever wrote that as an idiot. But

1044
01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:51.330
Clayton Graves: yeah, that

1045
01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:55.880
Anthony Taylor: I didn't care. I've never even seen it.

1046
01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:58.479
Clayton Graves: I'm moving awesome.

1047
01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:00.209
Anthony Taylor: It's pretty good

1048
01:38:01.150 --> 01:38:08.790
Anthony Taylor: now. Y'all are breaking my heart. I want to go see it pretty good. Alright. So here we're gonna add a bunch more. Stop words.

1049
01:38:08.980 --> 01:38:15.220
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And again, all we need to do is come back up here, copy our pipeline

1050
01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:25.289
Anthony Taylor: alright. but remember to rename it this time. Not like I did last time. We'll name this 1 3,

1051
01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:31.610
Anthony Taylor: and we're gonna change the stop words to be our custom stop words.

1052
01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:39.749
Anthony Taylor: So the ones we just put up there. Okay, these guys. alright. So we're going to run that

1053
01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:48.059
Anthony Taylor:  we can. We can do the score if we want. But here, let's get some predictions

1054
01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:59.050
Anthony Taylor:  So this you know what I'll just do sport here just to keep it above the Internet dot score.

1055
01:39:00.810 --> 01:39:02.979
Anthony Taylor: It's not that it's the other one.

1056
01:39:03.660 --> 01:39:04.590
Anthony Taylor: There you go.

1057
01:39:05.570 --> 01:39:07.770
That's actually not helpful at all, is it?

1058
01:39:08.990 --> 01:39:12.659
Anthony Taylor: That's so funny. Oh, I didn't pass any data into it.

1059
01:39:12.770 --> 01:39:13.650
Anthony Taylor: Ha, ha!

1060
01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.749
Anthony Taylor: I start losing my ability to type after about 20 cells.

1061
01:39:30.910 --> 01:39:34.860
Anthony Taylor: Okay, come on, really, what am I missing? Text? Clf.

1062
01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:38.730
Anthony Taylor: 3. Is that not what I called it? 3

1063
01:39:40.610 --> 01:39:48.149
Anthony Taylor: dot score text train our X test. Comma y test. That's what I did the first time.

1064
01:39:51.730 --> 01:39:53.049
Anthony Taylor: Alright! What's it, saying.

1065
01:39:54.350 --> 01:39:55.560
Anthony Taylor: Oh.

1066
01:39:58.860 --> 01:39:59.939
Anthony Taylor: what happened here?

1067
01:40:02.810 --> 01:40:07.019
Derek Rikke: You didn't fit? You didn't change the name for the fit one.

1068
01:40:07.850 --> 01:40:09.670
Derek Rikke: You add the 3 on that line

1069
01:40:11.060 --> 01:40:17.090
Derek Rikke: under the one right below that line.

1070
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:22.939
Anthony Taylor: I love it when you guys do that. Okay, so there we go. We got our score. Thank you so much, sir.

1071
01:40:23.090 --> 01:40:28.929
Anthony Taylor: And here, we're gonna do text. That's

1072
01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:32.510
Anthony Taylor: that's done. Okay, predict

1073
01:40:33.290 --> 01:40:38.169
Anthony Taylor: X underscore test. We'll just show it. Yeah, there we go. We don't have to print it out.

1074
01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:43.949
Anthony Taylor: and I could do that. So let's do our same. Review our same

1075
01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:46.880
Anthony Taylor: prediction on our full review

1076
01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:54.870
Anthony Taylor: for this new stop words and see how it comes out

1077
01:40:55.900 --> 01:40:57.940
Anthony Taylor: positive again.

1078
01:40:58.590 --> 01:41:00.250
Anthony Taylor: Interesting.

1079
01:41:01.460 --> 01:41:15.040
Anthony Taylor:  pay about, and  so so on. How you look at it. But again you could put stop working and change it. That was kind of moral of that story.

1080
01:41:17.550 --> 01:41:18.210
Anthony Taylor: Oh.

1081
01:41:18.530 --> 01:41:24.350
Anthony Taylor: so while that look like a lot to be honest, guys think about it, we just repeated the same thing like 3 times

1082
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:26.130
Anthony Taylor: changing one variable

1083
01:41:27.470 --> 01:41:28.680
Anthony Taylor: the stoppage

1084
01:41:28.860 --> 01:41:32.080
Anthony Taylor: so they could again, this is one of those.

1085
01:41:33.310 --> 01:41:37.299
Anthony Taylor: But that's that's it. You guys ready for break. Ian.

1086
01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:40.570
Anthony Taylor: Hi, cool! Come back at 30 after

1087
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:44.310
Anthony Taylor: fuck.

1088
01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:48.450
Anthony Taylor: Let's get ready to rumble.

1089
01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:51.890
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

1090
01:41:54.130 --> 01:41:59.589
Anthony Taylor: We're doing good guys. We actually are doing pretty good. So now we're gonna do some pos tagging.

1091
01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:04.360
Mason, Natalie: Go ahead, start your chats. Would you call me

1092
01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:08.860
Anthony Taylor: Pos tagging

1093
01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:12.229
Anthony Taylor: while you may think

1094
01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:17.579
Anthony Taylor: that means something else. What it really means

1095
01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:21.259
Anthony Taylor: is parts of speech tagging.

1096
01:42:21.370 --> 01:42:22.320
Anthony Taylor: Now.

1097
01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:25.130
Anthony Taylor: this is another one.

1098
01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:30.730
Anthony Taylor: You don't even use this when you're doing text classification.

1099
01:42:31.410 --> 01:42:32.959
Anthony Taylor: But

1100
01:42:33.310 --> 01:42:39.099
Anthony Taylor: it's really cool. Oh, wait. Oh, wait, wait, wait! Wait! I have a slide show to talk about before I show you this

1101
01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:49.199
Anthony Taylor: or while I show you this. So we're gonna it's it's a library called Package, called Spacey, not like Kevin Spacey. So get all upset.

1102
01:42:49.710 --> 01:42:54.389
Clayton Graves: Okay, Spacey, like Lacrosse.

1103
01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:57.419
Anthony Taylor: What was that like?

1104
01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:03.930
Clayton Graves: I was thinking, you and spacey like Mccross. I never heard of that robotech.

1105
01:43:04.620 --> 01:43:07.269
Anthony Taylor: Oh, okay, old enemy. I

1106
01:43:07.730 --> 01:43:12.310
Anthony Taylor: alright. Well, I like. Okay. So

1107
01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:24.600
Anthony Taylor: Spacey is is way stronger than NL, tk, core functions depend on language models. Learn? It's accurate. It's intended for educational and prototype.

1108
01:43:24.900 --> 01:43:26.690
Anthony Taylor: Spacey

1109
01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:33.369
Anthony Taylor: way, faster way, more flexible. Designed specifically for production use. So it's kind of a cool library.

1110
01:43:33.610 --> 01:43:35.920
Anthony Taylor: But one of the things that we're going to look at.

1111
01:43:37.550 --> 01:43:42.400
Anthony Taylor: Well, actually, all 3 of these things is pos tagging parts of speech.

1112
01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:43.970
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1113
01:43:44.100 --> 01:43:54.570
Anthony Taylor: named entity, recognition and tendencies parsing. So this isn't one of those really cool things. Again, it's great for data analysis.

1114
01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:56.910
Anthony Taylor: And

1115
01:43:56.940 --> 01:44:00.960
Anthony Taylor: now you can use it for tokenization and limitization.

1116
01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:11.909
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but we already did it within Ltk, but you could if you wanted to. In comparison, basic language models, trade accuracy for speak

1117
01:44:13.390 --> 01:44:18.990
Anthony Taylor: language models don't always have to be at right. We're and we're not that upset if they're off. Usually.

1118
01:44:19.300 --> 01:44:27.460
Anthony Taylor: So. One of the reasons why this is good. So if the corpus is large, you may prefer the simpler, rule-based solution

1119
01:44:28.990 --> 01:44:38.060
Anthony Taylor: that that that was so. Oh, actually, here we go. Okay. So what is parts of speech? Well, how many English majors do I got in here?

1120
01:44:39.780 --> 01:44:42.000
Anthony Taylor: How many people speak English?

1121
01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:50.069
Baro, Sonja: Alright, we got a few of those. Okay. Diagram, a sentence.

1122
01:44:50.570 --> 01:44:55.640
Anthony Taylor: Well, the good news is we don't because basic won't do it for us.

1123
01:44:55.850 --> 01:45:06.669
Anthony Taylor: But basically, parts of speech, we have subjects. We have verbs, we have objects, we have prepositions we have describe. Or this is like all this crazy stuff. Okay?

1124
01:45:06.730 --> 01:45:13.209
Anthony Taylor: And I mean, you can see there. Okay, blah, blah, blah! I'm not gonna do grammar lessons. That's definitely not my place.

1125
01:45:13.850 --> 01:45:17.700
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I'm an old Southern guy. I don't do grammar

1126
01:45:18.460 --> 01:45:22.960
Anthony Taylor: alright or, as as Schwarzenegger would say, Grandma.

1127
01:45:24.170 --> 01:45:26.149
Anthony Taylor: I just don't do. Okay.

1128
01:45:26.950 --> 01:45:31.720
Anthony Taylor: wait a minute. That would be he doesn't do, grandma. That's really

1129
01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:34.820
Anthony Taylor: not appropriate. Okay, so

1130
01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:37.500
Anthony Taylor: we are going to do it

1131
01:45:38.230 --> 01:45:47.740
Anthony Taylor: in here. There's a couple of things you're gonna need to do. You need to pip install spacey. And then you need to do this as well. I'm gonna put this

1132
01:45:48.410 --> 01:45:54.780
Anthony Taylor: in slack. You want to do this in your terminal. probably in

1133
01:45:55.270 --> 01:46:00.379
Anthony Taylor: within Vs codes terminal, so that you are sure you get it.

1134
01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:02.230
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1135
01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:12.699
Anthony Taylor: what? The heck is all over your laptop? That's Dolly a Barbie.

1136
01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:15.100
Mason, Natalie: She's on there, too.

1137
01:46:15.770 --> 01:46:29.629
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Oh, I see her down there in the corner. Dolly's the piston. Okay? So you want to do these 2 things right as we get started. That'll help you along if you don't do those 2 things. You won't even be able to run the first set.

1138
01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:30.800
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

1139
01:46:31.170 --> 01:46:37.759
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna import Spacey. We're gonna import or load a small English English

1140
01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:39.510
Anthony Taylor: language model

1141
01:46:40.850 --> 01:46:44.699
Mason, Natalie: didn't work for me to say an invalid. Zoom patch.

1142
01:46:45.010 --> 01:46:50.949
Mason, Natalie: Did you do this? Did you? Did you install spacing? Yep.

1143
01:46:51.370 --> 01:46:53.359
Mason, Natalie: put an exclamation point

1144
01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:54.840
michael mcpherson: in front of the

1145
01:46:55.180 --> 01:46:58.410
Anthony Taylor: no, don't do it in your cell at all. This you would do in terminal.

1146
01:46:59.420 --> 01:47:00.290
Mason, Natalie: Oh.

1147
01:47:00.740 --> 01:47:06.979
Anthony Taylor: yeah, yeah, this one you do in terminal. This one you could do in the cell, pip, install space.

1148
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:09.039
Anthony Taylor: I don't know why I didn't have space here.

1149
01:47:09.710 --> 01:47:10.469
there you go.

1150
01:47:11.610 --> 01:47:18.859
Baro, Sonja: Can you? Can you say that one more time? What are we putting into terminal versus in the

1151
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:23.210
Anthony Taylor: copy it? Just go to Terminal and

1152
01:47:23.370 --> 01:47:25.219
Anthony Taylor: and then just paste it right there. And what?

1153
01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:31.069
Baro, Sonja: So I'm getting no module named Spacey.

1154
01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:32.259
Baro, Sonja: When I do that.

1155
01:47:33.710 --> 01:47:36.240
Anthony Taylor: maybe Pip install it first.

1156
01:47:37.060 --> 01:47:39.169
Baro, Sonja: That's what I had started. Okay.

1157
01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:44.670
Anthony Taylor: that would make sense. Pip. Install it first.

1158
01:47:45.890 --> 01:47:54.539
Clayton Graves: and you can pip install in terminal, too. But either one it did do the pip install. It still came up with no module namespace

1159
01:47:55.110 --> 01:47:57.850
Anthony Taylor: you probably haven't figured wrong. That

1160
01:47:59.530 --> 01:48:03.700
Anthony Taylor: so show me your screen.

1161
01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:11.270
Masarirambi, Rodney: Who is a Mac?

1162
01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:14.050
Clayton Graves: Who? Me?

1163
01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:24.120
Anthony Taylor: He doesn't have a Mac. He has a PC. It's a good thing, or I'd have to send him to a breakout room with Kevin for half an hour.

1164
01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:29.340
Clayton Graves: I think I may have fixed it. But hold on. Oh, okay. Well, then, don't worry about it. Anybody else having the issue.

1165
01:48:29.730 --> 01:48:31.759
Mason, Natalie: I'm still having issues

1166
01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:34.040
Anthony Taylor: alright. Now, Gabe.

1167
01:48:34.090 --> 01:48:40.920
Mason, Natalie: always at Natalie. You show me your show. So it's so is your screen.

1168
01:48:41.290 --> 01:48:45.450
Mason, Natalie: the front of it this time not back. Share screen.

1169
01:48:46.770 --> 01:48:55.169
Mason, Natalie: Anthony. I love how you're trying to like. Move this along, and we just keep stopping you every single step.

1170
01:48:55.310 --> 01:48:59.300
Masarirambi, Rodney: It's like the slideshow.

1171
01:48:59.310 --> 01:49:02.119
Anthony Taylor: So why do you not have python available?

1172
01:49:02.730 --> 01:49:07.080
Mason, Natalie: How is that even possible.

1173
01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:13.829
Anthony Taylor: Did, did, did did the exclamation point work in the cell guys? Whoever said that

1174
01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:19.629
Anthony Taylor: I didn't even try it? Does it work in this one? What an exclamation point.

1175
01:49:20.610 --> 01:49:24.519
Anthony Taylor: Put it there, exclamate.

1176
01:49:24.730 --> 01:49:28.689
Anthony Taylor: oh, wait! No, you did it. Never mind. No, you did it. Stop! Don't push, stop!

1177
01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:30.560
Anthony Taylor: Don't push. Stop!

1178
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:40.639
Anthony Taylor: Okay, good. Then you're okay, close your term. But the fact that your terminal does not have access to python right now is disturbing at week.

1179
01:49:41.250 --> 01:49:43.370
Mason, Natalie: Why not? Why.

1180
01:49:44.590 --> 01:49:45.439
Anthony Taylor: I don't know.

1181
01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:51.210
Anthony Taylor: You probably should meet with Kevin before class one day and ask

1182
01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:59.150
Raugewitz, Tania: so when I did when I did terminal python is not available. But then I remember to have to go to anaconda terminal, and then it's available.

1183
01:49:59.250 --> 01:50:05.050
Anthony Taylor: That work for that's right. Yours? Yes, yours was configured. But you can do it in the cell with the estimation point.

1184
01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:09.110
Anthony Taylor: I wasn't sure you could, so you can. But you're okay.

1185
01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:16.259
michael mcpherson: The exclamation point tells it not to run it in notebook, but to run that line internally.

1186
01:50:16.780 --> 01:50:21.629
Anthony Taylor: Well, I've always use estimation point for, like Pip install. But I thought you could run the python

1187
01:50:21.650 --> 01:50:25.119
Anthony Taylor: executable from the notebook, but I'm glad I know that

1188
01:50:25.730 --> 01:50:28.500
Anthony Taylor: I never bothered anybody else.

1189
01:50:30.700 --> 01:50:32.029
Anthony Taylor: All right, let's keep moving.

1190
01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:38.559
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So we've installed the spacing core English small.

1191
01:50:38.670 --> 01:50:42.619
Anthony Taylor: and we're ready to move on. So here we have a set.

1192
01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:50.060
Anthony Taylor: The brown cow tipped over the brown moon. Now, my English major. who was my English majors again.

1193
01:50:53.500 --> 01:50:56.870
Masarirambi, Rodney: No, but that's part of the no matter.

1194
01:50:57.870 --> 01:51:00.910
Anthony Taylor: Rodney is our English major. I knew it

1195
01:51:02.010 --> 01:51:08.419
Masarirambi, Rodney: English, Major, but I'm kind of a gram or not. See

1196
01:51:08.930 --> 01:51:12.920
Anthony Taylor: there we go. Grammar man. Alright. So here we have.

1197
01:51:12.970 --> 01:51:20.020
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to tokenize it using the Nlp method. And that's gonna come from Spacey.

1198
01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:23.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And

1199
01:51:23.870 --> 01:51:25.890
Anthony Taylor: we're going to print

1200
01:51:26.270 --> 01:51:33.160
Anthony Taylor: the pos tag. I can't. You know what goes in my mind with Pos. Just so you guys know not what you're thinking.

1201
01:51:33.210 --> 01:51:34.590
Anthony Taylor: but point of sale.

1202
01:51:34.840 --> 01:51:45.380
Anthony Taylor: I don't know why it just doesn't pos tag for each token. So this is list comprehension, we're gonna say, for token in tokens

1203
01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:50.120
Anthony Taylor: print the text plus the pos output.

1204
01:51:50.210 --> 01:51:51.529
Anthony Taylor: and we get

1205
01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:53.720
Anthony Taylor: this. The

1206
01:51:54.020 --> 01:51:57.900
Anthony Taylor: brown. It's an adjudicate bow isn't bound to superb

1207
01:51:57.910 --> 01:52:00.369
Anthony Taylor: over. Is that preposition?

1208
01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:07.829
Anthony Taylor: The is determinant. I wait. You know what I had to go look this up because I'm like what the heck is a DET.

1209
01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:09.770
Anthony Taylor: Here is the.

1210
01:52:11.650 --> 01:52:13.649
Anthony Taylor: I'll put this link in slack.

1211
01:52:18.820 --> 01:52:21.729
Anthony Taylor: This is basically the documentation for spacing.

1212
01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:31.219
Anthony Taylor: but it has some. It it does explain what the et is round. Additive. Move now and then. See how it's pretty cool.

1213
01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:36.509
Anthony Taylor: Okay. How many of us would have loved to have had this in English class.

1214
01:52:37.790 --> 01:52:40.320
Anthony Taylor: I would have liked to have had it, but it gets better.

1215
01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:51.669
Anthony Taylor: it really does. So we could actually say, Give me all the noun, so we can say for token and tokens. If tokens Pos is now return it. We can see just the noun.

1216
01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:55.339
Anthony Taylor: Okay. We can see.

1217
01:52:55.440 --> 01:53:01.090
Anthony Taylor: the grammar dependencies for each word. Okay.

1218
01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:10.299
Anthony Taylor: I don't know what the hell. So the determinant route. Hey, mom, how is the subject?

1219
01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:15.679
Anthony Taylor: Jumped the root over as a preposition is 10, am I?

1220
01:53:16.200 --> 01:53:27.089
Anthony Taylor: Whenever they have, that isn't English. Okay, so here, we're gonna get this. Now, this is really cool. Why do you see this? We're going to grab the tokens

1221
01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:33.139
Anthony Taylor: and give a graphical output of how this sentence works

1222
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:37.499
Anthony Taylor: is that nuts. Look at that.

1223
01:53:37.790 --> 01:53:42.410
Anthony Taylor: Cal defines the A MoD. So brown is not for Cal.

1224
01:53:43.740 --> 01:53:46.770
Anthony Taylor: Now, subject proposition.

1225
01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:51.550
Anthony Taylor: These are so cool. I just, I love this. This is so.

1226
01:53:52.210 --> 01:54:07.800
Anthony Taylor: Does anybody else think this is me? Cause I think this is me much better in school as a kid if I had seen this graph. I agree. And I think the reason I get so excited about it is because it's like like one of the one topics that I don't do well with.

1227
01:54:07.980 --> 01:54:09.080
Anthony Taylor: But that's okay.

1228
01:54:09.270 --> 01:54:16.429
Anthony Taylor: There's actually you can actually change this, too. I don't know why they get so excited about this. Maybe they like as much as I did.

1229
01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:18.649
Anthony Taylor: You can make it a little different.

1230
01:54:18.780 --> 01:54:21.989
Anthony Taylor: Also, don't do this yet.

1231
01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:25.170
Anthony Taylor: Just know. You can also

1232
01:54:30.710 --> 01:54:31.920
Anthony Taylor: where to go.

1233
01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:34.780
Anthony Taylor: It goes to.

1234
01:54:37.580 --> 01:54:42.820
Anthony Taylor: It actually creates a website that you can copy that's got to find it

1235
01:54:44.930 --> 01:54:50.050
Anthony Taylor: serving on 50 50. So if you like, go to a browse, or

1236
01:54:51.570 --> 01:54:53.680
Anthony Taylor: that's weird. I usually have this 10,

1237
01:54:55.860 --> 01:55:00.770
Anthony Taylor: go to local host. I did not try this, so this may not.

1238
01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:03.690
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, there it goes.

1239
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:08.689
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And so you could technically like.

1240
01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:11.919
Anthony Taylor: grab the code for this.

1241
01:55:12.860 --> 01:55:14.979
Anthony Taylor: and you'd have it.

1242
01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:25.500
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. so you could like, grab this and put it on a website or something from my website. People like Gabe

1243
01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:30.570
Anthony Taylor: Akiyaki.

1244
01:55:31.810 --> 01:55:35.850
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Now to kill that, you have to actually interrupt.

1245
01:55:36.340 --> 01:55:40.060
Anthony Taylor: And then then you can get your mail, your your notebook back. Oh.

1246
01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:52.210
Anthony Taylor: if I would've went like another half inch, I would have saw it. Okay. alright. So what else can we do well, we can do for each token

1247
01:55:52.250 --> 01:55:59.900
Anthony Taylor: we can print like the whole thing right instead of so this kind of goes back to our chart. D is.

1248
01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:06.909
Anthony Taylor: whatever I've got with Dt is. But anyway, out goes back to the

1249
01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:10.369
Anthony Taylor: basically is the text version of this graphic

1250
01:56:12.780 --> 01:56:21.200
Anthony Taylor: we can retrieve the agent subscribe to word PAL, so we could say the head text, PAL, give me the ad.

1251
01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:22.879
Anthony Taylor: and I'll put it.

1252
01:56:22.940 --> 01:56:24.660
Anthony Taylor: and we get brown.

1253
01:56:25.690 --> 01:56:27.010
Anthony Taylor: Yes, I'm

1254
01:56:28.100 --> 01:56:33.999
Baro, Sonja: so in terms of doing our natural language processing

1255
01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:39.340
Baro, Sonja: is the reason we're learning this to know how the

1256
01:56:39.390 --> 01:56:46.780
Baro, Sonja: computer is understanding the sentence or like, did it have to get trained on this, or

1257
01:56:47.390 --> 01:56:54.149
Baro, Sonja: I'm just trying to. I I'm not getting. If I'm supposed to be getting the why behind this

1258
01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:05.029
Baro, Sonja: you don't need it. Go for it. Connie. you don't need. Okay.

1259
01:57:05.090 --> 01:57:14.079
Anthony Taylor: it's okay. So so no. So think of. So remember when we were doing pandas, we were doing data analytics, right.

1260
01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:16.989
Anthony Taylor: The the analytics itself

1261
01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:19.470
Anthony Taylor: helped us accomplish

1262
01:57:19.490 --> 01:57:23.080
Anthony Taylor: the goal at the end. This is the analytics part

1263
01:57:23.090 --> 01:57:25.009
Anthony Taylor: of natural language processing.

1264
01:57:25.900 --> 01:57:27.800
Baro, Sonja: Okay, I

1265
01:57:28.050 --> 01:57:33.370
Anthony Taylor: me personally, I've heard of Spacey. I've used Spacey. I've never used it for pos.

1266
01:57:33.970 --> 01:57:39.210
Anthony Taylor: So when I saw this, I was like, this is freaking cool. I was excited about it as Natalie.

1267
01:57:40.290 --> 01:57:42.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but

1268
01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:46.060
Anthony Taylor: I've never had a need to do this

1269
01:57:47.410 --> 01:57:50.409
Anthony Taylor: now that I know how I might do it for some

1270
01:57:51.050 --> 01:57:54.599
Raugewitz, Tania: that was, gonna be my question, what would, what could

1271
01:57:54.930 --> 01:57:56.799
Raugewitz, Tania: somebody use this for?

1272
01:57:57.760 --> 01:57:59.600
Anthony Taylor: Well, okay.

1273
01:58:00.630 --> 01:58:04.629
Anthony Taylor: let's do the next exercise. and then see if that answers your question

1274
01:58:04.690 --> 01:58:10.039
Anthony Taylor: and I will make this. This is the hard one. We'll make it. I guess everything's gonna be in everyone.

1275
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:13.600
Anthony Taylor: Guess that's just how it's. Gonna

1276
01:58:15.450 --> 01:58:19.719
Anthony Taylor: I know you guys are going to be so upset with me. You're going to write bad things.

1277
01:58:20.130 --> 01:58:26.579
Anthony Taylor: You're Gonna say, Anthony doesn't know anything because my instructor Knowledge Rock last week and I'll be dial. That's

1278
01:58:27.960 --> 01:58:30.910
Anthony Taylor: whatever. Okay?

1279
01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:34.299
Anthony Taylor: so

1280
01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:42.370
Anthony Taylor: we're going to grab from NLTK. The inaugural corpus.

1281
01:58:42.580 --> 01:58:45.530
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna load that same

1282
01:58:47.090 --> 01:58:49.840
Anthony Taylor:  spacey model.

1283
01:58:50.170 --> 01:58:51.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

1284
01:58:55.560 --> 01:58:56.320
Raugewitz, Tania: Hmm.

1285
01:58:58.610 --> 01:59:03.010
Anthony Taylor: so while that's running okay? So that's good. So

1286
01:59:03.090 --> 01:59:12.770
Anthony Taylor: just like every other time we've used the and Ltk stuff, we're going to take a look at what we have going to do. Inaugural dot file ids

1287
01:59:14.040 --> 01:59:16.909
Anthony Taylor: and see what we have in here.

1288
01:59:19.210 --> 01:59:23.880
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to retrieve the text for all of them.

1289
01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:28.710
Anthony Taylor: So just so, you know I don't. Don't have to read me for this one

1290
01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:35.350
Anthony Taylor:  But unless it's built in like what what Sonya said. Thanks for looking that up, Sonia. By the way.

1291
01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:39.700
Anthony Taylor: basically, this is every inaugural address

1292
01:59:40.380 --> 01:59:41.720
Anthony Taylor: pretty much ever

1293
01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:49.380
Anthony Taylor: so well, up to a certain year. I didn't see any of the more recent ones in there.

1294
01:59:50.590 --> 01:59:55.639
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we could take a look and see what we end up with. We have 59 of them.

1295
01:59:56.360 --> 01:59:59.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I can. I think that makes about right amount of sense. Yeah.

1296
02:00:00.730 --> 02:00:02.840
Anthony Taylor: let's look at number 10,

1297
02:00:03.710 --> 02:00:11.049
Anthony Taylor: Jackson, 1829. So so we're students about it. But

1298
02:00:11.480 --> 02:00:14.480
Anthony Taylor: that's what he sounded like. pretty sure.

1299
02:00:15.080 --> 02:00:17.480
Anthony Taylor:  okay.

1300
02:00:17.610 --> 02:00:18.590
Anthony Taylor: So

1301
02:00:19.170 --> 02:00:24.150
Anthony Taylor: use the most common adjectives. Function to tokenize. Text

1302
02:00:24.330 --> 02:00:32.470
Anthony Taylor: creates a list of with all of the adjectives and 3 most common adjectives and their frequencies

1303
02:00:35.270 --> 02:00:37.070
Anthony Taylor: is that it is that the whole function?

1304
02:00:41.170 --> 02:00:42.730
Anthony Taylor: Yep, that's the whole function.

1305
02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:46.609
Anthony Taylor: I'd actually look and make sure I wasn't insol

1306
02:00:46.910 --> 02:00:49.859
Anthony Taylor: alright. So now we're going to create a list.

1307
02:00:50.390 --> 02:00:52.050
Anthony Taylor: We're going to say common

1308
02:00:53.850 --> 02:00:57.400
Anthony Taylor: adjectives. not most common. Just come.

1309
02:01:00.900 --> 02:01:11.240
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna say, equals list comprehension. most common adjectives equals text.

1310
02:01:15.390 --> 02:01:20.989
Anthony Taylor: Oh, my God, I you know. And I did this, not the way I've been teaching you guys for text in.

1311
02:01:22.850 --> 02:01:39.610
Anthony Taylor: okay, so most common adjectives is a method of spacey alright. And so what it's going to do is look at the text in each of these inaugurals and and grab the most common adjectives and put them in a list. And then we're going to take a look at it. So let's take a look.

1312
02:01:42.450 --> 02:01:48.289
Anthony Taylor: It's reading 59 inaugural addresses. Right? Yeah. Aren't you glad you don't have to do that?

1313
02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:52.780
Anthony Taylor: I would be so boring?

1314
02:01:55.170 --> 02:01:58.750
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so look at what it did. So it not only did it do it.

1315
02:01:58.780 --> 02:02:03.150
Anthony Taylor: but it even put counts next to it. Isn't that great?

1316
02:02:06.370 --> 02:02:12.450
Anthony Taylor: It's interesting that that's in there twice. Yeah. Oh, it's in their lots. It must be by document.

1317
02:02:12.590 --> 02:02:17.320
Anthony Taylor: That's the only thing that makes sense, because great's in there a lot. I think we're gonna get into that. So don't worry.

1318
02:02:18.010 --> 02:02:24.519
Anthony Taylor:  okay, so here we're going to use conference review, each adjective and the number of occurrence

1319
02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:26.749
Anthony Taylor: in each text.

1320
02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:38.169
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So now we'll break it apart a little bit more. So we're gonna say, adjectives, equals and comprehension. We're gonna say.

1321
02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:48.520
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna use enumerate. Have we used enumerate before in here? I want to say we have. So member enumerate returns 2 things.

1322
02:02:48.890 --> 02:02:54.090
Anthony Taylor: We only need the first one. So we're just going to use the underscore to say, yeah, we don't need.

1323
02:02:54.340 --> 02:03:04.090
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So 4, I comma black n enumerate. Common edges. Okay?

1324
02:03:04.270 --> 02:03:07.190
Anthony Taylor: And what do we want out of that. I.

1325
02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:08.450
Anthony Taylor: We want

1326
02:03:08.530 --> 02:03:12.850
Anthony Taylor: common adjectives, square bracket I.

1327
02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:15.939
Anthony Taylor: And then the first one of that.

1328
02:03:17.770 --> 02:03:18.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1329
02:03:18.870 --> 02:03:27.330
Anthony Taylor: so that'll give us the adjective. And which or or for that specific I value.

1330
02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:30.670
Anthony Taylor: Then we're gonna do the frequency. Wow.

1331
02:03:32.790 --> 02:03:41.350
Anthony Taylor: I'm I'm so used to being able to tab and get the. And I'll get the the variable. And here we're gonna do this same exact thing

1332
02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:43.949
Anthony Taylor: except we're gonna get the second item.

1333
02:03:44.110 --> 02:03:45.949
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to do this again.

1334
02:03:48.820 --> 02:03:50.910
Anthony Taylor: And we're going to do this again.

1335
02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:54.600
Anthony Taylor: But we want the frequency this time.

1336
02:03:56.860 --> 02:04:00.750
Anthony Taylor: So look at what we're talking about. Public agitated

1337
02:04:00.850 --> 02:04:09.050
Anthony Taylor: frequency. 6 got it. We're gonna have 2 lists, one with the word, one with the count.

1338
02:04:09.420 --> 02:04:10.390
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1339
02:04:10.750 --> 02:04:16.459
Anthony Taylor: so we can run that. Got that. We're gonna save the year.

1340
02:04:17.070 --> 02:04:25.419
Anthony Taylor: Anthony, go ahead. Yeah, frequency shouldn't be one. You're right, thank you. II said it. I just didn't do it.

1341
02:04:26.940 --> 02:04:29.879
Anthony Taylor: There we go. Can I mess up anything else? Let's do it again.

1342
02:04:30.070 --> 02:04:32.699
Anthony Taylor: Thank you for correcting that. That would have been weird.

1343
02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:41.060
Anthony Taylor:  Now, if you look at this, save the year for the President as inaugural address in the following format, this is.

1344
02:04:41.740 --> 02:04:47.230
Anthony Taylor: if you notice the one we looked at it said, 1829, Jackson.

1345
02:04:47.420 --> 02:04:50.229
Anthony Taylor: that's the format that it comes with.

1346
02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:52.980
Anthony Taylor: We're going to change it

1347
02:04:54.290 --> 02:04:57.929
Anthony Taylor: to, are we changing it at all? We're just gonna get rid of the dot text.

1348
02:04:58.510 --> 02:05:01.709
Anthony Taylor: So okay, so we're going to do inaugural

1349
02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:11.480
Anthony Taylor: underscore address equals more list comprehension. we're going to say for id in ids.

1350
02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:18.600
Anthony Taylor: And then we're gonna take the Id and replace the dot text at the end.

1351
02:05:27.390 --> 02:05:30.400
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And

1352
02:05:31.860 --> 02:05:37.560
Anthony Taylor: okay. So now, we have a list of attributes, a list of frequencies and a list of

1353
02:05:37.640 --> 02:05:45.360
Anthony Taylor: the of the different inaugural addresses. Okay, so where you know where we're going with this, right, we're going to create a data frame.

1354
02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:48.880
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna do common adjectives.

1355
02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:53.890
Anthony Taylor: Df, equals. pd.in frame.

1356
02:05:55.290 --> 02:05:57.709
Anthony Taylor: Remember to make a dictionary this time.

1357
02:05:57.850 --> 02:06:01.929
Anthony Taylor: and in it's going to be the inaugural address would be

1358
02:06:02.770 --> 02:06:08.790
Anthony Taylor: the first column. and that will be the inaugural address, variable

1359
02:06:13.160 --> 02:06:16.550
Anthony Taylor: comma the second column will be additive.

1360
02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:26.149
Anthony Taylor: and that's the A Dj variable. Is that what we call it?

1361
02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:28.960
Anthony Taylor: A DJ. Yep, and the last one

1362
02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:30.970
Anthony Taylor: will be frequency.

1363
02:06:32.600 --> 02:06:34.379
Anthony Taylor: and that'll be frequency.

1364
02:06:37.590 --> 02:06:40.590
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. And then we're gonna sort it.

1365
02:06:41.380 --> 02:06:42.270
Anthony Taylor: So

1366
02:06:46.310 --> 02:06:49.270
Anthony Taylor: I see what they're doing. They're gonna make a new one here.

1367
02:06:49.810 --> 02:06:59.920
Anthony Taylor: Presidential adjectives was going to use the one we just made. That's sort values.

1368
02:07:01.400 --> 02:07:04.540
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna sort on frequency

1369
02:07:10.770 --> 02:07:12.519
Anthony Taylor: ascending is false

1370
02:07:15.070 --> 02:07:16.400
Anthony Taylor: and then drop

1371
02:07:16.570 --> 02:07:18.410
Anthony Taylor: the index.

1372
02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:31.350
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then we'll just display the top 10 rows.

1373
02:07:34.650 --> 02:07:41.750
Anthony Taylor: Alright, let's run it. See if we got everything. Nope. But did I miss named by

1374
02:07:43.730 --> 02:07:45.290
Gebrekristos, Haftom: plus sign on by.

1375
02:07:45.380 --> 02:07:48.210
Anthony Taylor: Oh, look at that!

1376
02:07:50.250 --> 02:07:51.160
Anthony Taylor: Here we go.

1377
02:07:52.180 --> 02:07:57.269
Anthony Taylor: So here we can see. Clinton used the word new 29 times.

1378
02:07:59.490 --> 02:08:05.289
Anthony Taylor: Okay, Harrison. Other 26 times. Monroe. Great 26 times

1379
02:08:06.550 --> 02:08:17.299
Anthony Taylor: pretty doggone Google, don't you think?  alright cool. They're giving us another cool function to use?

1380
02:08:20.080 --> 02:08:26.359
Anthony Taylor: So what is this one going to do, use the all adjectives, retrieve all adjectives in a given text, what'd the other one do

1381
02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:33.769
Anthony Taylor: use the most common? So this gave us the most common. Now we're going to get all of them.

1382
02:08:34.830 --> 02:08:37.740
Anthony Taylor: all of them.

1383
02:08:42.610 --> 02:08:45.120
Anthony Taylor: My new friend keeps telling me to stop seeing.

1384
02:08:46.290 --> 02:08:47.490
Anthony Taylor: I don't know why

1385
02:08:49.950 --> 02:08:51.279
Anthony Taylor: I do it so well.

1386
02:08:52.870 --> 02:08:59.310
Anthony Taylor: all addges equals all underscore adjectives. plus.

1387
02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:01.300
Anthony Taylor: I'll

1388
02:09:01.590 --> 02:09:04.670
Anthony Taylor: underscore a DJS.

1389
02:09:06.220 --> 02:09:20.780
Anthony Taylor: Text. Okay, so what do we do? So we got this loop. It's gonna go through all the text. and it's going to add whatever comes back from this into this list. And then we're going to output. And it looks like

1390
02:09:21.290 --> 02:09:32.409
Anthony Taylor: this will take a second trustee da da da da da. I know it's going through your head, and Tanya is right, but I'm not gonna say it until we get to the end.

1391
02:09:36.180 --> 02:09:41.560
Anthony Taylor: So what are they? Greater? Fourteenth, present, fondest, flattering.

1392
02:09:41.890 --> 02:09:44.829
Anthony Taylor: immutable, necessary, dear, frequent, gradual.

1393
02:09:49.300 --> 02:09:54.340
Anthony Taylor: I know you're like riveted. Buy this.

1394
02:09:54.390 --> 02:09:57.000
Anthony Taylor: So the most frequent

1395
02:09:59.090 --> 02:10:00.330
Anthony Taylor: adjectives

1396
02:10:02.800 --> 02:10:03.970
Anthony Taylor: equal

1397
02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:08.779
Anthony Taylor: counter. So here we're doing a counter. All adjectives

1398
02:10:09.970 --> 02:10:14.430
Anthony Taylor:  dot most common.

1399
02:10:14.610 --> 02:10:16.910
Anthony Taylor: Remember, that's the spacey function

1400
02:10:17.610 --> 02:10:20.359
Anthony Taylor: 3. So what's that? Let's read what this says.

1401
02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:27.400
Anthony Taylor: Most common functions from the counter modules so grab the 3 most frequent adjectives from each one

1402
02:10:28.730 --> 02:10:31.929
Anthony Taylor: are in total. great other and own.

1403
02:10:33.390 --> 02:10:35.400
Anthony Taylor: There you go. There you go

1404
02:10:37.790 --> 02:10:49.420
Anthony Taylor: alright. So here we're going to grab Tokenizer. We're going to use the getwords function, count occurrences of a word in the text. Get word counts. We're gonna tokenize it. We're gonna check it.

1405
02:10:49.650 --> 02:10:51.880
Anthony Taylor: We're going to return the count.

1406
02:10:52.870 --> 02:10:55.969
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so here we have another list comprehension.

1407
02:10:57.770 --> 02:11:02.549
Anthony Taylor:  really. Okay. So we're gonna look at those 3 words.

1408
02:11:04.010 --> 02:11:05.080
Anthony Taylor: great.

1409
02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:09.560
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then we're just gonna say, list, comprehension

1410
02:11:09.650 --> 02:11:20.990
Anthony Taylor: for text and text. So it's gonna loop through all of speeches. and we're gonna ask it. Get word counts the function. We just wrote

1411
02:11:21.620 --> 02:11:25.430
Anthony Taylor:  and we're going to say text comma

1412
02:11:26.220 --> 02:11:27.170
Anthony Taylor: great.

1413
02:11:29.340 --> 02:11:30.899
Anthony Taylor: I missed a quote.

1414
02:11:31.060 --> 02:11:35.679
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So let's just look at this one more time now that we have an example. So text and word.

1415
02:11:35.740 --> 02:11:39.809
Anthony Taylor: So it's going to say word tokenized. It's going to tokenize the entire

1416
02:11:41.150 --> 02:11:45.400
Anthony Taylor: text of the speech. Okay, then it's going to look.

1417
02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:49.470
Anthony Taylor: If that were for every word in there, it's going to lowercase it.

1418
02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:52.280
Anthony Taylor: And then it's just going to do a word. Count

1419
02:11:52.300 --> 02:11:56.279
Anthony Taylor: of those words, remember, tokenized is not in Cody.

1420
02:11:56.580 --> 02:11:59.250
Anthony Taylor: It's just the count thing that we did before.

1421
02:11:59.570 --> 02:12:07.390
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then that's going to give us our count. So wants us to do this for all 3 words. So just copy paste

1422
02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:09.520
Anthony Taylor: paste.

1423
02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:13.769
Anthony Taylor: and we're going to do own counts and other counts.

1424
02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:15.210
Anthony Taylor: So

1425
02:12:16.410 --> 02:12:17.530
Anthony Taylor: other

1426
02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:20.400
Anthony Taylor: other.

1427
02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:23.840
Anthony Taylor: Oh.

1428
02:12:25.620 --> 02:12:28.149
Anthony Taylor: oh, and we can run that now.

1429
02:12:30.130 --> 02:12:31.690
Anthony Taylor: and there we can see

1430
02:12:31.810 --> 02:12:40.010
Anthony Taylor: 3 0 5, 1, 1, 1 0 0, 1, 2, 1, 4, 4, 6, 5. Okay, that's kind of interesting. I think that's interesting.

1431
02:12:41.740 --> 02:12:53.589
Anthony Taylor: If you yeah, I mean? It is interesting. Alright. So let's create a quick list of dates. Right? So we have the date at the beginning of all of our file names, our ids.

1432
02:12:54.590 --> 02:13:00.789
Anthony Taylor: So let's do dates equals again, we're doing this. We're getting good at this comprehension, let me tell you.

1433
02:13:01.180 --> 02:13:11.940
Anthony Taylor: So. These are we're gonna go through all the ids. Remember, that was like 1829. Dash Jackson. Okay, we just want the date. So we're gonna say, id dot split.

1434
02:13:12.100 --> 02:13:14.509
Anthony Taylor: we're going to split on that dash

1435
02:13:17.620 --> 02:13:21.440
Anthony Taylor:  And

1436
02:13:22.860 --> 02:13:25.979
Anthony Taylor: we want the first value, which would be just the date.

1437
02:13:30.730 --> 02:13:36.000
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so that'll give us all the dates. See? If that works. Yep, that's beautiful thing.

1438
02:13:37.150 --> 02:13:38.160
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

1439
02:13:39.130 --> 02:13:45.080
Anthony Taylor: Hmm! Now we're gonna get the list. All the presidents really. So just grab this same thing right here.

1440
02:13:45.410 --> 02:13:46.700
Anthony Taylor: That's so silly.

1441
02:13:48.270 --> 02:13:50.630
Anthony Taylor: Change the variable presidents

1442
02:13:52.860 --> 02:13:54.809
Anthony Taylor: and change this to a one.

1443
02:13:57.110 --> 02:13:58.080
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1444
02:13:59.580 --> 02:14:01.410
Anthony Taylor: except for what did I, Miss

1445
02:14:04.210 --> 02:14:08.340
Anthony Taylor: Grant? Oh, I spelled Presidents wrong. That's kind of funny.

1446
02:14:11.090 --> 02:14:12.240
Anthony Taylor: And there we go.

1447
02:14:12.340 --> 02:14:14.180
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now.

1448
02:14:17.030 --> 02:14:20.299
Anthony Taylor: we could do a dot replace. If we want to get rid of that dot

1449
02:14:20.600 --> 02:14:24.470
Anthony Taylor: that dot text we could say, dot split

1450
02:14:24.570 --> 02:14:27.049
Anthony Taylor: and then tell it on the period.

1451
02:14:28.100 --> 02:14:31.940
Anthony Taylor: and then then we only want the one on the left, which is the 0.

1452
02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:35.760
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you do that, and you get just present.

1453
02:14:36.750 --> 02:14:41.580
Baro, Sonja: Anthony, can you stop and go back up to the dates? Of course.

1454
02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:47.520
Baro, Sonja: So mine pulled in both the date and the source.

1455
02:14:49.070 --> 02:14:51.160
Anthony Taylor: Did you do this

1456
02:14:51.630 --> 02:14:53.070
Baro, Sonja: I did.

1457
02:14:53.720 --> 02:14:56.250
Baro, Sonja: for id id id split.

1458
02:14:56.420 --> 02:14:57.320
Baro, Sonja: Hang on!

1459
02:14:59.790 --> 02:15:01.560
Baro, Sonja: I can't you have to?

1460
02:15:01.930 --> 02:15:05.430
Anthony Taylor: Oh, oh, oh, I thought you were good! I thought you were still sorry. Go ahead.

1461
02:15:05.590 --> 02:15:06.650
Baro, Sonja: There you go.

1462
02:15:12.500 --> 02:15:15.030
Baro, Sonja: So C, right here, dates

1463
02:15:15.230 --> 02:15:16.760
Baro, Sonja: id split.

1464
02:15:20.270 --> 02:15:23.779
Derek Rikke: Yeah, take those. You put your bracket out of the inside. Yeah.

1465
02:15:24.170 --> 02:15:33.570
Baro, Sonja: hey? Bracket.

1466
02:15:33.710 --> 02:15:36.729
Anthony Taylor: square bracket. 0 needs to be outside the parentheses.

1467
02:15:36.900 --> 02:15:39.130
Baro, Sonja: Oh, interesting. Okay.

1468
02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:47.770
Anthony Taylor: There you go.

1469
02:15:50.360 --> 02:15:55.409
Baro, Sonja: Perfect. Yeah, you'll do the. And then you'll do the present one the same way. Alright.

1470
02:15:55.510 --> 02:15:57.970
Anthony Taylor: Okay. back to

1471
02:15:59.680 --> 02:16:01.790
Anthony Taylor: okay.

1472
02:16:02.710 --> 02:16:14.069
Anthony Taylor: how much more is this? Jeez, okay, we're almost done alright. So we're gonna create a little data frame. I'm gonna put this one in slack. This is a lot of type.

1473
02:16:29.380 --> 02:16:37.899
Anthony Taylor: So now we have a data frame as year the President, and then how often great other. And oh, showed up in there

1474
02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:39.959
Anthony Taylor: stuff.

1475
02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:48.220
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then, last thing we're gonna do with this kind of fun. Actually, it looks like, just have to uncomment. That line.

1476
02:16:48.650 --> 02:16:52.919
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. hold on Df flat bar. Most common head.

1477
02:16:53.950 --> 02:16:55.769
Anthony Taylor: It's not called Df, though.

1478
02:16:59.160 --> 02:17:00.219
Anthony Taylor: Title

1479
02:17:00.820 --> 02:17:07.260
Anthony Taylor: big size. It's really close, actually. just uncomment that line and change it to

1480
02:17:08.379 --> 02:17:09.959
Anthony Taylor: Presidential.

1481
02:17:11.330 --> 02:17:14.879
Anthony Taylor: As it is, the F. Think that might do it. Let's see.

1482
02:17:16.510 --> 02:17:20.280
Anthony Taylor: Well, looky, there. that's just convenient.

1483
02:17:25.770 --> 02:17:30.030
Anthony Taylor: That's exciting right now. That was worth it.

1484
02:17:31.420 --> 02:17:32.440
Baro, Sonja: was it?

1485
02:17:34.389 --> 02:17:40.069
Baro, Sonja: I'm moving on. Hold on, we're almost done.

1486
02:17:40.719 --> 02:17:49.640
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So we have another function describe. So this function between the text that described the word America. Now, this is interesting.

1487
02:17:49.920 --> 02:17:53.049
Anthony Taylor: So this would actually be really hard to do

1488
02:17:53.389 --> 02:17:56.850
Anthony Taylor: manually right. You'd have to read them.

1489
02:17:56.930 --> 02:18:03.110
Anthony Taylor: Be smart enough to know that this is the descriptive word of the noun America.

1490
02:18:03.740 --> 02:18:15.509
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we're able to say, Hey, it's an adjective. And the head text is America. So this will return only adjectives that describe the word

1491
02:18:15.549 --> 02:18:16.690
Anthony Taylor: America.

1492
02:18:17.350 --> 02:18:26.010
Anthony Taylor: I think that's mildly interesting. So we're gonna do 4 text intact. So we're not gonna do this operation this time.

1493
02:18:26.540 --> 02:18:28.560
Anthony Taylor: Why, I mean, I figure

1494
02:18:28.780 --> 02:18:37.000
Anthony Taylor: you know, we've been showing it to them. We could keep showing it to them. America, I had it right? Actually

1495
02:18:37.969 --> 02:18:39.930
Anthony Taylor: okay, equals.

1496
02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:43.910
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna just do the America adjectives plus

1497
02:18:44.590 --> 02:18:47.170
the describe America text

1498
02:18:47.410 --> 02:18:49.450
Anthony Taylor: are passing in text

1499
02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:59.410
Anthony Taylor: alright. So we're gonna pass the text of the inauguration, no speech in the year. It's gonna find all of the adjectives that

1500
02:18:59.480 --> 02:19:03.889
Anthony Taylor: are for the word America. It's gonna put them in this list.

1501
02:19:04.059 --> 02:19:07.260
Anthony Taylor: And I did not run the function.

1502
02:19:07.590 --> 02:19:08.360
Wow!

1503
02:19:08.860 --> 02:19:10.000
Anthony Taylor: How

1504
02:19:22.629 --> 02:19:24.420
Baro, Sonja: let me guess it's great.

1505
02:19:24.620 --> 02:19:28.010
Anthony Taylor: productive, alert.

1506
02:19:28.049 --> 02:19:31.090
Anthony Taylor: illuminat! Illuminat!

1507
02:19:33.049 --> 02:19:35.470
michael mcpherson: That's not a word illumined

1508
02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:43.170
Anthony Taylor: Lumen, Michael Mcpherson decided. It was like stronger.

1509
02:19:43.570 --> 02:19:44.590
Anthony Taylor: rich.

1510
02:19:45.190 --> 02:19:46.160
Clayton Graves: So

1511
02:19:46.379 --> 02:19:58.490
Clayton Graves: how? Well, what's the what's the yearframe that this goes through? How? What's the most recent? Well, according to our chart, 1789 to 2,021.

1512
02:20:00.120 --> 02:20:01.670
Anthony Taylor: Is that 59,

1513
02:20:01.980 --> 02:20:10.469
Clayton Graves: 2,016? What would that one be? 2,017? I'd be curious to see what all the adjectives used. There were

1514
02:20:13.020 --> 02:20:14.710
me

1515
02:20:14.790 --> 02:20:25.020
Anthony Taylor: greatest thing I've ever done.

1516
02:20:25.130 --> 02:20:27.789
Anthony Taylor: Thank you. Everyone. Look at me.

1517
02:20:27.880 --> 02:20:32.010
michael mcpherson: anyway. Huge. YUG. Huge.

1518
02:20:32.280 --> 02:20:38.900
Anthony Taylor: Huge. It's huge success that I am. And I did it by myself.

1519
02:20:39.010 --> 02:20:43.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay, any questions about. So.

1520
02:20:43.900 --> 02:20:45.490
Anthony Taylor: yeah, that's that

1521
02:20:45.620 --> 02:20:48.459
Anthony Taylor: any questions about this. So

1522
02:20:49.160 --> 02:21:05.289
Anthony Taylor: what does this mean to an lp, again, it's an analytics. This is, how can we analyze, I mean, think about what we just did. We just went through every inaugural speech pretty much till 2,000 from the beginning to 2,021,

1523
02:21:06.050 --> 02:21:09.459
Anthony Taylor: and we're able to to pluck out

1524
02:21:09.700 --> 02:21:14.750
Anthony Taylor: specific adjectives that described a specific now

1525
02:21:15.530 --> 02:21:17.000
Anthony Taylor: or in this case. Prop.

1526
02:21:17.080 --> 02:21:20.219
Anthony Taylor: right. So that's pretty damn impressive.

1527
02:21:20.360 --> 02:21:25.820
Anthony Taylor: Would does it help us with this? Well, from an analytic standpoint? Yes. yes, Mike.

1528
02:21:28.370 --> 02:21:32.040
michael mcpherson: isn't that exactly how Gpt works?

1529
02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:39.360
michael mcpherson: It's taken all of the language, all of the words, put them together, so split them up by their parts, and then

1530
02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:41.960
michael mcpherson: read the context towards them.

1531
02:21:43.380 --> 02:21:44.480
michael mcpherson: But

1532
02:21:45.580 --> 02:21:52.220
Anthony Taylor: the bottom line is again, we're going to get into that more. But it's using a different method to do that.

1533
02:21:53.070 --> 02:21:57.370
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's doing a again. You know, I mentioned detention before.

1534
02:21:57.570 --> 02:22:00.920
Anthony Taylor: It's it's using. Tension.

1535
02:22:01.280 --> 02:22:03.519
Anthony Taylor: My screen is freaking out over here.

1536
02:22:03.820 --> 02:22:15.899
Anthony Taylor: Which looks at much more than just a few words, or just a couple of words. It literally looks before and after and creates a vector based on that. I don't know.

1537
02:22:17.040 --> 02:22:19.269
Anthony Taylor: I'm having serious issues over here.

1538
02:22:20.730 --> 02:22:22.590
Anthony Taylor: This is weird. Okay?

1539
02:22:24.700 --> 02:22:26.730
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Well, I'm gonna try to do this.

1540
02:22:27.180 --> 02:22:31.330
Anthony Taylor: But you're doing fine. You're doing fine. I mean that II

1541
02:22:31.890 --> 02:22:34.290
Anthony Taylor: we will get to that. Okay.

1542
02:22:34.780 --> 02:22:37.890
Anthony Taylor: alright. So

1543
02:22:38.330 --> 02:22:42.479
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna jump right into this last activity should be able to finish

1544
02:22:43.180 --> 02:22:47.450
Anthony Taylor:  bringing in the same stuff as before.

1545
02:22:47.520 --> 02:22:50.539
Anthony Taylor: Hey? We got a cool line. We're gonna say.

1546
02:22:50.750 --> 02:22:56.110
Anthony Taylor:  we're gonna do an N lp, on this Patrick, the homes thing.

1547
02:22:56.260 --> 02:22:58.990
Anthony Taylor: I know we have some Casey fans in here.

1548
02:22:59.690 --> 02:23:05.689
Anthony Taylor: and then we're going to access the tag data. So we're going to use intxt.

1549
02:23:10.770 --> 02:23:20.220
Anthony Taylor: I'm not sure where ant comes from. Oh, entities. Okay, got it.  plus.

1550
02:23:21.030 --> 02:23:34.429
Anthony Taylor: Put a quote. couple of dashes make a little arrow there, that's always fun and then do plus. It's dot label. And this is an underscore which typically will mean

1551
02:23:34.640 --> 02:23:36.200
Anthony Taylor: it's a property.

1552
02:23:38.570 --> 02:23:43.159
Anthony Taylor: Alright. And then we're going to loop through this and tape 40,

1553
02:23:44.170 --> 02:23:50.710
Anthony Taylor: I don't know what I was just thinking. I didn't realize we were doing this comprehension until we got to here. Dot, Dot.

1554
02:23:51.390 --> 02:23:53.470
Anthony Taylor: it's so.

1555
02:23:54.790 --> 02:24:00.540
Anthony Taylor: Doc, dot ends. We're going to loop through each one. We're going to hit the text and the label and output. It

1556
02:24:00.790 --> 02:24:03.489
Anthony Taylor: looks like that Mahomes person.

1557
02:24:03.950 --> 02:24:06.319
Anthony Taylor: Kansas City Chiefs organization.

1558
02:24:06.470 --> 02:24:10.360
Anthony Taylor: American Conference Organization 1, 2 cardinals.

1559
02:24:10.670 --> 02:24:12.830
Anthony Taylor: I don't think they mean redbirds, either.

1560
02:24:14.260 --> 02:24:18.639
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And the National Football League organization. That's actually kind of cool.

1561
02:24:20.720 --> 02:24:21.750
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1562
02:24:23.230 --> 02:24:24.239
Anthony Taylor: I like that.

1563
02:24:24.800 --> 02:24:27.090
Anthony Taylor: How long is this? Are we gonna make it.

1564
02:24:27.310 --> 02:24:33.000
Anthony Taylor: This is a pretty long one. It isn't everyone do. So everyone tried to get it. Okay.

1565
02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:39.369
Anthony Taylor: so here we're gonna look at the routers categories again. So we're gonna create a variable.

1566
02:24:39.800 --> 02:24:43.489
Anthony Taylor: And we're going to say Reuters.

1567
02:24:47.980 --> 02:24:52.069
Anthony Taylor: Oh, there he is! I thought I lost you for a minute that I was gonna be mad

1568
02:24:52.450 --> 02:25:05.469
Anthony Taylor: like I have to say it's special New York accent, just for Rodney. and then I can understand what you're saying. But before I did not know what you're speaking of, you understand, Reuters, hey? Some of them did.

1569
02:25:06.140 --> 02:25:11.689
Anthony Taylor: Some of them just required about it. Hang out with those Yankees.

1570
02:25:12.870 --> 02:25:16.450
Anthony Taylor: the Reuters, go to the Reuters?

1571
02:25:17.420 --> 02:25:22.819
Anthony Taylor:  And and you know what I think. I don't even try. Echo.

1572
02:25:23.190 --> 02:25:26.450
Anthony Taylor: How do you pronounce REUT. ERS.

1573
02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:34.670
Anthony Taylor: The pronunciation of Reuters is REUT. ERS.

1574
02:25:34.830 --> 02:25:37.220
Anthony Taylor: It is a

1575
02:25:37.490 --> 02:25:43.439
Mason, Natalie: she did say Reuters, but Rodney says it.

1576
02:25:43.780 --> 02:25:54.419
Mason, Natalie: II actually have a friend who works for them. Fancy accent like Rodney to say it correctly. Well, and my echo is an Australian, the the proper way?

1577
02:25:57.130 --> 02:25:59.770
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. You probably still say, Lou.

1578
02:26:00.790 --> 02:26:02.029
Anthony Taylor: yeah.

1579
02:26:02.210 --> 02:26:03.859
Masarirambi, Rodney: the right way. No way.

1580
02:26:03.960 --> 02:26:10.480
Anthony Taylor: That was just a lucky guess. Okay, so what are we doing? So here we go.

1581
02:26:11.180 --> 02:26:19.990
Anthony Taylor: The Reuters file, I guess where categories equals coffee. Okay? So categories

1582
02:26:20.370 --> 02:26:29.260
Anthony Taylor: equals Covid. and we want just one article

1583
02:26:30.400 --> 02:26:32.500
Anthony Taylor: good enough. Okay.

1584
02:26:35.030 --> 02:26:37.329
Anthony Taylor: he said. All I went here and we're gonna print you out.

1585
02:26:37.740 --> 02:26:40.890
Anthony Taylor: Oh, this is gonna take forever. There's so many things in this one.

1586
02:26:41.340 --> 02:26:47.550
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So there's our cool Columbia coffee registration main open. Yay.

1587
02:26:47.990 --> 02:26:51.390
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to analyze this particle with space need.

1588
02:26:52.820 --> 02:27:04.350
Anthony Taylor: there's like weird behavior on them. Okay, so we're going to use Nlp, so we're going to say, Doc equals n, lp, and then pass in our cool article.

1589
02:27:05.140 --> 02:27:06.290
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1590
02:27:06.430 --> 02:27:12.620
Anthony Taylor: then we're gonna this, actually enjoy this. I think this is another really cool thing

1591
02:27:14.810 --> 02:27:16.719
Anthony Taylor: that you could show your friends.

1592
02:27:21.140 --> 02:27:33.060
Anthony Taylor: There's probably somebody out there that that does a lot more in Lp than I do. That's like, what do you mean we do this every time. I'm not against that. Wait what I do. Bro.

1593
02:27:33.480 --> 02:27:36.000
Anthony Taylor: Function object has no render.

1594
02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:44.709
Anthony Taylor: Oh, this! What's did I call it displacing. Oh, that was the name of the library, this placey.

1595
02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:49.589
Anthony Taylor: There you go. So this is kind of cool.

1596
02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:52.720
Anthony Taylor: all right. It literally took the article.

1597
02:27:52.750 --> 02:27:54.970
Anthony Taylor: and it like highlighted

1598
02:27:56.650 --> 02:27:59.000
Anthony Taylor: components of I think you know how cool that is.

1599
02:28:02.980 --> 02:28:04.050
Anthony Taylor: It's kind of neat.

1600
02:28:05.340 --> 02:28:06.310
Anthony Taylor: right?

1601
02:28:08.890 --> 02:28:12.990
Mason, Natalie: We scroll up a few cells. I missed something.

1602
02:28:15.160 --> 02:28:23.980
Mason, Natalie: Keep going locate and store. Yeah, right there, right there. Oh, down a little bit.

1603
02:28:24.660 --> 02:28:26.079
Mason, Natalie: Here you go.

1604
02:28:26.260 --> 02:28:34.300
Mason, Natalie: Oh, oh, that! Oh, okay, we're just grabbing one article. That's it.

1605
02:28:35.500 --> 02:28:38.450
Mason, Natalie: Categories, coffee.

1606
02:28:39.930 --> 02:28:40.830
Mason, Natalie: Oh.

1607
02:28:42.360 --> 02:28:43.370
Mason, Natalie: wait!

1608
02:28:45.030 --> 02:28:47.769
Anthony Taylor: Are you keep looking at that? I'm gonna talk to Tom. Yes, time.

1609
02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:59.110
Raugewitz, Tania: So I could totally see this as a like an illegal review or some kind of document review, even in scientific literature. If you wanted to quickly scan for

1610
02:28:59.900 --> 02:29:00.820
Raugewitz, Tania: terms.

1611
02:29:01.720 --> 02:29:04.850
Anthony Taylor: I think that's a cool way to use it. And again.

1612
02:29:05.520 --> 02:29:15.329
Anthony Taylor: I mean, space is using natural language processing to actually do what it's doing. So this does fit. It is a very cool. Oh, are you? Good. Now, young lady?

1613
02:29:15.650 --> 02:29:24.829
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it is a very cool functionality. And yes, it's really good. It's it's actually doing some analysis that if I told you

1614
02:29:25.050 --> 02:29:30.000
Anthony Taylor: to go find all of the descriptive adjectives of a now, and

1615
02:29:30.940 --> 02:29:37.209
Anthony Taylor: you know 59 documents. I mean. you'd be like, forget that

1616
02:29:37.750 --> 02:29:42.170
Anthony Taylor: right. But now you have a way to do it in like 3 lines of code.

1617
02:29:43.540 --> 02:29:57.059
Anthony Taylor: That's kind of a cool thing to to have in your back pocket. If you know what I mean. Alright. So here, we're going to take articles we're gonna grab all of the coffee articles this time.

1618
02:29:58.140 --> 02:30:02.110
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna go

1619
02:30:02.340 --> 02:30:03.380
Anthony Taylor: equals cut.

1620
02:30:04.550 --> 02:30:05.320
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

1621
02:30:06.020 --> 02:30:11.420
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to do Nlp on all of

1622
02:30:17.480 --> 02:30:20.290
Anthony Taylor: yeah, we're gonna run that that might take a second

1623
02:30:22.910 --> 02:30:24.570
Anthony Taylor: while we're doing that.

1624
02:30:26.290 --> 02:30:32.059
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so here, we're going. So we saw what the labels did. Right? Labels gave us

1625
02:30:32.210 --> 02:30:38.340
Anthony Taylor: like, organization person, Cardinal, okay? So in this situation.

1626
02:30:38.470 --> 02:30:46.710
Anthony Taylor: we're going to say, Hey, extract the geopolitical and organizational entities using list comprehension.

1627
02:30:46.990 --> 02:30:55.180
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna take what we just did within Lp. and say, Geo org entities

1628
02:30:55.820 --> 02:31:03.059
Anthony Taylor: equals. And then we're gonna do a list comprehension. So we're gonna loop through. We're going to create a variable called end.

1629
02:31:03.110 --> 02:31:09.839
Anthony Taylor: It's going to represent each doc, dot e in t's. And then we're going to filter. If

1630
02:31:10.200 --> 02:31:12.290
Anthony Taylor: And

1631
02:31:12.540 --> 02:31:16.220
Anthony Taylor: dot label, as remember, up above. That was the label

1632
02:31:16.290 --> 02:31:17.809
Anthony Taylor: is in

1633
02:31:18.580 --> 02:31:21.889
Anthony Taylor: GPE. Or Orc. GPE

1634
02:31:23.270 --> 02:31:25.750
Anthony Taylor: comma or

1635
02:31:26.030 --> 02:31:34.419
Anthony Taylor: okay. So we have that, what do we want to do with it? We just want text to be added to this list. So we'll say, entxt

1636
02:31:34.540 --> 02:31:38.349
Anthony Taylor: for that. And then we're just gonna print out the first

1637
02:31:38.710 --> 02:31:42.200
Anthony Taylor: 40 of them or 20 of them.

1638
02:31:42.700 --> 02:31:46.370
Anthony Taylor:  wow.

1639
02:31:46.820 --> 02:31:48.940
Anthony Taylor: pow, okay.

1640
02:31:49.280 --> 02:31:50.150
Anthony Taylor: right there.

1641
02:31:51.680 --> 02:31:52.980
Anthony Taylor: And look at that

1642
02:31:53.990 --> 02:31:54.900
Anthony Taylor: we got.

1643
02:31:56.710 --> 02:31:59.059
Anthony Taylor: That is, guys that's really cool.

1644
02:32:00.170 --> 02:32:12.750
Anthony Taylor: I mean, that's kind of neat again. it is using n lp, to do this. So that's that's how I'm gonna go with. That's how I'm gonna fit this into this lesson. That's something extremely valuable.

1645
02:32:12.990 --> 02:32:19.789
Anthony Taylor: If anything, I'm gonna be honest with you. I'm gonna try to find ways to use this at work just because it's freaking cool.

1646
02:32:21.580 --> 02:32:25.559
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. So entities.

1647
02:32:25.840 --> 02:32:35.360
Anthony Taylor: Let's what is this one saying to do? This one says, convert the entity to lower case and remove the new line character. Oh, yeah, look, we have some lines in there.

1648
02:32:35.630 --> 02:32:40.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's easy enough. Right? So we're gonna do a list comprehension again.

1649
02:32:40.710 --> 02:32:46.640
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna say 4, I in. And this is, gonna be

1650
02:32:46.890 --> 02:32:50.140
Anthony Taylor: this list, we just how the heck I end up in here

1651
02:32:51.400 --> 02:32:55.350
that list we just made. So Geo org entities.

1652
02:32:55.460 --> 02:32:59.639
Anthony Taylor: we don't need to filter. but we're gonna take the

1653
02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:04.120
Anthony Taylor: the the entity if you will. We're gonna say, I dot lower

1654
02:33:05.420 --> 02:33:07.700
Anthony Taylor: and replace

1655
02:33:10.450 --> 02:33:12.500
Anthony Taylor: slash in

1656
02:33:13.510 --> 02:33:15.250
Anthony Taylor: comma do-oop.

1657
02:33:16.580 --> 02:33:19.490
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then we can print these out

1658
02:33:22.030 --> 02:33:28.080
Anthony Taylor: and run it much prettier love that

1659
02:33:30.190 --> 02:33:32.260
there's a lot of investment.

1660
02:33:32.840 --> 02:33:34.000
Anthony Taylor: Oh, my God.

1661
02:33:35.790 --> 02:33:36.560
Anthony Taylor: huh!

1662
02:33:42.780 --> 02:33:43.820
Anthony Taylor: 1 s!

1663
02:33:45.940 --> 02:33:49.919
Anthony Taylor: That is really interesting. I honest to God, my!

1664
02:33:49.980 --> 02:33:51.380
Anthony Taylor: My screen

1665
02:33:52.410 --> 02:34:01.079
Anthony Taylor: with all the stuff in it. That we're doing right now is completely like flickering so bad because of the

1666
02:34:03.250 --> 02:34:10.719
Anthony Taylor: the amount of words that are being returned. I guess so. Hold on 1 s, I'm grabbing it from somewhere else.

1667
02:34:18.720 --> 02:34:19.580
Anthony Taylor: Got it

1668
02:34:22.980 --> 02:34:25.559
Anthony Taylor: all right. So, continuing on.

1669
02:34:25.580 --> 02:34:26.940
Anthony Taylor: where are we right now?

1670
02:34:28.070 --> 02:34:32.479
Anthony Taylor: Create a variable with most frequents a M. This. But that's okay.

1671
02:34:36.700 --> 02:34:39.620
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So we have most

1672
02:34:40.610 --> 02:34:44.470
Anthony Taylor: frequent entities.

1673
02:34:44.560 --> 02:34:47.570
Anthony Taylor: And this time we're going to do our counter.

1674
02:34:48.700 --> 02:34:55.110
Anthony Taylor: And this is the entities we just made. So we're going to count the entities. And then we're going to get the most common ones.

1675
02:34:56.120 --> 02:34:59.399
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then we're gonna print the first 10 of those

1676
02:35:01.290 --> 02:35:11.849
Anthony Taylor:  And then we can see Brazil ico us lobby a lot. This makes sense. It's copy, right?

1677
02:35:14.240 --> 02:35:20.680
Anthony Taylor: Makes sense. This is all making sense now, except I don't understand why London is in there.

1678
02:35:25.290 --> 02:35:36.620
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we're gonna use list, comprehension to retrieve each entity and the number of occurrences for each entity into. So basically, what are we doing guys? We're working up to making

1679
02:35:36.640 --> 02:35:42.020
Anthony Taylor: a new data frame. So we're gonna say, we're gonna enumerate again. So we got to do this

1680
02:35:42.380 --> 02:35:46.169
Anthony Taylor: I underscore thing in enumerate.

1681
02:35:48.180 --> 02:35:53.539
Anthony Taylor: Most frequent entities. And then we're gonna say.

1682
02:35:56.280 --> 02:36:01.519
Anthony Taylor: most frequent entities. I what 0?

1683
02:36:03.930 --> 02:36:08.369
Anthony Taylor: So this is the same thing that we did where I messed up and didn't put the one in there.

1684
02:36:09.130 --> 02:36:12.400
Anthony Taylor: This one's gonna be frequency.

1685
02:36:13.920 --> 02:36:15.709
Anthony Taylor: And this is going to become a one.

1686
02:36:17.020 --> 02:36:18.589
Anthony Taylor: Okay run that

1687
02:36:18.610 --> 02:36:24.640
Anthony Taylor: got our list. Now, we're going to create our data frame. So I'm going to copy paste this in the slack.

1688
02:36:27.610 --> 02:36:37.809
Anthony Taylor: Oh, we're gonna be close guys. We're gonna be close. But actually considering we started the class with my little day in the life. Spiel, we're doing pretty good.

1689
02:36:42.350 --> 02:36:44.820
Anthony Taylor: Okay. we can run that.

1690
02:36:45.070 --> 02:36:48.369
Anthony Taylor: We can see all of them. Oh, look at that!

1691
02:36:49.470 --> 02:36:50.639
Anthony Taylor: Look at that!

1692
02:36:53.280 --> 02:37:01.270
Anthony Taylor: The the old display! The last 10 min I was like, what is it asking for. So we just how do we display the last key rows of data? Frame

1693
02:37:04.600 --> 02:37:05.400
michael mcpherson: hail?

1694
02:37:06.110 --> 02:37:10.810
Anthony Taylor: Thank you. I would have been so bummed if nobody got there.

1695
02:37:13.710 --> 02:37:19.099
Anthony Taylor: Dutch Coffee Roasters Association is only mentioned once

1696
02:37:24.270 --> 02:37:25.340
Anthony Taylor: questions.

1697
02:37:32.970 --> 02:37:36.719
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So again, I'm going to emphasize.

1698
02:37:37.010 --> 02:37:41.430
Anthony Taylor: I absolutely love today's list. I think they were very, very cool.

1699
02:37:41.820 --> 02:37:45.600
Anthony Taylor: It's interesting that we kind of went from pre-processing

1700
02:37:46.250 --> 02:37:57.499
Anthony Taylor: to analytics. And then I'm I'm I'm certainly hoping that next class we're going to get into naive bays, and all of that to do predictive

1701
02:37:57.610 --> 02:37:59.330
Anthony Taylor: or to do.

1702
02:38:00.060 --> 02:38:04.669
Anthony Taylor: You know, P, type of stuff doesn't matter, because I know where to more advanced stuff.

1703
02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:06.970
Anthony Taylor: And the next com in the coming weeks.

1704
02:38:07.130 --> 02:38:19.930
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, in the next less we'll continue to deepen our knowledge of text classification. Introduce some text generation techniques. using what we already know about deep learning models. That's pretty exciting.

1705
02:38:20.500 --> 02:38:21.340
Anthony Taylor: So

1706
02:38:21.460 --> 02:38:25.539
Anthony Taylor: think we learned some really cool Nlp stuff today.

1707
02:38:25.870 --> 02:38:32.779
Anthony Taylor:  I'm pretty excited about what we learned today. I think it's something that you guys can all keep in your tool belt.

1708
02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:36.519
Anthony Taylor: I mean, like, I said, just imagine trying to do that.

1709
02:38:37.160 --> 02:38:42.209
Anthony Taylor: I mean, you could do this with medical files. You could do this with legal files.

1710
02:38:43.980 --> 02:38:46.149
Anthony Taylor: I mean anything, really.

1711
02:38:46.510 --> 02:38:50.789
Anthony Taylor: And what you're going to see when we get to the Llm. Stuff. If they don't show you, I'll show you.

1712
02:38:50.840 --> 02:38:53.260
Anthony Taylor: you know you can. You can pull.

1713
02:38:54.010 --> 02:38:57.539
Anthony Taylor: I mean entire websites down into

1714
02:38:57.710 --> 02:39:13.100
Anthony Taylor: these models and then be able to identify stuff. And I will say this to go along kind of with what Mike was saying, yeah, Olympics, to do this pretty simply but keep in mind. Yellow limbs are built off of this technology. So they, this is like.

1715
02:39:13.220 --> 02:39:14.909
Anthony Taylor: this is like native today.

1716
02:39:15.550 --> 02:39:20.650
Anthony Taylor: Okay, how they got to where they are today. Well, that's a lot more advanced, but

1717
02:39:20.800 --> 02:39:21.880
Anthony Taylor: we'll get there

1718
02:39:22.410 --> 02:39:24.000
Anthony Taylor: alright. So

1719
02:39:24.860 --> 02:39:26.570
Anthony Taylor: there are no questions.

1720
02:39:27.390 --> 02:39:32.090
Anthony Taylor: We will begin office hours and tell you to have a wonderful weekend.

1721
02:39:34.920 --> 02:39:38.320
Anthony Taylor: Okay, have a wonderful weekend office. Hours have begun.
