1
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.080
Anthony Taylor: Officially.

2
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.109
Anthony Taylor: So he had a great sub, which

3
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.920
Anthony Taylor: I can tell you guys, that's awesome.

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.319
Anthony Taylor: I'm so glad you guys had a good stuff.

5
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:15.700
Anthony Taylor: It's

6
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.510
Anthony Taylor: not come.

7
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.930
Anthony Taylor: So I'm super pumped.

8
00:00:20.255 --> 00:00:25.099
Anthony Taylor: I watched some of the video. I saw some of you all given her some grief. I love that.

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.540
Anthony Taylor: No, all of you were just awesome.

10
00:00:29.034 --> 00:00:41.780
Anthony Taylor: She did have a wonderful compliment, she said, that this far into the camp to come across a class with so much energy and excitement about learning was amazing. That's not normally the case.

11
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.899
Anthony Taylor: And and I wouldn't know

12
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.260
Anthony Taylor: as

13
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.499
Anthony Taylor: yeah. My classes are always pumped and ready to go

14
00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.909
Anthony Taylor: because my classes that's not that I really want.

15
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.840
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So

16
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.390
Anthony Taylor: let's start with slideshow.

17
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.839
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So today is kind of a cool day.

18
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.080
Anthony Taylor: I mean? I mean, first off. Tell me, what did you all build yesterday? I didn't watch all video.

19
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.079
Anthony Taylor: So you guys built some apps

20
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.870
Anthony Taylor: on what was yesterday? Was it yesterday? Monday, Thursday?

21
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.489
Anthony Taylor: Christine says, no, we built nothing.

22
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.579
Anthony Taylor: Wait a minute. Didn't you guys make a translation.

23
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.500
Baro, Sonja: No, but we didn't build anything. We.

24
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.210
Anthony Taylor: Well, no, but you did a script, and it did like translation for you.

25
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.770
Baro, Sonja: Yeah.

26
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.190
Anthony Taylor: One that that did summarization for you and all that kind of stuff. Okay.

27
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.630
Baro, Sonja: Yes.

28
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.290
Anthony Taylor: That's when a packet.

29
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.110
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Well.

30
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:51.900
Anthony Taylor: for the first time, and the only time in this course, we're going to teach you a front end

31
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.829
Anthony Taylor: alright. So for those. Yes, Curry, I saw that.

32
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.019
Anthony Taylor: and it might be one you haven't seen before, Kurt.

33
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.179
Anthony Taylor: So for the most part.

34
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.770
Anthony Taylor: everything we've been doing is back, encoding back, encoding back, encoding. It's really not meant

35
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.530
Anthony Taylor: to be a ui.

36
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:18.939
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you're building stuff, really to create an Api, that other uis would connect to

37
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.750
Anthony Taylor: Radio.

38
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.990
Anthony Taylor: And it's funny honestly, until

39
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.290
Anthony Taylor: the Ll. M. And hugging face became super cool.

40
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.509
Anthony Taylor: I had never used it either, or

41
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.890
Anthony Taylor: of radio.

42
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:42.840
Anthony Taylor: I have used it since. Ll. M. Since this classes started, and I do find it to be remarkably simple.

43
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.460
Anthony Taylor: which is

44
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.470
Anthony Taylor: okay. It's a lot of fun

45
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.739
Anthony Taylor: really easy to use.

46
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.649
Anthony Taylor: and what I was trying to do in the background. There.

47
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.099
Anthony Taylor: let's see if it worked.

48
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.219
Anthony Taylor: was deploy a radio app

49
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.020
Anthony Taylor: to azure

50
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.290
Anthony Taylor: to make it an actual website.

51
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.290
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Now.

52
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.560
Anthony Taylor: I have found enough documentation

53
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.169
Anthony Taylor: that it should be possible.

54
00:03:19.102 --> 00:03:26.739
Anthony Taylor: And I'm kind of testing it while we're doing class here wishing it would work. I have a feeling it's going to be harder than what I found.

55
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.290
Anthony Taylor: But let's get going.

56
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.720
Anthony Taylor: So today we're going to become familiar with

57
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.230
Anthony Taylor: radio.

58
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.810
Anthony Taylor: hey?

59
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.210
Anthony Taylor: Radio.

60
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.520
Anthony Taylor: And it's different components. We're going to create a python app using

61
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.990
Anthony Taylor: radio.

62
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.610
Anthony Taylor: It failed again.

63
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.549
Anthony Taylor: we're going to

64
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.979
Anthony Taylor: interesting. Okay? Well, at least it failed for something different.

65
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:14.070
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and we're going to do an an lp, so we're basically going to do a lot of the apps that you and you guys will be able to take any of the apps that you did yesterday the backend

66
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.019
Anthony Taylor: and put them into a radio app and put them out on the

67
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.310
Anthony Taylor: okay. You can do this with just hugging phase.

68
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.410
Anthony Taylor: not a problem.

69
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.909
Anthony Taylor: Okay. I was hoping to like, give you another option outside of bugging face. But you don't need it.

70
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:37.099
Anthony Taylor: You can use this hugging fine, and you can embed hugging face radio apps into a regular web big.

71
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:49.049
Anthony Taylor: So with that being said, you could create a website embed the app that we're about to create into a web page on your website. And they wouldn't even know they were going to hugging face.

72
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.980
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

73
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.150
Anthony Taylor: pretty pretty

74
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.409
Anthony Taylor: awesome. And this is probably going to be a big deal for your

75
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.569
Anthony Taylor: projects, because I want you to have

76
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.010
Anthony Taylor: interactivity.

77
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.230
Anthony Taylor: Giving people stuff to click on makes them smile.

78
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.270
Anthony Taylor: making them smile will make them remember

79
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.720
Anthony Taylor: alright.

80
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.180
Anthony Taylor: Just well, any emotion you can make them cry. But typically that requires something more than a mouse.

81
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:22.900
Anthony Taylor: All right.

82
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.700
Anthony Taylor: Okay, unless you're really afraid of mice, and then you can maybe pull it up

83
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:43.650
Anthony Taylor: alright. So levels of extraction. And this is really kind of application talk. You know, we're not even coming close to trying to become application developers. But basically, you have data. You have a physical level, which is

84
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:59.820
Anthony Taylor: just, I mean, pretty much all of the backend, all of the hardware, the application code. Things like that. A logical level is between your your your user and the physical.

85
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.980
Anthony Taylor: That radio will basically fall into

86
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.170
Anthony Taylor: that

87
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:06.300
Anthony Taylor: category.

88
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.310
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

89
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.810
Anthony Taylor: I hold on 1Â s.

90
00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:20.989
Anthony Taylor: So we've created a few popular app to group in our demonstrations.

91
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.480
Anthony Taylor: And this last name.

92
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.399
Anthony Taylor: radio is a wrapper

93
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.590
Anthony Taylor: not like, not like, not like man not like.

94
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.880
Anthony Taylor: Are you a rapper, Natalie?

95
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:34.940
Anthony Taylor: No.

96
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.580
Mason, Natalie: Oh, absolutely not.

97
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.979
Anthony Taylor: Oh, okay, alright. I don't know why I thought you was a prep.

98
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.119
Anthony Taylor: I thought she was just like the coolest rapper ever, or something I don't like, I'm sure.

99
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.010
Mason, Natalie: Do it.

100
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.940
Anthony Taylor: Probably

101
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:56.029
Anthony Taylor: We've already been working on the low, level abstract. So we've already done

102
00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.649
Anthony Taylor: Api level stuff. Now, have you guys made an Api.

103
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:07.970
Anthony Taylor: You did long ago. But could you think about this? Could you make an Api with what you've learned so far?

104
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.530
Anthony Taylor: I Curry's nodding.

105
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:18.569
Anthony Taylor: You absolutely. Could I mean, remember, an Api is nothing more. You're going to jasonify the result and return it.

106
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:19.660
Anthony Taylor: That's it.

107
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.180
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I know it's been a long time. But truth be known.

108
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:24.470
Anthony Taylor: You

109
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.300
Anthony Taylor: pass in a question.

110
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.099
Anthony Taylor: you run your transformer. Answer the question.

111
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.330
Anthony Taylor: return back the result.

112
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.699
Anthony Taylor: Okay, Api. Done.

113
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:41.929
Anthony Taylor: Alright. You guys all have that skill already, whether you recall that or not. That's the thing.

114
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.310
Anthony Taylor: So Gradio is just going to give us our first

115
00:07:46.659 --> 00:07:47.579
Anthony Taylor: ability

116
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.090
Anthony Taylor: to

117
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.250
Anthony Taylor: create a visual interface

118
00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.740
Anthony Taylor: for people to look at.

119
00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.949
Anthony Taylor: And I'm going to put in slack

120
00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:01.840
Anthony Taylor: under live

121
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.530
Anthony Taylor: a link.

122
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.889
Anthony Taylor: So here's the documentation for radio.

123
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:25.379
Anthony Taylor: that's what we're gonna be doing. It does a lot. Guys, it really really does.

124
00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:26.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

125
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:33.340
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna stop right there. Alright. So let's take a look at what it looks like.

126
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.990
Anthony Taylor: alright. So

127
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:39.000
Anthony Taylor: first, you are going to need to. It's now alright, just real quick thing

128
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:45.280
Anthony Taylor: for the majority of the apps we're going to do in today's class. You do not need to go to Google Cola.

129
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:46.510
Anthony Taylor: But

130
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.460
Anthony Taylor: you can do this in Google Colet.

131
00:08:51.020 --> 00:09:02.010
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you do have to install radio every time. If you do it in Google Co lab, if you do it on your desktop laptop, you only need to install it once.

132
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.780
Anthony Taylor: So everybody run, pip, install. Go to radio.

133
00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.399
Anthony Taylor: If you're running locally, no matter what you should run it right now.

134
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:12.890
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Hey? Anthony.

135
00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:14.380
Anthony Taylor: Does take a minute. Yeah.

136
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.649
Meredith McCanse (she/her): While we're doing that. What's the significance of the exclamation point in front of the pip.

137
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:23.129
Anthony Taylor: It's supposed, back in the old days you had to do it

138
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.640
Anthony Taylor: to tell the notebook that you were running at terminal

139
00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:27.890
Anthony Taylor: thing.

140
00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.020
Anthony Taylor: I don't. I don't believe you need it anymore.

141
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.110
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I'm.

142
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:35.899
Anthony Taylor: There. There used to also be one with the percent sign. You might see that sometimes, too.

143
00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.640
Anthony Taylor: But again, don't think you need it anymore.

144
00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:39.939
Anthony Taylor: It's just habit.

145
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:54.080
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so you guys will be running that that's fine. Let's just start talking, walking and talking through this stuff. So we're not doing a model. Right now, we're just gonna do a very simple app.

146
00:09:55.510 --> 00:10:02.459
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we're going to create a function called Run message. And it's going to return a message.

147
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.619
Anthony Taylor: Now, in this case, whatever we pass in, that's what it's going to return

148
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.200
Anthony Taylor: this entire line

149
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.989
Anthony Taylor: returning this message. And then whatever you type in.

150
00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.610
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

151
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:23.309
Anthony Taylor: we're going to define an input. So what is this? This is basically, you're making an app. You just had like a button in a blank. They wouldn't know what to do.

152
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.360
Anthony Taylor: So you're gonna put in an input which is where they're gonna type.

153
00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:30.479
Anthony Taylor: And you're gonna say, what is the message you want to send.

154
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.850
Anthony Taylor: Thank you.

155
00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:35.800
Anthony Taylor: When they add the message.

156
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.940
Anthony Taylor: they're going to run message and print it out.

157
00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.950
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's what's gonna happen when all this stuff works. Okay.

158
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:47.130
Anthony Taylor: actually, we should be able to do that. So let's run this.

159
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.330
Anthony Taylor: What message?

160
00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.769
Anthony Taylor: I? I am, Bob.

161
00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.620
Anthony Taylor: Okay, what's it? Gonna do?

162
00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:57.830
Anthony Taylor: Returning the message, Hi, I am. So that's all. We're doing nothing. Fancy.

163
00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.260
Anthony Taylor: but notice. We tested it

164
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:05.939
Anthony Taylor: before we moved on to create the interface. We tested our back. Then.

165
00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:08.680
Anthony Taylor: Okay, remember that

166
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.099
Anthony Taylor: you need to do that alright. So now we're gonna start the front end.

167
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.230
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to import radio.

168
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.359
Anthony Taylor: We're going to. It's the same one. You don't actually have to do it again. But that's okay.

169
00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.789
Anthony Taylor: we're going to create an interface

170
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.280
Anthony Taylor: using radio.

171
00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:30.740
Anthony Taylor: And we're going to tell it to run.

172
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:35.059
Anthony Taylor: It's going to. We can tell it what inputs and outputs we want it to have.

173
00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:38.019
Anthony Taylor: And that's it. Look, all of this

174
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.630
Anthony Taylor: is going to create an entire application.

175
00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.090
Anthony Taylor: It's one line of code.

176
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:44.220
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to launch it.

177
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.410
Anthony Taylor: And there it is.

178
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.970
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And this is just look, you can click on this link, and you can go see it on a web page.

179
00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.599
Anthony Taylor: Anything you do in here.

180
00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.579
Anthony Taylor: You submit it, and it'll output it on the other side.

181
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:09.330
Anthony Taylor: So you can see why this will work for your chats or for your

182
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.919
Anthony Taylor: your other stuff. Right? You can

183
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:18.830
Anthony Taylor: create a function that calls your model. Your transformers. Does the action return some stuff?

184
00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:23.230
Anthony Taylor: This is the input to your transformer. This is the output.

185
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:25.450
Anthony Taylor: AI baby.

186
00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:28.020
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

187
00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:28.520
Meredith McCanse (she/her): It's just.

188
00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.589
Anthony Taylor: First 15Â min of class, and we spent 10 of those talk about.

189
00:12:35.635 --> 00:12:37.450
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Anthony is.

190
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:42.175
Meredith McCanse (she/her): is sorry. This is, I don't know how to word this question.

191
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:45.709
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Super cool. And you're right. It's so simple.

192
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:46.909
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Is this?

193
00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:51.180
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Is this AI also? Or is this just a.

194
00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.869
Anthony Taylor: No, this is your staff.

195
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.120
Meredith McCanse (she/her): We're gonna plug into the.

196
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:54.870
Anthony Taylor: It.

197
00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.719
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, it's an app. And they

198
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:07.640
Anthony Taylor: hugging face. I'm really sure either came up with this or it. It is definitely meant to be used on hugging face.

199
00:13:08.214 --> 00:13:11.230
Anthony Taylor: But like, I said, I mean, this is a web page.

200
00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:16.079
Anthony Taylor: So technically, this can be hosted. And this is what I was working on

201
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.210
Anthony Taylor: in azure in Aws.

202
00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.230
Anthony Taylor: any website host.

203
00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:23.969
Anthony Taylor: you should be able to host this on

204
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.279
Anthony Taylor: that can support python applications.

205
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:33.479
Anthony Taylor: Okay, the good news is is, it's really really easy

206
00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.770
Anthony Taylor: to get it up on huggy face, if that and and it's free.

207
00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.340
Anthony Taylor: Well, you'll have too many, too many hits stuff like that.

208
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:40.360
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

209
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.619
Anthony Taylor: though, you'll be able to do that if you guys choose to.

210
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.259
Anthony Taylor: And you probably should, for your projects.

211
00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:48.850
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

212
00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:56.050
Anthony Taylor: so we can do more. We don't have to just do that

213
00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:02.710
Anthony Taylor: right. We can say, run, message, same thing, create an instance. And this time.

214
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:07.080
Anthony Taylor: what's the difference? Oh, this time we're going to change it

215
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.710
Anthony Taylor: to make the share equal through. Now.

216
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.530
Anthony Taylor: a second.

217
00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.280
Anthony Taylor: So share equals true

218
00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:24.919
Anthony Taylor: will create a public. Yeah. URL,

219
00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.620
Anthony Taylor: okay, so we said, share equals false

220
00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:35.290
Anthony Taylor: here. Actually, we didn't put anything so they'd assume share equals false.

221
00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:36.580
Anthony Taylor: Here we're going to put

222
00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:39.250
Anthony Taylor: Gary equals, didn't it? Wait a minute?

223
00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:41.190
Anthony Taylor: Did I put it up.

224
00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.260
Anthony Taylor: My, my thing is going back. Okay. We didn't put anything

225
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.549
Anthony Taylor: here. We're going to say share equals 2. We're going to run it.

226
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:52.050
Anthony Taylor: And it's you're like, well, that's the same one. And yeah, it is

227
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.640
Anthony Taylor: But

228
00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.940
Anthony Taylor: wait, hold on 1Â s.

229
00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:03.499
Anthony Taylor: No, it's creating it right now. Give it a second.

230
00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:05.559
Anthony Taylor: There you go.

231
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.220
Anthony Taylor: and here's

232
00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.109
Anthony Taylor: oh, wait

233
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.009
Anthony Taylor: anybody else get that.

234
00:15:14.096 --> 00:15:16.850
Mason, Natalie: No, it's just acting like my code isn't working.

235
00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:24.430
Masarirambi, Rodney: Until you until you run it, you'll get the error, or at least I got the error until I ran it, and then once I ran. It was fine.

236
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:26.610
Baro, Sonja: 9 months.

237
00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:27.800
Anthony Taylor: We ran this.

238
00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.180
Anthony Taylor: no, hi!

239
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.320
Masarirambi, Rodney: Maybe I'm going to end.

240
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.410
Baro, Sonja: Ryan's good.

241
00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.839
Baro, Sonja: The share link expires in 72Â h.

242
00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:36.345
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

243
00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:37.870
Dipinto, Matt: Share, link.

244
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:46.810
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I got yikes. I got an error message that said operation did not complete successfully because the file contains a virus or potentially unwanted software.

245
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:52.220
Anthony Taylor: Are you running the same thing? I'm running.

246
00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:53.140
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yeah.

247
00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:54.780
Mason, Natalie: Mine's first.

248
00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:55.970
Anthony Taylor: Oh!

249
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:57.709
Meredith McCanse (she/her): It worked the first time.

250
00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:04.839
Anthony Taylor: I don't know about that. Alright, we'll come back to that. Let's try this next. Actually, you know what?

251
00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.889
Anthony Taylor: Stop your restart your kernel.

252
00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.780
Anthony Taylor: Well.

253
00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:13.409
Anthony Taylor: not everybody. I can do it. And just tell you

254
00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.760
Anthony Taylor: I want to restart it.

255
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.229
Anthony Taylor: import radio again.

256
00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:24.609
Anthony Taylor: and then go down and run that one and see if it worked.

257
00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.730
Anthony Taylor: because it might just be that we had.

258
00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.849
Anthony Taylor: We already had one running, and it was not liking that.

259
00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:35.769
Anthony Taylor: as I know, this worked earlier. Yeah, I got it again.

260
00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:42.950
Anthony Taylor: That's interesting.

261
00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.960
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Well, let's go to the next one, and I will look into that in a bit.

262
00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:54.130
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So here we got just a different function. So what we're trying to do is add some complexity

263
00:16:54.330 --> 00:17:00.710
Anthony Taylor: to our little cute app. Right? So we have this function. It takes a balance.

264
00:17:01.178 --> 00:17:04.370
Anthony Taylor: The Ap. R. And it takes the days.

265
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:11.869
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so here's the cool stuff. It's going to return a rounded value of interest earned, rounded to 2 places.

266
00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:14.590
Anthony Taylor: We're going to create an interface.

267
00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.539
Anthony Taylor: We're going to tell it what function to use.

268
00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:23.189
Anthony Taylor: And then we're gonna say, for this one. We have 3 number fields, and an output is a number

269
00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.339
Anthony Taylor: and then run it.

270
00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:29.799
Anthony Taylor: Now, I'm gonna put share equals true on here, too, and see

271
00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.329
Anthony Taylor: if we can get it to work on this.

272
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:43.069
Anthony Taylor: and I got it again.

273
00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:45.049
Anthony Taylor: I'm wondering.

274
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:50.689
Anthony Taylor: out of curiosity, did this one work for anybody.

275
00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:53.349
Anthony Taylor: I'm guessing it worked for one person.

276
00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:55.519
Masarirambi, Rodney: Work for me.

277
00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:56.520
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I have got it to my.

278
00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.579
Anthony Taylor: But for lots.

279
00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.080
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Well, maybe it's just me. Then.

280
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:01.779
Anthony Taylor: darn it.

281
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:02.390
Masarirambi, Rodney: Have you tried?

282
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:04.450
Anthony Taylor: I did run this earlier.

283
00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:08.739
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I mean, no, I didn't. Well, I restarted it yet.

284
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:11.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so 1, 3.

285
00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:15.550
Anthony Taylor: Well.

286
00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.310
Anthony Taylor: but the bottom line is is

287
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.060
Anthony Taylor: that's

288
00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.149
Anthony Taylor: link that they gave you is a public link.

289
00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:31.340
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And it is possible

290
00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:37.670
Anthony Taylor: to. If you look through the documentation, you will see that you can actually make that link last forever

291
00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.950
Anthony Taylor: and and be able to use it wherever you like.

292
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:48.009
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so this problem here did Eric, did anyone.

293
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.960
Anthony Taylor: did anyone get any of them to publish publicly.

294
00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:53.730
Raugewitz, Tania: I did. Okay.

295
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:58.970
Anthony Taylor: I'm sorry. Let me restate that. Did anyone not get at least one of these apps to publish

296
00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:00.579
Anthony Taylor: Matt. You didn't

297
00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:02.260
Anthony Taylor: Gabe Jeremy

298
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:03.980
Anthony Taylor: interesting.

299
00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.730
Anthony Taylor: That's kind of interesting.

300
00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:10.330
Anthony Taylor: I will look it up and see if maybe there's something up. But.

301
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:13.290
Clayton Graves: I did manage to get a public URL working.

302
00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:15.980
Anthony Taylor: That's good.

303
00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:18.320
Anthony Taylor: It is weird that it's

304
00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.860
Anthony Taylor: giving us so much Greek.

305
00:19:27.614 --> 00:19:30.609
Anthony Taylor: Anyway, I'm not. Gonna look at it while we're all sitting here staring at

306
00:19:31.102 --> 00:19:34.070
Anthony Taylor: let's see. I'll see if I can find it while we're doing that, too.

307
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:38.295
Anthony Taylor: So the good news is, it does happen it does work.

308
00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.520
Anthony Taylor: we'll figure out why y'all are having trouble.

309
00:19:42.155 --> 00:19:43.370
Anthony Taylor: For right now.

310
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:47.429
Anthony Taylor: you guys are going to go and create a pizza app.

311
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:53.769
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you have in the body. You have a large medium small pizza

312
00:19:53.890 --> 00:20:03.400
Anthony Taylor: set topping price to zeros. They're going to create a function, use a conditional to check each topping, adding a dollar 99 to each to the total price.

313
00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:08.769
Anthony Taylor: And then when you're done, you're gonna calculate the price plus a 7% sales tax.

314
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay for this.

315
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.309
Anthony Taylor: gonna give you 15Â min.

316
00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.220
Anthony Taylor: And then, while that's happening.

317
00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.820
michael mcpherson: Really know how he's actually making money.

318
00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.840
Anthony Taylor: I'm breeding cats.

319
00:20:28.284 --> 00:20:31.310
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So how are we doing?

320
00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:35.420
Anthony Taylor: Did we get that done? Anybody have problems with that?

321
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:37.500
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

322
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.280
Clayton Graves: We were trying.

323
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:38.700
Anthony Taylor: Hang on!

324
00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:39.690
Clayton Graves: Indentation.

325
00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:42.850
michael mcpherson: Christine saved the day. At the end of the day.

326
00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:47.349
Anthony Taylor: Well, it's not, but she's the one that said she didn't get it done.

327
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:54.330
michael mcpherson: No, no! But she figured out what what we, what, what what else forgot to do or didn't do.

328
00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:55.279
Anthony Taylor: Oh, nice!

329
00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.970
michael mcpherson: She. She's she's got the win from our team.

330
00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:01.570
Kanouff, Christine: Alright! He's being super generous. I'm pretty lost.

331
00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:04.000
Anthony Taylor: Well.

332
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:08.679
Anthony Taylor: okay, well, then, let's go through this. So radio just to import, we're good.

333
00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:11.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this function.

334
00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.300
Anthony Taylor: Sorry. Thank you.

335
00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:17.590
michael mcpherson: I won't.

336
00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.110
Anthony Taylor: So this function.

337
00:21:20.823 --> 00:21:22.679
Anthony Taylor: was nicely written up.

338
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.080
Anthony Taylor: to to do the large medium small.

339
00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:34.900
Anthony Taylor: So basically, we're just saying, Hey, if the size is larger, 1,999, if it's medium to 14, if it's smallest, 999, that's it.

340
00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.270
Anthony Taylor: Ken

341
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:41.940
Anthony Taylor: topping starts out at 0. If there's a topping, add 1 9,

342
00:21:42.555 --> 00:21:46.610
Anthony Taylor: basically. What we're looking for is how many they add.

343
00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:49.430
Anthony Taylor: And then it will add

344
00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.859
Anthony Taylor: the price to the total.

345
00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, this one actually only adds

346
00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:57.049
Anthony Taylor: one topping for each.

347
00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:00.459
Anthony Taylor: so you can't put like sausage, comma pepperoni.

348
00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:02.949
Anthony Taylor: I am.

349
00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:07.510
Anthony Taylor: So when it's all done, it adds the the size price.

350
00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:11.960
Anthony Taylor: the topping price. And then does a 7% tax calculate

351
00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:15.479
Anthony Taylor: puts that in there returns

352
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:17.480
Anthony Taylor: this message.

353
00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:21.140
Anthony Taylor: So that was the hard part

354
00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:25.029
Anthony Taylor: the radio part, we're gonna create an interface.

355
00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:27.750
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna use this function. We just made

356
00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.330
Anthony Taylor: it's gonna have 1, 2, 3, 4 text messages.

357
00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And an output of text.

358
00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:37.830
Anthony Taylor: I

359
00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:39.640
Anthony Taylor: I'm actually

360
00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:42.940
Anthony Taylor: really interested.

361
00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:47.249
Anthony Taylor: Oh, okay, I was like, Oh, by the way.

362
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:51.579
Anthony Taylor: I figured out what the problem is for those that are having trouble hosting publicly.

363
00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:57.229
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it builds A. And this, Meredith, you kind of include me in on this. I think.

364
00:22:57.938 --> 00:22:59.850
Anthony Taylor: It builds a proxy

365
00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:02.430
Anthony Taylor: to do this on your system.

366
00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:07.720
Anthony Taylor: which is often used by hackers to totally steal all your crap.

367
00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.049
Anthony Taylor: But that's not what's happening.

368
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:15.940
Anthony Taylor: said.

369
00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.719
Anthony Taylor: That's why, when mine was flagging you.

370
00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.560
Anthony Taylor: As this is not okay.

371
00:23:21.027 --> 00:23:25.489
Anthony Taylor: and I had to go and say it was, okay. So you probably have to do something similar.

372
00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:28.810
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So

373
00:23:29.135 --> 00:23:33.129
Anthony Taylor: so yeah, when you come in here. Now let me ask you a question.

374
00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:37.520
Anthony Taylor: How did it know the labels?

375
00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:44.510
Anthony Taylor: I mean Curry, Curry and and Gabe are probably like, wait a minute. We didn't put any label text in there.

376
00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:49.360
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Got stuck on that, too. It's up in the definition of the function at the top.

377
00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:50.930
Anthony Taylor: Is it.

378
00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:53.899
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yeah, if it's right there.

379
00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:54.750
Anthony Taylor: Here.

380
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:56.949
Anthony Taylor: No, that's just the arguments.

381
00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:01.510
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Right, but those are the same labels that come up at the end when you run it.

382
00:24:05.095 --> 00:24:05.650
Anthony Taylor: True.

383
00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:06.590
michael mcpherson: Marvelous.

384
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:08.840
Anthony Taylor: So is that what we decided is the answer.

385
00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:14.129
Clayton Graves: Hold on, let me. Is there a return, you know. Let me see your return

386
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:15.760
Clayton Graves: now.

387
00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:20.910
Clayton Graves: So yeah, yeah, I gotta agree with Meredith. That's where it's gotta be coming from.

388
00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:22.429
michael mcpherson: So, yeah, thank you.

389
00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:24.410
Anthony Taylor: Sounds legit.

390
00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:26.270
Anthony Taylor: I don't have a problem with that.

391
00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:28.300
Anthony Taylor: I wonder.

392
00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.440
Anthony Taylor: Well.

393
00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:35.340
Anthony Taylor: what I wanted to think it was gonna do. But it didn't.

394
00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:40.049
Anthony Taylor: I assume it's the variables.

395
00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:45.449
Anthony Taylor: Now, it just happens that the arguments

396
00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:50.279
Anthony Taylor: are also the variables in this particular case, so

397
00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:51.449
Anthony Taylor: hard to tell.

398
00:24:53.630 --> 00:25:00.449
Meredith McCanse (she/her): If you change it, though, and put Bob as instead of size in the parentheses up top, it changes it in the output.

399
00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.979
Anthony Taylor: But you'd have to pass Bob

400
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.769
Anthony Taylor: into here. So it also changes the barrier.

401
00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:08.700
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I didn't have to.

402
00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.250
Anthony Taylor: So, but I'm I'm

403
00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:15.150
Anthony Taylor: and it still worked.

404
00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:15.920
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yeah.

405
00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.569
Meredith McCanse (she/her): The only thing I changed was the size up.

406
00:25:18.955 --> 00:25:19.340
Anthony Taylor: Possible.

407
00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:20.570
Anthony Taylor: I don't.

408
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:26.710
Anthony Taylor: You can't. I mean, I could see why it would change to Bob. But if you change this to Bob, your functions broken.

409
00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:32.439
Meredith McCanse (she/her): It worked. Just.

410
00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.130
Anthony Taylor: It didn't.

411
00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:35.190
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay.

412
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:39.420
Anthony Taylor: It didn't fail. There's a difference between not failing and and work.

413
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:43.069
Anthony Taylor: It didn't fail. Because, look, you can see very clearly you no longer have.

414
00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.399
Anthony Taylor: Well, so I think.

415
00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:49.950
Raugewitz, Tania: I I I think the argument is that it changed the variable name on the on the user interface.

416
00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:50.310
Anthony Taylor: Right.

417
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:52.999
Raugewitz, Tania: The function work. That's what we're saying.

418
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:53.680
Anthony Taylor: Got that.

419
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:59.409
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I I I was good. With that. I didn't need that clarification. I was simply saying

420
00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.610
Anthony Taylor: that your functions no longer work.

421
00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:04.429
Anthony Taylor: That's up.

422
00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.829
Raugewitz, Tania: I don't think that was being.

423
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:06.560
Anthony Taylor: So, okay.

424
00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.090
Anthony Taylor: thank you.

425
00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.439
Anthony Taylor: Okay, let's move on.

426
00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.070
Anthony Taylor: so

427
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:21.110
Anthony Taylor: let's make this a little more complicated.

428
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.240
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

429
00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:30.109
Anthony Taylor: So this time we're gonna add transform. So again, if you're in Google co-ap, you're gonna need to add transform.

430
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:38.160
Anthony Taylor: If you're not, you probably already have them installed from yesterday. Did you guys do anything local yesterday or everything? Was Google lip.

431
00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:40.449
Masarirambi, Rodney: Leb.

432
00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:41.690
Anthony Taylor: Sorry. Thursday.

433
00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:43.210
Masarirambi, Rodney: So lab.

434
00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:51.070
Anthony Taylor: Colette. So it's up to you. You can decide. Transformers aren't too bad locally. So you should be okay.

435
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.230
Anthony Taylor: If not, we can flip over there. I don't.

436
00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.700
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So

437
00:26:58.290 --> 00:26:59.560
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna run this.

438
00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:02.700
Anthony Taylor: And

439
00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:07.300
Anthony Taylor: we're just going to create a pipeline. So this will be the summarizer pipeline.

440
00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:15.719
Anthony Taylor: I believe it should be the same one you did from yesterday, our Thursday. If not, it should be very similar to one of the ones you did on Thursday.

441
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:17.370
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

442
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:22.080
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to go ahead and bring this in. It's got to do this whole load thing.

443
00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:29.190
Anthony Taylor: And when it's all done, we're going to create a function. So we have our pipeline.

444
00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:33.259
Anthony Taylor: And we're going to have our function. That's going to call the pipeline

445
00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:34.670
Anthony Taylor: passing in

446
00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:37.859
Anthony Taylor: in this case an article or anything.

447
00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.340
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

448
00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:45.550
Anthony Taylor: And and and

449
00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:48.620
Anthony Taylor: yeah, so it's going to pass in an article.

450
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:51.919
Anthony Taylor: And that article Will

451
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:54.670
Anthony Taylor: returned from our pipeline.

452
00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:56.615
Anthony Taylor: The

453
00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:00.400
Anthony Taylor: the value of the sum summary value.

454
00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:01.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

455
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:07.019
Anthony Taylor: perfect. This is the article we're going to use.

456
00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:08.360
Anthony Taylor: So

457
00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:10.599
Anthony Taylor: this you guys did

458
00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.379
Anthony Taylor: yesterday on Thursday.

459
00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.530
Anthony Taylor: Everybody agree.

460
00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.750
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

461
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:19.739
Anthony Taylor: here is all you have to do to make this into an app.

462
00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:23.470
Anthony Taylor: create an interface.

463
00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:25.809
Anthony Taylor: tell it what function to call

464
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.609
Anthony Taylor: the inputs

465
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:29.210
Anthony Taylor: outputs

466
00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:30.369
Anthony Taylor: and an apple.

467
00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:36.410
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And again, and and just just so we're clear. I absolutely agree

468
00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.190
Anthony Taylor: that this variable

469
00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:41.169
Anthony Taylor: as an argument, will become the name of the label.

470
00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:43.859
Anthony Taylor: 100% agree with that.

471
00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:44.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

472
00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.060
Anthony Taylor: all right.

473
00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.680
Anthony Taylor: So we've run that

474
00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:53.079
Anthony Taylor: we got to run all of the steps, not just one of them.

475
00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:55.370
Anthony Taylor: We run this.

476
00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:59.339
Anthony Taylor: And then here we go. So what it wants us to do

477
00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.169
Anthony Taylor: is copy this

478
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:02.690
Anthony Taylor: article.

479
00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:09.790
Anthony Taylor: put it in here

480
00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.499
Anthony Taylor: and run it.

481
00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:15.190
Anthony Taylor: and then it will do its thing.

482
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:18.360
Anthony Taylor: and there you go.

483
00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:21.580
Anthony Taylor: You've just made a summarization app

484
00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:28.250
Anthony Taylor: so you could do this with any of the pipelines you made yesterday

485
00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:32.389
Anthony Taylor: Thursday. I know I keep saying yesterday in my mind it was just

486
00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:36.309
Anthony Taylor: any of those pipelines you could do this with.

487
00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.300
Anthony Taylor: yeah.

488
00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:47.050
Anthony Taylor: Oh, oh, I was gonna show you guys this

489
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:49.230
Anthony Taylor: just for giggles.

490
00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:52.949
Anthony Taylor: So if you want, you can go to the documentation

491
00:29:53.423 --> 00:29:57.649
Anthony Taylor: and they have like a lot of I'm not like some of you're probably like, why do you make a drop for that?

492
00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.449
Anthony Taylor: I make radio button.

493
00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:02.020
Anthony Taylor: How do you make all these other things? Well.

494
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:04.860
Anthony Taylor: the documentation in this is really good.

495
00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:07.690
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So you could see.

496
00:30:08.221 --> 00:30:10.690
Anthony Taylor: This one's gonna actually build 2.

497
00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.919
Anthony Taylor: Fact, I'm gonna split it right there.

498
00:30:14.775 --> 00:30:17.300
Anthony Taylor: Don't really care about that one that much

499
00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.320
Anthony Taylor: much more interested.

500
00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:20.460
Anthony Taylor: And this

501
00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.620
Anthony Taylor: so you can see we have a slider.

502
00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.110
Anthony Taylor: We have a dropdown for.

503
00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.659
Anthony Taylor: Oh, I do have to run it.

504
00:30:30.113 --> 00:30:30.799
Anthony Taylor: Run this!

505
00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.899
Anthony Taylor: So we have a slider.

506
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:36.909
Anthony Taylor: We have a dropdown with a list that we can select.

507
00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:40.379
Anthony Taylor: We have radio, but well, these aren't radio. These are check boxes.

508
00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:42.120
Anthony Taylor: a radio button.

509
00:30:43.303 --> 00:30:45.780
Anthony Taylor: We can add things to this list

510
00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.359
Anthony Taylor: or take them off

511
00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:49.480
Anthony Taylor: pretty cool.

512
00:30:50.673 --> 00:30:52.169
Anthony Taylor: Did you do it in the morning?

513
00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:58.739
Anthony Taylor: So a single check box and you could submit it, and then it takes all of those variables

514
00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:01.830
Anthony Taylor: and shoves them into

515
00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:03.520
Anthony Taylor: the outputs

516
00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:05.420
Anthony Taylor: and your goal.

517
00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:08.300
Anthony Taylor: See all of her

518
00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.019
Anthony Taylor: quality. Blah blah! Blah, blah blah.

519
00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:11.250
Anthony Taylor: alright.

520
00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:17.040
Anthony Taylor: So that's a very cool thing. And notice they're using dock join for like the list of stuff.

521
00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:20.829
Anthony Taylor: But this just this little simple example.

522
00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:25.619
Anthony Taylor: I mean, it gives you Slider dropdown, checkbox group

523
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:27.060
Anthony Taylor: radio

524
00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.449
Anthony Taylor: drop down again with multi-select

525
00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:31.430
Anthony Taylor: Chatbots.

526
00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:34.670
Anthony Taylor: Okay, yeah. Mike.

527
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:39.069
michael mcpherson: Where is that you're looking at.

528
00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:43.639
Anthony Taylor: I made this just just look grabbing it off of the

529
00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:46.470
Anthony Taylor: documentation for you. Hold on. Let me

530
00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:49.209
Anthony Taylor: see if I can find it again.

531
00:31:50.533 --> 00:31:54.889
Anthony Taylor: Basically on the website I sent you in slack.

532
00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:56.860
Anthony Taylor: Here, let's go there real quick.

533
00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So if you like, come down here to components.

534
00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:11.099
Anthony Taylor: pick pretty much any of them.

535
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.440
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you can see like what it takes.

536
00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.819
Anthony Taylor: I'm trying to find the one.

537
00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:21.650
Anthony Taylor: There you go. So if you go to demo.

538
00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:25.970
Anthony Taylor: They have a couple of different Demos. They have the sense builder.

539
00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:30.039
Anthony Taylor: They have a hello world, one with some other features in it

540
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:32.380
Anthony Taylor: have multiple outputs.

541
00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:36.780
Anthony Taylor: They do have just

542
00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:45.619
Anthony Taylor: I I I almost don't even want to practice. But there is a label argument, though you can change the variable name.

543
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:52.930
Anthony Taylor: Okay, from the argument in the function. So you can change it in the graphic itself.

544
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.449
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so you can do that

545
00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:58.340
Anthony Taylor: if you so choose.

546
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:03.950
Anthony Taylor: I would assume that label is available for every type

547
00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:05.630
Anthony Taylor: of item.

548
00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:08.829
Anthony Taylor: pretty cool, though

549
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:11.590
Anthony Taylor: pretty cool.

550
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:16.339
Anthony Taylor: So yeah, that's where you can get that I'm looking into.

551
00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:19.300
Anthony Taylor: because I don't know that we're going to show you how to host it

552
00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:22.620
Anthony Taylor: on hugging face. I'm working on that for you guys.

553
00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:26.039
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But basically what I've got so far.

554
00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:27.779
Anthony Taylor: it's just to get.

555
00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:30.500
Anthony Taylor: That's it.

556
00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:40.990
Anthony Taylor: It's a it's, it's hugging faces a repo. So you're going to clone the your your space into onto your computer, put your app in it.

557
00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:45.409
Anthony Taylor: Commit it and push it up to hugging face.

558
00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.260
Anthony Taylor: and it's done

559
00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:52.619
Anthony Taylor: pretty cool. I hopefully, we'll have that before the end of today.

560
00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:55.300
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

561
00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:01.699
Anthony Taylor: So there you go. So we're back on you did text summarization.

562
00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:03.810
Anthony Taylor: You guys have another active.

563
00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:09.959
Anthony Taylor: I love. How fast these are. This is like the old days. So you're gonna use the summarize function.

564
00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:10.949
Baro, Sonja: Anthony.

565
00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:11.929
Anthony Taylor: Yes, some.

566
00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:16.049
Baro, Sonja: My output is like gibberish.

567
00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:18.330
Anthony Taylor: In which one.

568
00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.190
Baro, Sonja: The one we just did in the text summarization.

569
00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:23.279
Anthony Taylor: Text summarization, show.

570
00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:24.579
Clayton Graves: I'm too.

571
00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:26.539
Baro, Sonja: Yeah. Hang on.

572
00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:27.460
Anthony Taylor: Still Wes.

573
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:31.959
Baro, Sonja: I will. I'm like I moved you here onto different space.

574
00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.650
Masarirambi, Rodney: Oh, sure, it was just me

575
00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:35.340
Masarirambi, Rodney: that's like it's just me.

576
00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:37.150
Anthony Taylor: Rodney.

577
00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:40.639
Baro, Sonja: You guys come on.

578
00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:41.959
Baro, Sonja: Alright!

579
00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.779
Anthony Taylor: That is tipperish.

580
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:47.879
Baro, Sonja: Let me move your beautiful faces.

581
00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:50.110
Baro, Sonja: Yeah.

582
00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:51.880
Anthony Taylor: Scroll. Scroll up a little bit

583
00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:59.480
Anthony Taylor: part of a broader family, some weights of pie, George.

584
00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:00.630
Anthony Taylor: So

585
00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:05.529
Anthony Taylor: put make a new cell and put that article

586
00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:06.490
Anthony Taylor: arc

587
00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:10.510
Anthony Taylor: paste this text into a variable called

588
00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:12.229
Anthony Taylor: Whatever pop, whatever you want.

589
00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.760
Anthony Taylor: just something equals.

590
00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.249
Anthony Taylor: and then quotes.

591
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:19.450
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, what is that?

592
00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:29.560
Anthony Taylor: Is that the article.

593
00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:30.550
Baro, Sonja: Yep.

594
00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:34.329
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Alright, I'm good with that.

595
00:35:34.968 --> 00:35:38.469
Baro, Sonja: Why did it do this, though, like I don't know why.

596
00:35:38.699 --> 00:35:43.059
Anthony Taylor: Let's let's go ahead and keep going. Let's see what happens if you put quotes around the whole thing.

597
00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:46.419
Anthony Taylor: Did you put quotes on the bottom, too?

598
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:47.570
Baro, Sonja: Yeah.

599
00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:48.590
Anthony Taylor: How?

600
00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:51.599
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we'll try putting it in.

601
00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:55.569
Dipinto, Matt: Entry so triple, quote that thing to overcome that.

602
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.209
Anthony Taylor: Yup. 1, 2!

603
00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:59.529
Anthony Taylor: There you go! Go to the top.

604
00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:05.790
Baro, Sonja: Okay.

605
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:07.870
Anthony Taylor: Good. Now save that

606
00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:09.270
Anthony Taylor: and run it.

607
00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:12.280
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now make a new cell.

608
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:15.560
Anthony Taylor: No, you can make another sell up above like where you work.

609
00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:17.259
Anthony Taylor: So you can see.

610
00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:20.540
Anthony Taylor: And then and you're gonna basically run summarize.

611
00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:22.860
Anthony Taylor: And then Bob is all you're gonna type

612
00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:26.519
Anthony Taylor: and parentheses. Sorry in parentheses.

613
00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.590
Anthony Taylor: They're calling your summarize button.

614
00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:39.689
Anthony Taylor: There you go!

615
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:43.539
Baro, Sonja: Matter that I did it above the other one

616
00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:44.680
Baro, Sonja: shouldn't.

617
00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:45.560
Anthony Taylor: No, it's fine.

618
00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:48.029
Anthony Taylor: not well, yeah. When you run it this time

619
00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.070
Anthony Taylor: we run it later.

620
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:54.769
Baro, Sonja: Saying, Bob, isn't. I did run it, though.

621
00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:56.080
Baro, Sonja: No, you didn't.

622
00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.929
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, you did good. Don't worry about it.

623
00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:26.119
Baro, Sonja: This is when we need Natalie to sing for us.

624
00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.560
Anthony Taylor: You know what? Yeah.

625
00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:32.210
Anthony Taylor: those that has somebody who have this fail. They'll do this in Colip.

626
00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:40.059
Anthony Taylor: You don't need to. I would I? You can let your spread, though that is taking really long time.

627
00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:40.700
Clayton Graves: My.

628
00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:44.000
Baro, Sonja: Yeah, normally, it goes faster. Yeah.

629
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:48.989
Clayton Graves: Mine looks like it was written by a counter like a member of Congress.

630
00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:54.570
Clayton Graves: Chassis deny, deny, deny horns, deny, deny all, deny, deny

631
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:55.800
Clayton Graves: problems, denying.

632
00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:56.560
Anthony Taylor: But but

633
00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:01.019
Anthony Taylor: did. Was anybody try and pull that anybody trying to pull that that it failed up?

634
00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:02.390
Anthony Taylor: Go for it there!

635
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:04.050
Anthony Taylor: Did it work for anybody.

636
00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:07.220
Anthony Taylor: I did, okay.

637
00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:08.429
michael mcpherson: Works for me.

638
00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:12.039
michael mcpherson: Try flipping that block underneath, Bob.

639
00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:14.469
michael mcpherson: Well, that would just.

640
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:20.479
Baro, Sonja: I came back, but now it's weird. No, but now it's Lilith Lilith! Lilith! Hang on! This is funny.

641
00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:24.589
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, go to Cola. Let's see, Derek, student colab, let's see.

642
00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:29.950
Anthony Taylor: how about you anything. This is like, something's up with y'all's systems or something.

643
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.640
Baro, Sonja: Aye.

644
00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:36.490
Anthony Taylor: Perhaps I don't. I don't know for sure. So we're gonna wait and see what happens until that.

645
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.740
Baro, Sonja: Let me do it and pull it up.

646
00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:41.580
Anthony Taylor: I just. I made the the gross assumption

647
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:46.790
Anthony Taylor: earlier when I was going through all this stuff today, that since it all worked

648
00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.590
Anthony Taylor: on the first try that we wouldn't want into.

649
00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:50.980
Anthony Taylor: Have to use Covid.

650
00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.550
Anthony Taylor: Are you still waiting, Derek?

651
00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:02.000
Derek Rikke: Oh, I started in Co. Lab, and it

652
00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:03.490
Derek Rikke: worked in co-lead.

653
00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:03.925
Anthony Taylor: Oh.

654
00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:07.080
Anthony Taylor: okay, somebody who didn't work for

655
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:13.020
Anthony Taylor: go into Co. Lab and do it. You want to try it, Sonya, or Rodney or Clayton

656
00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:16.109
Anthony Taylor: Matt. You said yours didn't work right.

657
00:39:18.094 --> 00:39:19.199
Dipinto, Matt: I was fine for this one.

658
00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:20.650
Anthony Taylor: Oh, okay.

659
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:24.390
Anthony Taylor: I could. Then there's one's good for.

660
00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.009
Anthony Taylor: Go ahead. Sorry.

661
00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:32.142
Mason, Natalie: I was just I got an error in the second. So

662
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.009
Mason, Natalie: It's saying no.

663
00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:35.890
Anthony Taylor: Which which one are you doing in this?

664
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:37.279
Anthony Taylor: The yeah.

665
00:39:37.906 --> 00:39:39.160
Mason, Natalie: Es code.

666
00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:43.010
Anthony Taylor: Did you got? Did you saw your transformers.

667
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:47.010
Mason, Natalie: Yes.

668
00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:53.749
Anthony Taylor: Try that one more time, because that's what the message you just said.

669
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:54.790
Mason, Natalie: It. Okay.

670
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:55.660
Anthony Taylor: Would have been.

671
00:39:57.330 --> 00:40:00.726
Baro, Sonja: Anthony, I'm trying again, and, Collab, I'll let you know what happens.

672
00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:01.960
Anthony Taylor: Sonia.

673
00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:03.650
Anthony Taylor: I like your background.

674
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:13.063
Baro, Sonja: You know I'm a cross marketing. It's the image I did from my last post, my most recent post on

675
00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:18.519
Baro, Sonja: Linkedin. It's called the Art and Science of Machine Learning.

676
00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:19.586
Mason, Natalie: Very cool.

677
00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.340
Baro, Sonja: Yes.

678
00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:23.480
Anthony Taylor: She's a prolific writer.

679
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:27.620
Baro, Sonja: Oh, it's called marketing is what I'm trying to do.

680
00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.310
Mason, Natalie: But yes.

681
00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:40.790
Baro, Sonja: It. It took a few iterations with Dolly to get that, but it was cool, I was like, Oh, it's so pretty!

682
00:40:44.816 --> 00:40:45.889
Baro, Sonja: Let's see.

683
00:40:46.936 --> 00:40:51.410
Mason, Natalie: Mine says, could not install packages due to an OS error.

684
00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:52.679
Mason, Natalie: No file.

685
00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:54.280
Anthony Taylor: And would share it with us.

686
00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.990
Anthony Taylor: Perpet, please.

687
00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:02.179
Anthony Taylor: while Sonya does her Google Co Lab thing, we're doing really good today. So I'm not, too.

688
00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:03.030
Anthony Taylor: This, me.

689
00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:07.120
Mason, Natalie: Okay, so.

690
00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:11.003
Anthony Taylor: No, that.

691
00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:19.299
Anthony Taylor: yeah. I hate it. When that happens.

692
00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:24.130
Anthony Taylor: go

693
00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:26.520
Anthony Taylor: right here.

694
00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:32.199
Anthony Taylor: Click on that python 3 12.2.

695
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:36.450
Anthony Taylor: Select another kernel

696
00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:40.830
Anthony Taylor: python environments

697
00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:44.859
Anthony Taylor: click on aniconda 3.

698
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:48.690
Anthony Taylor: Try this again.

699
00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:59.925
Anthony Taylor: And then, if that works, you'll need to do radio again, too. Probably.

700
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.850
Mason, Natalie: Okay.

701
00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:03.580
Anthony Taylor: If not, go to code.

702
00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:04.640
Mason, Natalie: Okay.

703
00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:06.650
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

704
00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:13.439
Anthony Taylor: And I can go to Colette if that if if makes everybody feel more warm, Fuzzy, I don't mind.

705
00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:21.240
Anthony Taylor: I thought maybe radio was. Gonna let not not be. But see, it's not. Radio is not actually causing problem.

706
00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:23.649
Anthony Taylor: The problem is coming from

707
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:26.170
Anthony Taylor: the transformers.

708
00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:28.330
Anthony Taylor: because.

709
00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:30.309
Anthony Taylor: as Clayton will tell you.

710
00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:33.439
Clayton Graves: More than meets the eye.

711
00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:35.529
Anthony Taylor: God that was so.

712
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:36.700
Anthony Taylor: Clayton.

713
00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.100
Anthony Taylor: you are amazing!

714
00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:39.720
Clayton Graves: Okay.

715
00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:40.370
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

716
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:43.599
Clayton Graves: I rebrand it and Google full lab. And it works.

717
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:45.870
Anthony Taylor: So. Yes, let's.

718
00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:48.040
michael mcpherson: Like better than transformers.

719
00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:50.490
Anthony Taylor: What was that?

720
00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:54.600
michael mcpherson: Silver hawks are much better than transformers.

721
00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:59.039
Anthony Taylor: Why do I have to request access? I am.

722
00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:04.860
Masarirambi, Rodney: Like this time. Leave.

723
00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:07.390
Anthony Taylor: I think so.

724
00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:13.060
Masarirambi, Rodney: I guess Google that works so much better.

725
00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:16.420
Anthony Taylor: In this case. Yeah.

726
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:17.699
Anthony Taylor: that's all right.

727
00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:21.309
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. Well.

728
00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:24.212
Anthony Taylor: good. So you guys are going into the exercise.

729
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:26.760
Clayton Graves: I've got. I've got one more question.

730
00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:28.390
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, sure, anything.

731
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:29.619
Clayton Graves: And then we can move on.

732
00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:31.650
Clayton Graves: Why.

733
00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:38.000
Clayton Graves: why, when my my laptop is perfectly capable of running this code without any any problems.

734
00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:39.320
Clayton Graves: does it

735
00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.530
Clayton Graves: only work from Google Colon?

736
00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:43.450
Clayton Graves: Why is that be.

737
00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:46.869
Anthony Taylor: Because they have live like. For instance.

738
00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:49.080
Anthony Taylor: all the machine learning stuff

739
00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:52.220
Anthony Taylor: is already installed on a Google Co lab cluster.

740
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:55.720
Anthony Taylor: So they have libraries that are installed.

741
00:43:55.770 --> 00:44:00.509
Anthony Taylor: and the clusters are configured specifically for

742
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:06.199
Anthony Taylor: running these python things. Stuff like that. So like Natalie's problem, she had

743
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:08.614
Anthony Taylor: her python was in

744
00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:12.480
Anthony Taylor: a folder that she needed administrative access to get to

745
00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:15.229
Anthony Taylor: so she couldn't install the package.

746
00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:17.129
Anthony Taylor: They don't have to worry about that. And Colette.

747
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:18.669
Anthony Taylor: right? Stuff like that.

748
00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.530
Anthony Taylor: It's just yeah. That's just how it's built.

749
00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:25.130
Anthony Taylor: But yeah.

750
00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:29.779
Anthony Taylor: you can even change the Runtime type if one too many. It's honestly.

751
00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:36.359
Anthony Taylor: Google Web is a very, very. I wouldn't be offended if we always did it in Google.

752
00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:41.740
Anthony Taylor: right? I usually don't, just because it feels easier to just open Pso do it.

753
00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:43.570
Anthony Taylor: So

754
00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:45.510
Anthony Taylor: that's all.

755
00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:50.600
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So sounds like we're past that. Yes.

756
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:52.780
Baro, Sonja: Yes, it fixed it.

757
00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:53.460
Anthony Taylor: Awesome.

758
00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:59.459
Anthony Taylor: awesome. Alright. So you guys are going to do your own text summarization.

759
00:45:00.295 --> 00:45:02.849
Anthony Taylor: You're gonna use the summarized function.

760
00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:06.049
Anthony Taylor: that's pretty much it

761
00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:09.299
Anthony Taylor: alright, and you can do it. I would suggest

762
00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:10.810
Anthony Taylor: Google Colette

763
00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:13.510
Anthony Taylor: if it worked at Vs codes. You're probably fine.

764
00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:15.250
Anthony Taylor: but otherwise

765
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:17.379
Anthony Taylor: feel free to go do it. And Google call that.

766
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:19.090
Anthony Taylor: And for this one

767
00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.170
Anthony Taylor: you have

768
00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:25.720
Anthony Taylor: 10Â min.

769
00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:27.219
Anthony Taylor: which makes sense.

770
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:28.940
Anthony Taylor: It's not very long.

771
00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:31.310
Anthony Taylor: I

772
00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:34.240
Anthony Taylor: alright everybody

773
00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.260
Anthony Taylor: welcome back.

774
00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:38.300
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

775
00:45:38.645 --> 00:45:42.100
Clayton Graves: But when she launches the app in Google Co Lab.

776
00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:44.500
Anthony Taylor: Let me see

777
00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:47.680
Anthony Taylor: share Sandiel stuff.

778
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:48.960
Anthony Taylor: Show us.

779
00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:01.640
Kevin Nguyen: Cindy.

780
00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:03.199
Clayton Graves: What's going on, Cindy?

781
00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:05.499
Sihong Zhou: Okay, I'm trying to share screen.

782
00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:07.270
Sihong Zhou: Oh, okay.

783
00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:12.900
Sihong Zhou: And where is it? Let me see.

784
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:16.890
Sihong Zhou: should be this one. Yeah.

785
00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:27.630
Sihong Zhou: yeah, I I don't know why it doesn't work on my this code, but here it works fine.

786
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:29.070
Anthony Taylor: Oh, okay.

787
00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:29.420
Sihong Zhou: Yeah.

788
00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:31.400
Anthony Taylor: That's that's all we needed to hear.

789
00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:34.620
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, like, I said a minute ago, in

790
00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:38.149
Anthony Taylor: yeah, it's sometimes it's not gonna work on Vs code.

791
00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:39.909
Anthony Taylor: Oh, that's good! Alright!

792
00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:41.750
Sihong Zhou: That's it, Harry. You did the you did.

793
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:42.500
Clayton Graves: Do you? Don't mind?

794
00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.020
Sihong Zhou: Lunch, anything.

795
00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:46.749
Clayton Graves: This isn't Vs code. This is Google, Colab.

796
00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:52.459
Sihong Zhou: Yeah, it works fine here, but it didn't launch anything. Isn't the correct.

797
00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:53.480
Anthony Taylor: Oh, I see!

798
00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:54.350
Derek Rikke: So interesting.

799
00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:58.409
Derek Rikke: The app and app launcher in the function.

800
00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:00.279
Sihong Zhou: Are all.

801
00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:01.130
Anthony Taylor: Oh, yeah.

802
00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:01.840
Sihong Zhou: Yeah, yeah.

803
00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.690
Anthony Taylor: Good! Hi! Derek!

804
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:10.099
Sihong Zhou: so now it works right should be.

805
00:47:10.785 --> 00:47:12.619
Anthony Taylor: Okay, okay, there it is. Okay.

806
00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:13.273
Sihong Zhou: Thank you.

807
00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:14.340
Anthony Taylor: Aye, yeah.

808
00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:15.490
Clayton Graves: Nice catch perfect.

809
00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:15.770
Sihong Zhou: Yeah.

810
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:18.220
Anthony Taylor: That was fast dude.

811
00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:22.869
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So let's just quickly go through this guy here.

812
00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:24.600
Anthony Taylor: Then we can.

813
00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.650
Anthony Taylor: Well, we could do one more thing.

814
00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:30.670
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, we'll try.

815
00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:32.870
Anthony Taylor: So I mean

816
00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:39.240
Anthony Taylor: to be honest, this is pretty much the same thing right, except for now we've added a little more complex function.

817
00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:41.489
Anthony Taylor: So we have

818
00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:44.010
Anthony Taylor: our transformers and our pipeline.

819
00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:57.099
Anthony Taylor: Actually, this looks almost exactly like what I I did except for in this one. You're going to get the text out of here.

820
00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:59.470
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So

821
00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:02.370
Anthony Taylor: going to create our pipeline.

822
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:05.249
Anthony Taylor: we're going to read in the text file

823
00:48:06.590 --> 00:48:08.270
Anthony Taylor: to AI text

824
00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:12.549
Anthony Taylor: it it I would get. Did anybody

825
00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:14.289
Anthony Taylor: just out of curiosity.

826
00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:17.460
Anthony Taylor: Use AI text as

827
00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:22.539
Anthony Taylor: the input like, well, I guess you can't, because you're doing it through the Gui up.

828
00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:25.879
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Are we in the same exercise? Is this.

829
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:29.029
Masarirambi, Rodney: I don't think it's the same one cause we don't have that.

830
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.820
Baro, Sonja: Yeah.

831
00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:33.180
Baro, Sonja: you you're in the student one

832
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:34.570
Baro, Sonja: that we just did.

833
00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:36.089
Anthony Taylor: So when you're you just did.

834
00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:37.080
Anthony Taylor: hey?

835
00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:40.499
Meredith McCanse (she/her): The uns, the unsolved one doesn't have. We didn't read anything in.

836
00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:42.040
Baro, Sonja: Yeah.

837
00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:44.360
Baro, Sonja: that's what's strange.

838
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:50.328
Meredith McCanse (she/her): We just copied it from the Cla. The class exercise to have something.

839
00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.350
Anthony Taylor: I

840
00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:56.979
Anthony Taylor: did this just because I wanted to try it out

841
00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:59.490
Anthony Taylor: alright. So I

842
00:48:59.510 --> 00:49:02.019
Anthony Taylor: went ahead and just read this in directly.

843
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:06.959
Anthony Taylor: Okay from the art from the the thing itself.

844
00:49:07.643 --> 00:49:12.720
Anthony Taylor: so that you know you could do this, and then it printed it out and you could copy, paste it.

845
00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:17.149
Anthony Taylor: And then you're gonna have the same function that we did in the other one

846
00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:19.470
Anthony Taylor: and same interface.

847
00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:23.439
Anthony Taylor: And then you do app, launch, and away you go. So

848
00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:31.129
Anthony Taylor: if you were doing this, what I wanted to do, and maybe this is might be what I was thinking of when I start when I did this earlier.

849
00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:34.590
Anthony Taylor: I wanted to come up with a file pick

850
00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:39.220
Anthony Taylor: right? So I could just put a file name in here

851
00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.200
Anthony Taylor: and it would open up over here on the right.

852
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:43.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

853
00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:47.360
Anthony Taylor: but for the most part, if you copy and paste it here.

854
00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:50.150
Anthony Taylor: you should have gotten your summary there this time.

855
00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:57.770
Raugewitz, Tania: So we have a question, if we wanted to add more input fields into the user interface?

856
00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:05.479
Raugewitz, Tania: I mean, can can we do that in the, in the we define our summarize parameters.

857
00:50:07.148 --> 00:50:11.930
Anthony Taylor: If you needed more parameters. Yes, but if you just needed more

858
00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:16.339
Anthony Taylor: blocks are more things to put in here, you would put it

859
00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:17.760
Anthony Taylor: in here now.

860
00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:22.850
Anthony Taylor: And and and I don't know all of the functionality of radio yet.

861
00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:27.810
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but it's pretty much just to call one function.

862
00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:30.170
Anthony Taylor: Does that make sense to everybody.

863
00:50:30.310 --> 00:50:34.489
Anthony Taylor: So whatever you put in here, it's gonna assume

864
00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:38.109
Anthony Taylor: you have an input to the function for that item.

865
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:41.260
Anthony Taylor: Does that make sense.

866
00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:46.950
Raugewitz, Tania: Okay. So like, when we did the save the savings interest calculator

867
00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:48.560
Raugewitz, Tania: in the.

868
00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:49.300
Anthony Taylor: Yes.

869
00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:51.859
Raugewitz, Tania: Function. It had balance Apr. And days.

870
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:53.350
Anthony Taylor: Ray.

871
00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:58.690
Anthony Taylor: If you wanted to add one, you could. But what would it it would. It wouldn't have anywhere to go.

872
00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:00.450
Anthony Taylor: Make sense.

873
00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:07.759
Gebrekristos, Haftom: We were actually trying to. We were actually trying to get those minimum length Max lines, as you know.

874
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:10.769
Gebrekristos, Haftom: to take it from the interface.

875
00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:14.819
Anthony Taylor: Right. So if you so if you go back and look at the

876
00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:17.600
Anthony Taylor: as an example, okay.

877
00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:21.209
Anthony Taylor: you have. So this is the one I was just showing you, with all the different

878
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:25.250
Anthony Taylor: it has. All these different icons are are different options.

879
00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:26.320
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

880
00:51:26.410 --> 00:51:28.400
Anthony Taylor: You can certainly.

881
00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:32.290
Anthony Taylor: creates

882
00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:34.490
Anthony Taylor: an interface

883
00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.990
Anthony Taylor: and say, here's the function.

884
00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:44.609
Anthony Taylor: Here's, oh, okay. Well, this, this answers the question right here. So here's the interface or the function right that you're gonna call.

885
00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:46.789
Anthony Taylor: Here's the inputs

886
00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.720
Anthony Taylor: to that function.

887
00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:51.000
Anthony Taylor: So these are all the inputs we created

888
00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:52.540
Anthony Taylor: for this function.

889
00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.879
Anthony Taylor: And then we just said

890
00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:56.180
Anthony Taylor: text.

891
00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:58.980
Anthony Taylor: and this is just the output. That's it.

892
00:51:59.390 --> 00:52:01.840
Anthony Taylor: So when you look at this one down here.

893
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:08.519
Anthony Taylor: all of these top ones are going to be what goes into that function. But you could see down here we just have.

894
00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:10.019
Anthony Taylor: This is just stuff.

895
00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:11.739
Anthony Taylor: It doesn't do anything.

896
00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:13.750
Anthony Taylor: So I guess you could do it that way.

897
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.189
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, looking just looking at how this is configured.

898
00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:20.180
Anthony Taylor: This first variable

899
00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:25.429
Anthony Taylor: is the function you're gonna call the after the comma is all of the things.

900
00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:27.989
Anthony Taylor: All the arguments for that function

901
00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:30.650
Anthony Taylor: is that order.

902
00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:34.240
Raugewitz, Tania: You could. So could you just kind of put that demo example

903
00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:36.450
Raugewitz, Tania: in slack, or something like that?

904
00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:40.449
Anthony Taylor: Sure, of course. Well, I mean I I I gave you all the link to it, but absolutely, if you want.

905
00:52:40.450 --> 00:52:41.689
Raugewitz, Tania: Oh, she did. Okay.

906
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:43.710
Anthony Taylor: I don't mind. Yeah, that was the link that

907
00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:45.869
Anthony Taylor: I showed you guys

908
00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:48.090
Anthony Taylor: here. I'll show you again. That's fine.

909
00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:49.600
Anthony Taylor: I don't mind.

910
00:52:50.850 --> 00:52:52.879
Anthony Taylor: Where did I have it up

911
00:52:56.410 --> 00:52:57.910
Anthony Taylor: here? This ought to work.

912
00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.899
Anthony Taylor: So there, there's the actual one. I just showed you

913
00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:12.529
Anthony Taylor: right. And then here's the code. You can even do open and Co lab directly. But yeah, so this is, it's just actually, I really like this guys.

914
00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:14.230
Anthony Taylor: the block layout.

915
00:53:14.850 --> 00:53:16.489
Anthony Taylor: It's really pretty cool.

916
00:53:17.290 --> 00:53:20.130
Anthony Taylor: And you could do a lot of stuff with this basically

917
00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:23.440
Anthony Taylor: creates like a little blob. It's kind of cool.

918
00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:27.140
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, radio isn't meant to replace like

919
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:29.280
Anthony Taylor: Javascript or

920
00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:38.510
Anthony Taylor: any major application interface. Okay, but it's fantastic for working with dogging face stuff.

921
00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:41.170
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So

922
00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:42.710
Anthony Taylor: love it.

923
00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:43.640
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

924
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:46.709
Anthony Taylor: real quick. Let's look at

925
00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:50.559
Anthony Taylor: a little late but not bad.

926
00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:53.659
Anthony Taylor: Let's look at this guy.

927
00:53:59.550 --> 00:54:00.490
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

928
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:08.069
Anthony Taylor: so all we're doing here. If you already have imports on Vs code, you're good. If you're doing Google Co lab, remember to rerun those

929
00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:14.360
Anthony Taylor: bringing in transformers and radio, we're doing the same summarization model as before.

930
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:19.160
Anthony Taylor: same call as before.

931
00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:21.489
Anthony Taylor: What are we adding in this way.

932
00:54:25.330 --> 00:54:27.330
Anthony Taylor: we're just making it look a little nicer.

933
00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:29.124
Anthony Taylor: So we have a couple of

934
00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:32.390
Gebrekristos, Haftom: Oh, nice! Actually, that's what we are trying to do.

935
00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:33.490
Clayton Graves: There's a.

936
00:54:33.727 --> 00:54:34.440
Anthony Taylor: There you go!

937
00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:36.400
Clayton Graves: Folder do we need about that.

938
00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:38.230
Anthony Taylor: What's that? Button

939
00:54:38.830 --> 00:54:43.329
Anthony Taylor: the resources folder? If you want to pull the stuff with summarization. Yeah.

940
00:54:43.330 --> 00:54:43.930
Clayton Graves: Okay.

941
00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:45.410
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, yeah.

942
00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:50.340
Anthony Taylor: okay, so here, we have, we have a title on this page.

943
00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:52.600
Anthony Taylor: right? And then just our inputs.

944
00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:57.139
Anthony Taylor: and our outputs is a text box. We can label it differently.

945
00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:59.559
Anthony Taylor: We could even put a copy button in there.

946
00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:01.590
Anthony Taylor: And when we run this one

947
00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:04.730
Anthony Taylor: it looks like this pretty nice.

948
00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:08.130
Anthony Taylor: This is what you were saying after you wanted just a bigger box.

949
00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:11.699
Gebrekristos, Haftom: Yeah, yeah, that's what we were trying to do.

950
00:55:13.350 --> 00:55:15.750
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, that's cool, good, good.

951
00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:18.220
Anthony Taylor: And then the Max output. You can.

952
00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:25.989
Anthony Taylor: Well, if you change this, it'll make the summarization longer. So I'm gonna do 10. See what comes up with.

953
00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:30.930
Anthony Taylor: Oh, well, it didn't.

954
00:55:31.610 --> 00:55:37.789
Anthony Taylor: Alright. There are tuners that you could put in these summarizations models where you can say, only use

955
00:55:37.890 --> 00:55:39.529
Anthony Taylor: 10 words or whatever.

956
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:40.569
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

957
00:55:41.610 --> 00:55:43.400
Anthony Taylor: then we have this one.

958
00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:47.309
Anthony Taylor: We're going to default the value to 150.

959
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:49.500
Anthony Taylor: Otherwise it's exactly the same.

960
00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:52.319
Anthony Taylor: Think we just defaulted it.

961
00:55:54.274 --> 00:55:56.369
Anthony Taylor: And then this one.

962
00:55:56.590 --> 00:56:00.799
Anthony Taylor: we're doing the summarizer. We're passing in Max Link, Min link.

963
00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:10.509
Anthony Taylor: And this one has a lot more functionality. So you can see, we have the text box. It's gonna have 5 lines. It's gonna have a placeholder.

964
00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:12.470
Anthony Taylor: a different label.

965
00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:14.530
Anthony Taylor: It's going to be interactive.

966
00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:17.859
Anthony Taylor: So you can make them. So they're not. We have a slider

967
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.580
Anthony Taylor: from 10 to 30

968
00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:22.750
Anthony Taylor: minimum number of words.

969
00:56:23.790 --> 00:56:29.170
Anthony Taylor: and then another Slider 120 to 150 maximum number words to summarize with.

970
00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:31.760
Anthony Taylor: and then our text box.

971
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.369
Anthony Taylor: And it looks

972
00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:34.410
Anthony Taylor: like

973
00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:36.319
Anthony Taylor: this. Look at that.

974
00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:38.000
Anthony Taylor: That's pretty nifty.

975
00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:40.150
Anthony Taylor: right?

976
00:56:50.370 --> 00:56:51.350
Anthony Taylor: I like it.

977
00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:59.989
Anthony Taylor: So all this was is really to show you that you could do a lot more. And all of this in that documentation guys. So don't get too

978
00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:05.839
Anthony Taylor: too worried about it, you know. Oh, what do you do to get that?

979
00:57:05.970 --> 00:57:08.929
Anthony Taylor: You? You know we can go through the functions more.

980
00:57:09.130 --> 00:57:11.030
Anthony Taylor: We'll go through this 1 one more time.

981
00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:13.820
Anthony Taylor: But the bottom line is is. There's

982
00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:16.500
Anthony Taylor: every one of these boxes

983
00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:18.599
Anthony Taylor: here, let me bring this back over. Actually.

984
00:57:21.150 --> 00:57:23.070
Anthony Taylor: So let's look at

985
00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:26.470
Anthony Taylor: the text because we were looking at text. Right?

986
00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:28.669
Anthony Taylor: So here's our text box.

987
00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:34.320
Anthony Taylor: and this is just some examples. But here's all the different arguments.

988
00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:37.810
Anthony Taylor: So lines, Max lines a placeholder, a label.

989
00:57:39.710 --> 00:57:43.399
Anthony Taylor: It's an additional info that you could put on the box itself.

990
00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:47.310
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this is a function that you can run off.

991
00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:49.819
Anthony Taylor: You put the show label or not.

992
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:53.169
Anthony Taylor: Alright. There's just tons, I mean, look at that.

993
00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:54.729
Anthony Taylor: So much stuff.

994
00:57:55.720 --> 00:58:02.829
Anthony Taylor: Okay, cool thing is, do note, these all have demos, and most of them.

995
00:58:03.290 --> 00:58:07.349
Anthony Taylor: Oh, this one doesn't have examples. But as the demo, so you could see the demo.

996
00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:09.000
Anthony Taylor: here's Hello, world.

997
00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:11.010
Anthony Taylor: Here's another one you can play with

998
00:58:11.450 --> 00:58:13.470
Anthony Taylor: shows difference in the text.

999
00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:15.299
Anthony Taylor: Your sentence, builder.

1000
00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:17.459
Anthony Taylor: that's the one we were looking at earlier.

1001
00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:22.579
Anthony Taylor: another thing. Here they got the examples.

1002
00:58:22.730 --> 00:58:25.699
Anthony Taylor: You could select all kinds of things and see

1003
00:58:25.950 --> 00:58:27.589
Anthony Taylor: how this stuff works.

1004
00:58:28.050 --> 00:58:33.620
Anthony Taylor: So there is a lot of very, very cool stuff just real quick. Before we go off the break I will show you

1005
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:35.320
Anthony Taylor: one more thing.

1006
00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:39.950
Anthony Taylor: This is what I'm working on for you trying to get to work.

1007
00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:44.340
Anthony Taylor: It doesn't seem like it's that hard, but it's being very

1008
00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:49.729
Anthony Taylor: annoying. So in your login to hugging phase.

1009
00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:52.340
Anthony Taylor: You can actually create a space

1010
00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:57.970
Anthony Taylor: call a space. I wanted to go to my space, not my space.

1011
00:58:58.060 --> 00:58:59.310
Anthony Taylor: That's not a thing

1012
00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:02.409
Anthony Taylor: I mean to say that

1013
00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:05.219
Anthony Taylor: Where'd it go?

1014
00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:07.646
Anthony Taylor: Not there.

1015
00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:10.810
Clayton Graves: And cause you all would have been in my top 10.

1016
00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:13.909
Anthony Taylor: Look at how sweet you are!

1017
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:16.060
michael mcpherson: Wasn't it? 8? Top 8.

1018
00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:17.120
Clayton Graves: I thought I was James.

1019
00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:22.740
Masarirambi, Rodney: Exactly why you were saying top 10, because we were going to be all gonna be 9 and 10. That's what he meant.

1020
00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:24.890
Masarirambi, Rodney: No.

1021
00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:25.410
Anthony Taylor: I.

1022
00:59:25.410 --> 00:59:27.220
michael mcpherson: You're now reminding me. It was.

1023
00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:28.140
Clayton Graves: Hello!

1024
00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:32.880
Anthony Taylor: I can't find my space

1025
00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:35.310
Anthony Taylor: profile.

1026
00:59:36.310 --> 00:59:39.130
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Well, oh, wait. There we go class desk.

1027
00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:42.710
Anthony Taylor: So basically, it's a get clone guys.

1028
00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:46.790
Anthony Taylor: you clone it down. It creates folder.

1029
00:59:46.990 --> 00:59:50.460
Anthony Taylor: you create an app and you push it up. Now I will tell you

1030
00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:53.310
Anthony Taylor: what I'm struggling with at the moment

1031
00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:54.870
Anthony Taylor: is a

1032
00:59:55.300 --> 01:00:01.070
Anthony Taylor: you have to create a key, and you either have to put it in here or figure out how to get it

1033
01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:07.080
Anthony Taylor: on your system. That's what I'm working through right now, if I get that figured out in time

1034
01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.080
Anthony Taylor: rate.

1035
01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.480
Anthony Taylor: I I don't know if I will today. Cause. But yeah.

1036
01:00:12.490 --> 01:00:15.539
Anthony Taylor: But the point is. Once you have this.

1037
01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:19.550
Anthony Taylor: you can.

1038
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.930
Anthony Taylor: Garnet.

1039
01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:25.839
Anthony Taylor: trying to get back to my spaces. Sorry.

1040
01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:31.609
Anthony Taylor: There we go, Myspace, so you can actually come and

1041
01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:36.959
Anthony Taylor: create. And you can make errors. You can make your own errors just like that.

1042
01:00:38.350 --> 01:00:40.070
Anthony Taylor: That space is turned off.

1043
01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:42.310
Anthony Taylor: that space is turned on.

1044
01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:48.529
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, so you'll be able to push your radio apps up to here.

1045
01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:52.839
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if you want to see other examples, you could come in here

1046
01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:57.640
Anthony Taylor: and see. You know, like, this is a radio app, that's all. It is

1047
01:00:59.810 --> 01:01:01.589
Anthony Taylor: alright. Very simple.

1048
01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:04.400
Anthony Taylor: Okie Toky.

1049
01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:06.820
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So what we'll do

1050
01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:10.790
Anthony Taylor: you do have a quick activity on this

1051
01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:16.009
Anthony Taylor: We'll do it when you get back from break.

1052
01:01:18.810 --> 01:01:20.300
Anthony Taylor: And

1053
01:01:20.650 --> 01:01:22.040
Anthony Taylor: then

1054
01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:24.959
Anthony Taylor: we have a fun thing to do for you.

1055
01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:28.490
Anthony Taylor: Actually.

1056
01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:34.109
Anthony Taylor: you know what? Let's not. Let's do this now and then go to break and then do the fun thing.

1057
01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:38.760
Anthony Taylor: Okay, cause this is only a 15Â min one. So basically

1058
01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:47.530
Anthony Taylor: it's you're gonna do the same thing. But you're gonna do a question and answer.

1059
01:01:49.170 --> 01:01:51.069
Anthony Taylor: okay, so

1060
01:01:52.050 --> 01:01:58.519
Anthony Taylor: just to help you along a little bit. Hopefully, they gave you the model. But if they didn't go back and look at Thursday, it looks like they

1061
01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:00.190
Anthony Taylor: dude. That's

1062
01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.010
Anthony Taylor: that's to solve. Don't look.

1063
01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:08.890
Anthony Taylor: That's so weird that that's in there.

1064
01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:11.309
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So

1065
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:17.340
Anthony Taylor: the idea is to get the question and answer pipeline. You did the other day and use it

1066
01:02:17.890 --> 01:02:18.965
Anthony Taylor: alright.

1067
01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:27.660
Anthony Taylor: trying to think if I want to give you some of it. So you don't have. Do you guys have this anymore

1068
01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:29.320
Anthony Taylor: the solution one

1069
01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:34.269
Anthony Taylor: or is that from yesterday or the other day?

1070
01:02:35.050 --> 01:02:37.770
Anthony Taylor: Oh, yeah, this is a different one. Do you guys have this in yours?

1071
01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:44.039
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yes, we do.

1072
01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:44.790
Sihong Zhou: Yes.

1073
01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:47.300
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright good. So that should help you

1074
01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:48.949
Anthony Taylor: with the the stuff.

1075
01:02:49.110 --> 01:02:54.089
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So 15Â min. Knock this puppy out. I'll see you in 15. After that we'll do great

1076
01:03:12.290 --> 01:03:14.330
Anthony Taylor: welcome, Bob.

1077
01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:18.530
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So how'd you guys do with that?

1078
01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:25.130
Anthony Taylor: So good. Okay, what Derek? What'd you say?

1079
01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:26.140
michael mcpherson: We made it through.

1080
01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:30.170
Derek Rikke: We did. Okay, kind of

1081
01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:31.540
Derek Rikke: messing some stuff up.

1082
01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:32.640
Derek Rikke: figuring out.

1083
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:37.840
Anthony Taylor: Well on the plus side. I was able to get

1084
01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:41.419
Anthony Taylor: the hugging space upload to work. But

1085
01:03:41.890 --> 01:03:46.750
Anthony Taylor: it's still failing for some bizarre reason. But let's take a look at this real quick.

1086
01:03:53.490 --> 01:03:54.680
Anthony Taylor: How food!

1087
01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:59.339
Anthony Taylor: I think this is the one I was actually trying to get to work on bugging space.

1088
01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:03.169
Anthony Taylor: So we bring in our transformers in our radio.

1089
01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:06.220
Anthony Taylor: We have our question to answer. Pipeline.

1090
01:04:06.550 --> 01:04:10.830
Anthony Taylor: Distilbert. Did anybody mention you who Stillbert is older than me?

1091
01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:14.670
Anthony Taylor: It's so slow.

1092
01:04:16.170 --> 01:04:20.460
Anthony Taylor: It's really not. But it's pretty much out there. It's been around for a long time

1093
01:04:20.810 --> 01:04:23.570
Anthony Taylor: long before the stuff you guys see today.

1094
01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:33.929
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So for our function, we passed in the text. Passing the question, we run our question, answer, or pipeline passing in our question and our context.

1095
01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:38.279
Anthony Taylor: and then we return the answer, the scores, the start. And yet.

1096
01:04:39.570 --> 01:04:41.799
Anthony Taylor: you guys did do all that on Thursday. Yeah.

1097
01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:43.880
Anthony Taylor: okay, good.

1098
01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:46.730
Anthony Taylor: So for our interface.

1099
01:04:47.530 --> 01:04:51.509
Anthony Taylor: we tell it what function? These are the inputs to the function

1100
01:04:51.590 --> 01:04:53.219
Anthony Taylor: and our outputs.

1101
01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:57.440
Anthony Taylor: And then we run it. We launch it.

1102
01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:58.770
Anthony Taylor: bam.

1103
01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:02.740
Anthony Taylor: paste text to search.

1104
01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:06.299
Anthony Taylor: So this is our text to search.

1105
01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:19.939
Anthony Taylor: What? What silly question? I don't even know what that text was. What was it?

1106
01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:22.440
Anthony Taylor: Transformer? Is a deep learning model.

1107
01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:25.899
Anthony Taylor: Our transformers

1108
01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:28.180
Anthony Taylor: more

1109
01:05:30.730 --> 01:05:31.750
Anthony Taylor: then meets the

1110
01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.660
Anthony Taylor: It was about transformers right.

1111
01:05:36.353 --> 01:05:40.019
Baro, Sonja: They give 3 questions at the bottom

1112
01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.210
Baro, Sonja: to ask.

1113
01:05:42.030 --> 01:05:43.329
Anthony Taylor: Oh, well, I like Mike.

1114
01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:45.090
Baro, Sonja: I like yours better, too.

1115
01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:52.510
Anthony Taylor: Our transfer more than input, all probability score and location. So since it really wasn't there.

1116
01:05:52.530 --> 01:05:57.219
Anthony Taylor: we got like a really low probability score. So let's get the questions.

1117
01:05:57.350 --> 01:05:58.659
Anthony Taylor: Here they are.

1118
01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:04.080
Anthony Taylor: We'll do. I feel like one or 2 of these guys.

1119
01:06:09.150 --> 01:06:10.470
Anthony Taylor: Oh, my gosh!

1120
01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:12.120
Anthony Taylor: This thing is a pain.

1121
01:06:12.530 --> 01:06:13.740
Anthony Taylor: Submit.

1122
01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:17.240
Masarirambi, Rodney: Yeah, the scrollability is not the best on this.

1123
01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:22.839
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, especially if if you're doing like, if you just like, if we just went to a

1124
01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:30.760
Anthony Taylor: an external one like to the share one, it would be way easier just being a web page. Alright, anyway. So any questions about that

1125
01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:32.200
Anthony Taylor: how that worked

1126
01:06:32.330 --> 01:06:34.480
Anthony Taylor: bottom line is, you have a function.

1127
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:39.200
Anthony Taylor: You tell the radio interface what function you want to use. Give it the arguments

1128
01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.450
Anthony Taylor: and give it a place to put the output.

1129
01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:50.830
Anthony Taylor: chat, bot, chat, bot, chat. Bot, I will tell you. There's some really cool ones. We're not going to cover all of them, but really, really teary.

1130
01:06:51.590 --> 01:06:53.540
Anthony Taylor: maybe even after break.

1131
01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:59.569
Anthony Taylor: I want you guys to look, there's actually a new radio interface. It's called the Chat Interface.

1132
01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:06.310
Anthony Taylor: And guess what it does. It creates like a chat like Captain T with history, capability.

1133
01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:10.639
Anthony Taylor: So you say something. It gives you an answer. Say something. It gives you an answer.

1134
01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:21.109
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so there's a lot of cool stuff you can do with this. The main point of today was really just kind of introduce you to it and say, Have fun with it.

1135
01:07:21.330 --> 01:07:26.210
Anthony Taylor: But right now we're going to take a break. I'll see you in 15Â min. So just come back at

1136
01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:28.319
Anthony Taylor: 45Â min after the hour.

1137
01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:31.560
Anthony Taylor: and I'll see you there.

1138
01:07:36.550 --> 01:07:39.850
Derek Rikke: Alright. Well, basically, we just did the

1139
01:07:40.210 --> 01:07:41.650
Derek Rikke: question answering.

1140
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:46.959
Derek Rikke: model like the same one.

1141
01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:51.540
Derek Rikke: And we're just trying to find stuff to upload.

1142
01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:52.900
Derek Rikke: to ask

1143
01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:54.230
Derek Rikke: questions about.

1144
01:07:55.470 --> 01:07:57.980
Derek Rikke: I have this book. The alchemist has a Pdf.

1145
01:07:58.130 --> 01:07:59.030
Derek Rikke: so

1146
01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.679
Derek Rikke: we just use that one

1147
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:03.719
Derek Rikke: uploaded it as a Pdf.

1148
01:08:04.690 --> 01:08:06.270
Derek Rikke: but as the context.

1149
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:10.209
Anthony Taylor: Wow! How did it work? Did it work.

1150
01:08:10.750 --> 01:08:11.530
Derek Rikke: Well

1151
01:08:12.110 --> 01:08:13.210
Derek Rikke: asset

1152
01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:15.719
Derek Rikke: the question that it thinks for 2Â min, and then

1153
01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:17.100
Derek Rikke: gives an answer.

1154
01:08:17.229 --> 01:08:20.300
Derek Rikke: Ask, what's the meaning of life? And it said, keeps me alive.

1155
01:08:21.689 --> 01:08:25.303
Anthony Taylor: I suppose that is an accurate state.

1156
01:08:27.209 --> 01:08:29.218
Derek Rikke: I guess it's not wrong.

1157
01:08:30.779 --> 01:08:35.459
Clayton Graves: Now, the reason the reason we went with this was because the original

1158
01:08:36.449 --> 01:08:43.999
Clayton Graves: idea was that we were going to take Carl Sagan's 1983 report on the effects of nuclear war

1159
01:08:44.189 --> 01:08:49.019
Clayton Graves: when the term nuclear winter was first coined and we were gonna pump that in.

1160
01:08:49.829 --> 01:08:55.279
Clayton Graves: But because it's in a Pdf. We couldn't get it converted. I was working on it. We were almost there.

1161
01:08:55.279 --> 01:08:58.179
Anthony Taylor: Have to use Lane chain to do that. We're gonna learn that next week.

1162
01:09:00.519 --> 01:09:01.899
Anthony Taylor: So that's cool.

1163
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:09.269
Anthony Taylor: That's good. Alright. Well, anybody else got anything they want to show us, or tell us that they were thinking about.

1164
01:09:12.799 --> 01:09:13.629
Anthony Taylor: Go ahead, Nick.

1165
01:09:13.630 --> 01:09:20.230
Mason, Natalie: I thought that they were giving me a code for image generator, but it replied with text.

1166
01:09:20.770 --> 01:09:22.050
Mason, Natalie: So

1167
01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:27.240
Mason, Natalie: I mean, that's what I didn't understand in a way.

1168
01:09:27.569 --> 01:09:28.299
Mason, Natalie: what were you doing.

1169
01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:31.970
Anthony Taylor: Done an image generator, for we haven't done image generators.

1170
01:09:31.970 --> 01:09:37.252
Mason, Natalie: They had. It was on the instruction somewhere or.

1171
01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.540
Anthony Taylor: Hey, Kenny, I love that.

1172
01:09:39.939 --> 01:09:41.706
michael mcpherson: It was in the documents.

1173
01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:43.880
Mason, Natalie: Yeah, but.

1174
01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:46.450
Anthony Taylor: Oh, the radio documents. Oh, okay.

1175
01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:49.559
Anthony Taylor: Well, you have to load the right model for that. But yeah.

1176
01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:52.420
Mason, Natalie: Hmm, okay, that's cool.

1177
01:09:53.529 --> 01:09:54.849
Anthony Taylor: Yes, Marilyn.

1178
01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:55.769
Baro, Sonja: Go ahead, Meredith.

1179
01:09:55.770 --> 01:09:56.189
Anthony Taylor: Oh, wait!

1180
01:09:56.490 --> 01:09:57.160
Meredith McCanse (she/her): You know.

1181
01:09:57.582 --> 01:09:58.850
Baro, Sonja: We're same team.

1182
01:09:59.450 --> 01:10:02.480
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yeah. So we were trying. We

1183
01:10:02.850 --> 01:10:11.460
Meredith McCanse (she/her): we were trying a couple of different things. We were trying to create a translator app, so you could put something in in English and have it spit out another language.

1184
01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:12.800
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I can't remember

1185
01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:16.684
Meredith McCanse (she/her): right or German.

1186
01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:18.850
Anthony Taylor: Sin.

1187
01:10:19.210 --> 01:10:19.720
Meredith McCanse (she/her): That works.

1188
01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:26.019
Meredith McCanse (she/her): we got. We didn't quite get there like as a group.

1189
01:10:26.410 --> 01:10:33.110
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I asked Chat Gpt sort of while we were talking, and found something that sort of worked. But

1190
01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:34.980
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I didn't.

1191
01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:37.040
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I couldn't figure it out myself.

1192
01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:41.600
Meredith McCanse (she/her): or we, you know, we we were working on it. That was the goal we were trying to get to.

1193
01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:45.499
Anthony Taylor: I I love that that's cool. That is a very cool thing.

1194
01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:49.449
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Does anybody else want to tell us what the

1195
01:10:50.150 --> 01:10:52.320
Anthony Taylor: fun and exciting thing they did.

1196
01:10:55.080 --> 01:11:00.119
michael mcpherson: We're trying to just recreate a chat. But for chat gpt, it didn't work.

1197
01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:04.499
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Well, you can't do that without Openai, like. What? What model were you using.

1198
01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:06.250
michael mcpherson: Openai!

1199
01:11:07.090 --> 01:11:07.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1200
01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:08.370
michael mcpherson: It's just it's.

1201
01:11:08.370 --> 01:11:09.020
Anthony Taylor: Then.

1202
01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:11.709
michael mcpherson: It. It actually worked. But the

1203
01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:14.520
michael mcpherson: it says you can't use

1204
01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:18.280
michael mcpherson: dot completion. It's no longer supported.

1205
01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:21.750
michael mcpherson: So you have to use open AI migrate, which

1206
01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:24.280
michael mcpherson: then you close the room, so we never figured it out.

1207
01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:29.299
Anthony Taylor: Well, I'm glad you guys reached from Star.

1208
01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:34.230
Anthony Taylor: We are going to cover open AI and link chain next week. So

1209
01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:38.870
Anthony Taylor: alright, before we get into next week, though. Let's

1210
01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:44.459
Anthony Taylor: wrap up this week. Any other people want to show what they got.

1211
01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:51.820
Raugewitz, Tania: Well, we were with half of the gate. We were really close to getting the translation

1212
01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:54.760
Raugewitz, Tania: there. So that's what we were working on.

1213
01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:57.310
Anthony Taylor: Very cool.

1214
01:11:57.310 --> 01:11:58.470
Dipinto, Matt: We we did get.

1215
01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:58.950
Anthony Taylor: Again.

1216
01:11:58.950 --> 01:12:02.868
Dipinto, Matt: Inflation. One sort of going, I mean, it was just based on that

1217
01:12:03.630 --> 01:12:05.170
Dipinto, Matt: t 5 base

1218
01:12:05.730 --> 01:12:06.450
Dipinto, Matt: here.

1219
01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:09.420
Anthony Taylor: Very nice.

1220
01:12:09.709 --> 01:12:19.840
Dipinto, Matt: So you you put in your sentence, and then you tell it a language, and we were really fancy, and we gave it a random option which selects from a startling list of 3 languages.

1221
01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.399
Dipinto, Matt: and then you get

1222
01:12:23.730 --> 01:12:24.610
Dipinto, Matt: stuff.

1223
01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:28.889
Anthony Taylor: Group. She legally likes this data class.

1224
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:30.590
Anthony Taylor: Who?

1225
01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:32.310
Anthony Taylor: That's cool, though.

1226
01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:34.539
Dipinto, Matt: I don't think AI and Ml.

1227
01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:35.050
Anthony Taylor: After, aye.

1228
01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:35.910
Dipinto, Matt: But it's off.

1229
01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.209
Dipinto, Matt: hey? Ruined

1230
01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:40.940
Dipinto, Matt: and.

1231
01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:42.480
Anthony Taylor: Very very appreciative.

1232
01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:49.190
Dipinto, Matt: That's not right. It just gives you German. So it was like, your language is Swahili, and it's like Ikpan.

1233
01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:53.410
Anthony Taylor: Very cool.

1234
01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.359
Anthony Taylor: right? Well.

1235
01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:59.159
Anthony Taylor: that's good. I like all those. Those are fun.

1236
01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:06.199
Anthony Taylor: So I think that was almost all the groups. Yeah.

1237
01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:08.850
Anthony Taylor: did we miss anybody that wanted to talk

1238
01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:10.320
Anthony Taylor: any groups?

1239
01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:11.970
Anthony Taylor: Nay.

1240
01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:15.599
Anthony Taylor: awesome. Well, no spinning wheel of doom. Then

1241
01:13:18.010 --> 01:13:22.630
Anthony Taylor: alright gang. Well, next week, as in Wednesday.

1242
01:13:22.850 --> 01:13:27.489
Anthony Taylor: we will begin. Lane Chain lane chain is one of the last

1243
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:34.060
Anthony Taylor: discussions we'll have, and while we're using Lane chain we will. We will use Openai as a that

1244
01:13:36.150 --> 01:13:37.460
Anthony Taylor: linking.

1245
01:13:38.970 --> 01:13:43.649
Anthony Taylor: Well, we'll we'll let Lane chain explain itself on Wednesday. But it's amazing.

1246
01:13:43.770 --> 01:13:47.609
Anthony Taylor: and it has made coding. These chat bots

1247
01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:49.900
Anthony Taylor: ridiculously easy.

1248
01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:55.830
Anthony Taylor: And it gives us this cool functionality called an agent.

1249
01:13:55.870 --> 01:13:58.230
Anthony Taylor: which I think you guys are gonna really like.

1250
01:13:59.330 --> 01:14:00.490
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1251
01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:02.710

01:14:04.590 --> 01:14:06.000
Anthony Taylor: every time I say it.

1254
01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:08.160
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

1255
01:14:11.150 --> 01:14:13.180

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.210
Anthony Taylor: Secret agent man every time I think

1259
01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:22.380
Anthony Taylor: that's okay.

1260
01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:26.690
Anthony Taylor: I there's a number of things in the curriculum where I just I had to like

1261
01:14:27.770 --> 01:14:31.880
Anthony Taylor: I get. I get lost because I'm like thinking of something that someone once said.

1262
01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:35.520
Anthony Taylor: yeah. So

1263
01:14:36.090 --> 01:14:39.390
Anthony Taylor: that's pretty much it until Wednesday.

1264
01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:42.919
Anthony Taylor: and we'll be here for 30Â min and have a great

1265
