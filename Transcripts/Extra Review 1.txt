00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.109
Anthony Taylor: Ladies and gentlemen welcome.

2
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.789
Kanouff, Christine: you know, called it. There you go

3
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.529
Anthony Taylor: now, Moll, I over half the classes here I feel good.

4
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.219
Anthony Taylor: Alright, gang! Welcome. Welcome. Welcome

5
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:34.720
Anthony Taylor: our first extra review. Now, I'm gonna tell you guys little secret here. It's not a big secret. But Kevin James will tell you that this is true.

6
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:43.180
Anthony Taylor: Okay. this is going to add 5 times as much value

7
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.910
Anthony Taylor: to the dollar that you spent to get in this class as the whole damn class.

8
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.699
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Cause this is the stuff no one else is. Gonna get across the booth

9
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.160
Anthony Taylor: right? The things that we're gonna do in extra reviews. The whole idea

10
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:10.610
Anthony Taylor: is to give you guys a little extra from me to you. So pretty, exciting stuff. It's not to say that others don't get extra abuse. But

11
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.510
Anthony Taylor: whatever. Okay. So today, we're going to

12
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:22.149
Anthony Taylor: have a very short one, because this is our first one. Now, as I told you, each open AI Api key. If you want to

13
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:34.070
Anthony Taylor: play along. This is not really a code along, I'm going to. We'll we'll type code. Don't have a problem with that. But it's it's really meant that you can follow along later.

14
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.679
Anthony Taylor: So come back, watch the video.

15
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.260
Anthony Taylor: do what we do. And I'll also give you all of the code that I show you here in class today.

16
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.790
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so what is Openai? Well.

17
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.370
Anthony Taylor: Openai is kind of

18
00:01:50.250 --> 00:02:03.599
Anthony Taylor: the catalyst. It's the catalyst of why you're here today. not today. I haven't been around for 50 years past. Open AI itself has been around for very long time. but they basically opened

19
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.420
Anthony Taylor: the world

20
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.850
Anthony Taylor: by giving an Api that could allow you to interact

21
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:18.300
Anthony Taylor: with a large language model, a model that previously could only be interacted with by very

22
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.820
Anthony Taylor: expensive systems.

23
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.510
Anthony Taylor: It was completely unheard of

24
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.070
Anthony Taylor: that the citizen developer, all of you and me

25
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.470
Anthony Taylor: would be able to interact with these things. So

26
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:39.029
Anthony Taylor: when they did this, it kind of changed everything. And it's really the reason we have this this

27
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:47.380
Anthony Taylor: this course. the reason most of you are here is because of what Openai did. So what can you do? Well.

28
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:58.660
Anthony Taylor: the best example of what open AI's Apis do is, look at Chat Gp, today. Chad, Gpt exclusively. Uses Openai as does

29
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:08.700
Anthony Taylor: bing chat. Okay, co-pilot. If any of you guys have started using that. they all use the open AI Api.

30
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.450
Anthony Taylor: So so well, the cool thing here is we are going to

31
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.230
Anthony Taylor: basically learn how to do what chat Gt does. And if you're like, well, what? Well.

32
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.699
Anthony Taylor: we'll build into that. Yes.

33
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:33.410
sonja baro: I just have a question on the hierarchy of things like, so I thought, open. AI was a a company

34
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.580
sonja baro: that owned by is it owned by

35
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:57.209
sonja baro: Not Microsoft, but regardless they open AI, either their own company, right? And you just reference that, like other companies, what I would have called Gpt are utilizing Openai's large language model right

36
00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.770
Anthony Taylor: 100%.

37
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.359
sonja baro: And that was

38
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:09.890
Anthony Taylor: because it was faster to do it that way or do really good. Like, really good.

39
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:17.040
Anthony Taylor: Okay, when you compare, there's to like barred. So other Llms that are big in the industry right now barred is huge.

40
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:22.850
Anthony Taylor: Okay. When Bard first came out it was a joke. Everyone literally ridiculed it.

41
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.230
Anthony Taylor: Llama, which llama is a very interesting one, because

42
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.150
Anthony Taylor: it's it's Meta's first stop. Facebook.

43
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.719
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But what makes it kind of interesting is they open, sourced it.

44
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:44.370
Anthony Taylor: So while Openai gives us Apis to access it, llama went a step further. Facebook did and said, You know what?

45
00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.430
Anthony Taylor: Here's the whole trained model. Do with it what you will.

46
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:59.610
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and in I will try to get some of that in here, because it's such a cool one to use. And and it's really good. I mean, like, really good.

47
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:09.660
Anthony Taylor: Okay, is it Openai? Not quite. But it's pretty damp. And there are rating sites that actually rate. Llama 70 B higher

48
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.850
Anthony Taylor: than Openai stuff. Alright. But it's very cool. You can literally download it to your laptop.

49
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.969
Anthony Taylor: It's slow if you do that, but it can be done.

50
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:28.300
Anthony Taylor: But anyway. so yeah. So the Openai stuff allows us to have conversational

51
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.569
Anthony Taylor: AI conversations

52
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.039
Anthony Taylor: that's redundant.

53
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.930
Anthony Taylor: With the Api. It also will generate images.

54
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.680
Code.

55
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.300
Anthony Taylor: All of these things are capabilities of this Api.

56
00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:53.510
Anthony Taylor: So, setting up the Openai account, we kind of talked about that the other day. You just go to the Openai site you select. Api. You sign up, you get a new key.

57
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.979
Anthony Taylor: We'll actually use that key in

58
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.419
Anthony Taylor: python in just a few moments.

59
00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:59.900
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

60
00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:07.650
Anthony Taylor:  so we don't really need to do this for this particular one. We're deep in

61
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.639
Anthony Taylor: python right now, but we will install a new library called Openai.

62
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.269
Anthony Taylor: So you can pip Install Openai while I'm talking. If you'd like.

63
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.020
Anthony Taylor: we will just like we did when we did Apis.

64
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:27.180
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna have like a config, dot pia py file where you'll put your Api key.

65
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.710
Anthony Taylor: Do not put your Api key on. Get up!

66
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:42.179
Anthony Taylor: Do not share it. This key can cost you money if it is used excessive. Alright, keep that in mind.

67
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:52.380
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna create a basic request and talk about a couple of the parameters just 2 prompt and Max tokens.

68
00:06:52.860 --> 00:07:05.399
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna get into exactly what those mean. Just a few moments. We're going to do some text generation. We'll be able to do code, generation language translation, all

69
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.460
Anthony Taylor: with just a few lines of code.

70
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.420
Anthony Taylor: Just a few. You're gonna be blown away by how simple this is!

71
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.629
Anthony Taylor: There are rate limits to keep in mind.

72
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:30.260
Anthony Taylor:  and and that just has to do with how often you call it for the for the sake of this course, we're not going to call it that much. Don't have to worry about it. If you decide to create a app

73
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.549
Anthony Taylor: and app that you intend to use

74
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.549
Anthony Taylor: commercially. You need to be aware that, hey?

75
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.100
Anthony Taylor: There is a limit to how fast you can call it.

76
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.619
Anthony Taylor: And there's usage guidelines.

77
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:47.920
Anthony Taylor: The Api itself will not let you ask inappropriate questions.

78
00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:57.780
Anthony Taylor: however, sometimes inappropriate questions are not as inappropriate as they may sound. Give you a great example, this actually happened the other day.

79
00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.779
Anthony Taylor: I've created this app

80
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:04.810
Anthony Taylor: that creates social stories. Any of you work with special needs at all.

81
00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:11.990
Anthony Taylor: No, okay. So social story is like a story that you tell

82
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:17.160
Anthony Taylor: children typically with special needs or or learning issues.

83
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:25.760
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and it basically kind of feeds them a story about something they're going to be doing soon. or something they've done

84
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.370
Anthony Taylor: right. And it's a way for you to like

85
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:49.849
Anthony Taylor: through a story. Kind of tell them, you know. Hey? That's not something you should do or get ready, you know, next week we're going to Disneyland and look at this little kid in the story. They had all this fun. Okay, anyway, I wrote this on Gbt, that does this whole thing makes these social stories for this special needs. Children. Well.

86
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:54.120
Anthony Taylor: an example was presented to me of a child that was.

87
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.250
Anthony Taylor: It was like a teenage boy, and he had a bad habit of

88
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.580
Anthony Taylor: inappropriate touching of himself during lectures during class.

89
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:11.339
Anthony Taylor: So we wrote a whole suite of years of social need story for how? That's not appropriate private time, etc.

90
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.599
Anthony Taylor: Chat Gp said Noah. wouldn't allow us to do.

91
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:20.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay, just wouldn't allow it, no matter how many your plays. Stated it

92
00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:23.620
Anthony Taylor: wouldn't allow us to do it. Wasn't it appropriate? Absolutely not

93
00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:33.650
Anthony Taylor: was perfectly acceptable use. So there is a method. And this is why I'm telling you this story. There is a method to get a hold of of open AI and tell them, Hey.

94
00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.599
Anthony Taylor: I need to be able to do this to do what I want to do with your product

95
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:44.690
Anthony Taylor: all right, and they will get back to you and say you're good to go, or sorry we can't let that go.

96
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.210
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now, I will also tell you

97
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.999
Anthony Taylor: that there are

98
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:59.310
Anthony Taylor: other libraries that that you can get, not get around. This is the right word, but that, like the llama, it's local.

99
00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:10.680
Anthony Taylor: You can ask anything, I'm thinking. okay. we're not going to get into that cause. You don't need to know how to make bombs and stuff like that look on Youtube. It's really simple

100
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:24.280
Anthony Taylor:  which leads us to responsible AI use as well as potential buyer. Oh, not that responsible AI use is exactly what I said. Yeah, with llama 70 BI can create a chat bot, that is uncensored.

101
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.180
Anthony Taylor: All right. I've done it, tested it pretty damn interesting.

102
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:34.119
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's amazing what they will actually tell you when they go at their block site.

103
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:38.869
Anthony Taylor:  Don't do that. It's I mean, you know.

104
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.030
Anthony Taylor: if you have a good reason to unlock some features

105
00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:46.739
Anthony Taylor: great. But don't unlock it completely. It's it's just not pretty.

106
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.759
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's just my opinion.

107
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:53.679
Anthony Taylor: I'm not going to show you how to do it. You'll have to look that up separately.

108
00:10:54.180 --> 00:11:00.139
Anthony Taylor:  so keeping in mind that these models were all trained off of the Internet.

109
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.300
Anthony Taylor: right? There are certainly

110
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:08.690
Anthony Taylor: potential biases and ethical implications, potential biases

111
00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.020
Anthony Taylor: the Internet is made up of a whole bunch of people.

112
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:17.360
Anthony Taylor: Is it equally distributed across race religion.

113
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:24.100
Anthony Taylor: social norms? No, it's not.

114
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.550
Anthony Taylor: We all know that

115
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:30.899
Anthony Taylor: the way that you deal with this is that you have to understand that.

116
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:41.390
Anthony Taylor: Okay, when you ask questions. If there is a chance that potential bias may be affecting the answer. You need to be aware of it when you use that answer.

117
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:44.660
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's not going to go away.

118
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:46.239
Anthony Taylor: no matter what

119
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:51.739
Anthony Taylor: the only way they could make this go away is to artificially create content.

120
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:53.859
Anthony Taylor: to try to even out

121
00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:57.979
Anthony Taylor: feel that the artificial creative content wouldn't be realistic.

122
00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.190
Anthony Taylor: So it's still biased.

123
00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:14.869
Anthony Taylor: Alright hate that we're gonna talk about that more in class, in the Data Ethics section. Speaking of ethical implications, it's a lot of discussion. Hey? If it read the whole Internet, didn't it pick up some copyrighted material?

124
00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:21.749
Anthony Taylor: Supreme Court has said, if you published it publicly on the Internet, it is not copyrighted

125
00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.699
Anthony Taylor: right? If it's public, it's public

126
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:38.550
Anthony Taylor: period. Now there is some discussions on like trials, and like, well, you're allowed to read 5 articles a month. Then you have to pay stuff like that.

127
00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.190
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so

128
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:44.320
Anthony Taylor: it's there. Be aware, all right.

129
00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:49.680
Anthony Taylor: so yeah, we're good. These are some resources. We'll show you as we go.

130
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.920
Anthony Taylor: Q. And A's later. So

131
00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:58.950
Anthony Taylor: you don't have this code that I'm about to show you. You will. -Oh.

132
00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:06.410
Anthony Taylor: that's interesting.

133
00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.340
Anthony Taylor: I literally just had this open a few minutes ago.

134
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.780
Oh.

135
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:25.670
Anthony Taylor: 1 s. Usually, when this happens, by the way, in your Ps code. make sure there's not an update. You need to install.

136
00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.940
Anthony Taylor: What are you talking about.

137
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:42.110
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Anthony? What was the thing you said that we could go ahead and Pip install right now if we wanted to. Was it just open a I

138
00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:43.550
Anthony Taylor: open AI

139
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.370
Meredith McCanse (she/her): to just pip install Openai.

140
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.450
Anthony Taylor: Yes.

141
00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:50.930
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna show it to you 1 s. That is.

142
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:54.060
Anthony Taylor: I hadn't finished my install, apparently.

143
00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:01.780
Anthony Taylor: Okay, yeah. So Pip, install open AI at the top of your notebook.

144
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:03.810
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

145
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:06.909
if you wanna do this the way I'm doing it.

146
00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:15.739
Anthony Taylor: I created it. I'm not gonna put config wy up on the screen, but it's exactly the way we did it, for you have Api Key equals.

147
00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.860
Anthony Taylor: Put your open a IT in it.

148
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:23.069
Anthony Taylor: Okay, well, never mind. Mine's right there on the screen, so I will

149
00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:27.520
Anthony Taylor: delete that open a I key after class. But anyway, so here it is.

150
00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:35.980
Anthony Taylor:  so just create a config.py. Api key equals. Put your key right there. Okay?

151
00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.270
Masarirambi, Rodney: Sorry. Quick question, do we have this?

152
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:47.239
Anthony Taylor: Not yet. No, this is I. Wanna get this to you after class or after we're done.

153
00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:50.489
Anthony Taylor: Normally, I would. But we'll type. Most of this, in fact.

154
00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:58.020
Anthony Taylor:  I can look at that.

155
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:02.060
Anthony Taylor: Maybe not.

156
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:08.970
Anthony Taylor: I was hoping I could bring it up on another screen.

157
00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.300
Anthony Taylor:  and know what I could do.

158
00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.120
Anthony Taylor: And then we can type through these because we have enough time.

159
00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.490
Anthony Taylor: There's not many lines of code here, so

160
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.939
Anthony Taylor: I guess I can't. Sorry can't do it alright.

161
00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:30.699
Anthony Taylor: So you're gonna Pip, install open AI.

162
00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:38.370
Anthony Taylor: Do not people still lengthain? We're gonna do length chain in a in a different review.

163
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:46.650
Anthony Taylor: Okay. lane chain is amazing. And we will definitely do it. Okay.

164
00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.690
Anthony Taylor: once you've done that,

165
00:15:50.430 --> 00:16:02.230
Anthony Taylor: do from Openai, import Openai from config import your Api key. And this is how we initialize our Api. Yes.

166
00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:09.979
sonja baro: so I'm sorry to be dense. I'm in a Jupiter notebook that I just opened in my Vs code.

167
00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:16.130
sonja baro: And it's asking me what server I'm running against.

168
00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:25.530
Anthony Taylor: am I?

169
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:31.790
sonja baro: Well, if I go python environment, okay? Now, it seems like, maybe it's gotten over itself.

170
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:48.880
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, he was just looking for it. Stuff no worries. Okay. So once, once you import you, you initialize open AI by simply saying, Openai, passing your Api key.

171
00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:50.430
Anthony Taylor: And that's it.

172
00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.879
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you are now connected

173
00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:57.139
Anthony Taylor: to probably the most powerful Lln.

174
00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.730
the planet, at the moment at least, that we have access to.

175
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:02.480
Anthony Taylor: Alright

176
00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:06.840
Anthony Taylor: all we're gonna do, we're gonna we're gonna do

177
00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.349
Anthony Taylor: 2 functions. You really only need one of these.

178
00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:14.629
Anthony Taylor: We're going to do a git response. And this one.

179
00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:23.190
Anthony Taylor: it's simply going. We're, gonna we'll answer a question. We'll get an answer. That's it. Okay, it's using an older model.

180
00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:34.399
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So like it's really inexpensive. If you want to use this model, I wouldn't. Even if you're trying to type right now. Don't even bother typing this on here, I'll fill this up and slap

181
00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.409
Anthony Taylor: for you guys just for your own.

182
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:43.880
Anthony Taylor: It's like everything on the planet just keeps popping up right now.

183
00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:47.910
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna put this in extra reviews. By the way.

184
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.190
Anthony Taylor: think all of you are in this.

185
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:57.030
Anthony Taylor: So that I just put this function in there.

186
00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:05.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so let's talk about what this function does. It says it's called, get response. It's going to accept a parameter called question.

187
00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:13.380
Anthony Taylor: it's gonna print standard request. And then it's gonna execute the completions

188
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.760
Anthony Taylor: module

189
00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.430
of opening up.

190
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:30.800
Anthony Taylor: So one thing a lot of people don't know about llams, is there? Many of them are completion models, which means they look at your question or your statement, and they want to complete it.

191
00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.639
Anthony Taylor: So if you said.

192
00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:41.819
Anthony Taylor: I wanna know the most famous artist in the world? It'll answer the question. But a better prompt is

193
00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:45.349
Anthony Taylor: the most famous artist in the world is.

194
00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:51.129
Anthony Taylor: that's actually what the model is doing in the background.

195
00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:55.710
Anthony Taylor: It's going to reframe your question and do a completion.

196
00:18:57.050 --> 00:19:03.439
Anthony Taylor: So when we wanna do like a chat bot like a chat, Tpp, it's really completions.

197
00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:05.780
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

198
00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:10.059
Anthony Taylor: so we're gonna instantiate this completions method

199
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:16.600
Anthony Taylor: pass in which model we want to use. Unless you are an enterprise or you have

200
00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.310
Anthony Taylor: special permission. You cannot do Gpt. 4 right now.

201
00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:26.269
Anthony Taylor: Okay, the best you can do is 3.5 turbo.

202
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:35.490
Anthony Taylor: It's also the most expensive. By most expensive, I mean, like a dollar per 100,000 tokens.

203
00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.539
Anthony Taylor: which would be a hundred 1,000 words.

204
00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:42.860
Anthony Taylor: I don't think it's that. I think it's pennies. But whatever okay, the message.

205
00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:45.330
Anthony Taylor: this is basically a template

206
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:53.340
Anthony Taylor: which we're gonna get more involved with when we do link chain. But for the moment we're gonna say, Chat, tpt

207
00:19:53.350 --> 00:20:01.819
Anthony Taylor: your role user or the message is going to be from a user. And the content is going to be whatever question we type in

208
00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:07.319
Anthony Taylor: when it's done or when we call this, it's then going to print.

209
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:14.659
Anthony Taylor: The output of this method. which will be in an array. are only interested in the first item.

210
00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:18.029
Anthony Taylor: and it will be the content of the answer.

211
00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:22.160
Anthony Taylor: That's it. Okay, that's the entire

212
00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:26.420
Anthony Taylor: function to make Openai.

213
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.240
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

214
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:34.629
Anthony Taylor:  okay, well, that's that's the that's the single question.

215
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:35.940
Anthony Taylor: Alright

216
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:48.329
Anthony Taylor: to do a stream, and and you'll and and I'll show you the difference to do a stream. Look, everything is the same except at the end. We say stream equals true. And then we say so for chunk in stream.

217
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:55.400
Anthony Taylor: Alright, if not, chop, continue so. In other words, it keeps going. You're gonna understand it just a minute what? That is.

218
00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:56.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

219
00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:09.349
Anthony Taylor: All right. So let's run this guy. So this is gonna run the stream work. So we're going to run this. And at the top of the screen. A box is going to pop up.

220
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:13.210
Anthony Taylor: You may ask this box anything you ask. Chat. Gpd.

221
00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:16.030
Anthony Taylor: so.

222
00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:20.850
Anthony Taylor: me! A haiku!

223
00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.610
Anthony Taylor: Is it a, I can

224
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:24.860
about

225
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:28.200
Anthony Taylor: data science.

226
00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:32.630
Anthony Taylor: Okay, hit enter. and it'll do it.

227
00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:36.509
Anthony Taylor: Now, notice, it's still going.

228
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:40.469
Anthony Taylor: This is the difference between stream and question.

229
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.759
Anthony Taylor: because we're doing stream. It'll just keep asking me and forever.

230
00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.190
Anthony Taylor: what do you wanna do? What do you wanna do until we type in

231
00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:52.449
Anthony Taylor: or exit? Is it end or exit.

232
00:21:56.070 --> 00:22:01.450
Anthony Taylor: believe it's end. or just enter or escape. Escape.

233
00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:06.120
Anthony Taylor:  so yeah. So we could ask it again. We could say,

234
00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:10.670
Anthony Taylor: give me a short wrap on

235
00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.890
Anthony Taylor: cruising or not cruising. That could be the wrong thing.

236
00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.610
Boats

237
00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:25.780
Anthony Taylor: in the style of snew dao. Okay? And it's gonna do it.

238
00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

239
00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:38.799
Anthony Taylor: And that's it. That's the whole thing to end it. It's either escape. Yeah, all you're doing. Oh, no, escape doesn't do it. It's exit, I think.

240
00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:42.099
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Exit will get you out of it.

241
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:44.779
Anthony Taylor: And that's it, guys.

242
00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:50.099
Anthony Taylor: you can now create. Chatbot granted it to text.

243
00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:56.109
Anthony Taylor: You know, we will get to how you can do this in an actual app. At another time.

244
00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:59.450
Anthony Taylor: questions

245
00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:12.399
sonja baro: go ahead. I was just gonna ask conceptually, this is what the other companies have done using an Api call

246
00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:17.850
sonja baro: to expose. And are they doing streaming because it's always available?

247
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:28.170
Anthony Taylor: Well, no, not necessarily, because you can also build into it what we didn't do, and when we do, lang chain will do more of this like this doesn't keep your history

248
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:30.870
Anthony Taylor: like Chat Gpt does.

249
00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:36.960
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But when we do name chain we'll I'll show you how you can actually get it to keep on memory.

250
00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:41.429
Anthony Taylor: and it stops every time, so it'll you'll ask a question. It'll stop.

251
00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:48.760
Anthony Taylor: and then you ask it another question, and it'll use the last question you ask as well as your current question.

252
00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:50.320
sonja baro: wow.

253
00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:54.810
Anthony Taylor: yeah. And yeah, it's it's it is deceptively simple.

254
00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:59.879
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it. I mean to do any of this stuff. But

255
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:15.979
Anthony Taylor: there, there, we this is literally just the first step I love that it's so simple. I mean to be honest with you. I wouldn't even worry about these to get response ones. You could call them. If you want, send it question, you'll get an answer. That's it. One question, one answer.

256
00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:17.690
Anthony Taylor: different models.

257
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:23.469
Anthony Taylor: So if you look in the Openai documentation, you'll notice that there are a lot of models.

258
00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:31.249
Anthony Taylor: There's Davinci, there's Curie, there's Gpt. 3.5, etc. Okay, yes, Meredith, I'm sorry. What was your question?

259
00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:43.229
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Oh, no, it's okay. I can. You scroll back up to what? Ha! What you had at the very top after the import stuff. Okay, thank you.

260
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:49.000
Anthony Taylor: Let me get rid of this guy again. Actually, I'm not gonna get rid of that cause I gotta go delete that key

261
00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.780
Anthony Taylor: because I'm an idiot leaving it on the screen.

262
00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:56.239
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yeah. And then do you

263
00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:02.209
Meredith McCanse (she/her): like? Where would some one use this? Would it just would it be like, sort of a

264
00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:08.890
Meredith McCanse (she/her): someone could access it through a website? So instead of going to chat through your business website.

265
00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:14.030
Anthony Taylor: you could do this. And

266
00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:17.460
Anthony Taylor: it's interesting. What's it doing?

267
00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:22.519
sonja baro:  I have a used case.

268
00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:40.800
sonja baro: and I could share and see if that would qualify and answer Meredith your question like. So when I used to when I worked at American Diabetes Association, we had a 1 800 number if people would call and ask their questions, and the the person answering

269
00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.969
sonja baro: the call is literally reading a script

270
00:25:44.150 --> 00:26:03.600
sonja baro: to answer the questions. And I'm wondering, could we? They create or someone could create a chat bot! That took all of that and made it accessible without necessarily having to have the person and maybe use it as a trade response or a hierarchy, so that we

271
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:10.529
sonja baro: well, that's almost a rules engine. But yeah, but I can tell you. We will get to the point where I'll show you how to import all those docs.

272
00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:15.009
sonja baro: Okay. But is that an example of what?

273
00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:16.250
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

274
00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:20.299
Anthony Taylor: does that satisfy your your question as well?

275
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:24.569
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So I guess I'm just trying to like so would it

276
00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:35.239
Meredith McCanse (she/her): if if it's used in house by someone's team, would it? Would they come into python and use it through python? And what's the benefit of doing it here?

277
00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:39.389
Anthony Taylor: You you have to build the back end to build the front end.

278
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:41.350
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay.

279
00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:45.469
Anthony Taylor: yeah. So we're not building front end yet. I will show you that in another.

280
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:53.799
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but this is just to show you as the Coder how to make all of this work.

281
00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:59.779
Anthony Taylor: I'll show you there. It's like another, like 2 cells of code to make it into

282
00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:00.890
Anthony Taylor: a little gooey.

283
00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:03.350
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay, yeah, it's not that hard.

284
00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.099
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, yes, Mike.

285
00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:14.650
Anthony Taylor: Oh, wait. Sorry. All 3 of those notebooks. Yep. Well, there's not 3. There's only one

286
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.440
Anthony Taylor: just the one you're looking at.

287
00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.640
Anthony Taylor: But yes, Rodney.

288
00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:33.300
Masarirambi, Rodney: this one we might wanna think about like getting a domain that we could use to, you know, to demonstrate this, or, like, you know, maybe a close demonstration kind of thing, or

289
00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:34.500
Anthony Taylor: for what?

290
00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:47.559
Masarirambi, Rodney: Oh, just to show like it was like, say, somebody like checked this out and see like everyone likes somebody to to to run to just like going. And you could totally do this for fun and show somebody. Yeah, II just want you guys understand, this is

291
00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:54.420
Anthony Taylor: as this is the first step in, like maybe 6 steps to get to something like

292
00:27:54.830 --> 00:28:00.969
Anthony Taylor: big like what Meredith was talking about. Well, where would I use this? This is just the engine drive. This is the motor

293
00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:09.580
Anthony Taylor: we haven't even built steering wheel. We haven't built car. We haven't built gas tank. No. this is the motor that drives the yellow lip.

294
00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:13.109
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we will get to all of that

295
00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:18.490
Anthony Taylor: in the coming weeks. But what I want to do is get you guys this. So we'll get you started

296
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:29.779
Masarirambi, Rodney: right? So theoretically, if we have like own domain like this is like something that we could like start in in into the end prepping to show as like a demo.

297
00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:34.939
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I'm not gonna get. I mean, like I, if we were in my data science, when we actually teach enough

298
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:43.890
Anthony Taylor: Javascript and HTML, that you could do this in there and make like a full blown web page. We're not going to probably do that here. There are other ways to do it without

299
00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:45.520
Anthony Taylor: Javascript and H. 2,

300
00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:53.699
Anthony Taylor: anyway. so I'd like to wrap up? Are there any last one last question anybody got one?

301
00:28:56.770 --> 00:29:01.200
Derek Rikke: Yeah. Can we pass in like a data frame or load?

302
00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:07.619
Derek Rikke: Just you'd have to do it as a loop. So if you wanted to do that

303
00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:12.429
Anthony Taylor: like, maybe like this one, you wanted to get an answer for multiple questions.

304
00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:15.270
Anthony Taylor: So you pass in a data frame with questions

305
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:18.300
Anthony Taylor: you could absolutely use, apply

306
00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:24.549
Anthony Taylor: and call this function passing question. Now, if you wanted to pass in data to embed it

307
00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:28.230
Anthony Taylor: to answer questions. That's a lesson down the road.

308
00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:33.540
Derek Rikke: Okay, but we're getting cool. Yeah, we'll get there.

309
00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.290
Anthony Taylor: I gained

310
00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:41.410
Meredith McCanse (she/her): great. Can you scroll down just a little bit. Yes. just right there. Yeah. Oops that

311
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:46.930
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I was looking for the lab. Yeah, the defined.

312
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:52.690
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I mean, I'm gonna give you the whole notebook. But here.

313
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:55.560
Anthony Taylor: yeah, that's right. I only gave you the first one.

314
00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:02.399
Anthony Taylor: Here's the second function. And then here's a quote.

315
00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.650
Anthony Taylor: But again, I'm gonna give you guys

316
00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.829
Anthony Taylor: the whole thing. So don't worry.

317
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.809
Anthony Taylor: anyway. Alright stopping.
