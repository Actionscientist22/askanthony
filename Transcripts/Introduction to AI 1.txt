00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:30.260
Gabriela Manis: awesome. Thank you. I forgot off Co. Host. Thank you. Alright. So I hope everybody I know this is general, but we did have an intro channel in slack. You haven't done that yet, and you want to do that. Please take an opportunity. Take some time to do that. So that way we can get to know all of our students. My name is Gabriel Mannis. I am actually not the student success advisor for your class. I am going to be introducing Nick.

3
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:54.719
Gabriela Manis: who will be here either later this evening or later this week. He's gonna be your support person. I have been a student success manager for a very long time, and I am now an academic manager. So you're not gonna see? Well, me a lot. I'm in the background, but Nick is here to support you, and then I do want to also give an opportunity to Kathy Wilson, who is here joining us tonight for your day. One Kathy.

4
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:11.409
Cathie Wilson: I think so much as Gabrielle mentioned. My name is Kathy Wilson. I'm the academic director for the information and communications technology program at do use University College. I'm so excited to be here with all of you tonight as you begin your boot camp journey

5
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:34.349
Cathie Wilson: as a AI is going to equally disrupt and reshape almost every industry sector in the coming years. So while there's so much talk about the AI and its impact. And you know, to to weed through all of that and allow this bookcamp to to allow you to focus on the technology, the analysis and the solutions around the effective use of AI technologies.

6
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:47.329
Cathie Wilson: It's just amazing what you're about to experience. I feel that having the necessary skills to really interpret and engage with a technologies will be crucial going forward. I'm excited that you've all chosen to embark on this journey

7
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.829
Cathie Wilson: at Dews University College. The ICT program contains master's and certificate programs and 9 different concentrations.

8
00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:20.610
Cathie Wilson: And so we're we're a large program, and we feel privileged to partner with to you to be able to offer boot camps via our center for professional development. So what I really want you to know today is that as of today.

Cathie Wilson: but I wish you all the best of luck, and hope that you thoroughly enjoy the experience.

10
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:52.190
Gabriela Manis: Thank you so much, Kathy. So now let me tell you all a little bit about Nick. Now, I don't have his fun facts here on this slide today day, but he is going to be your support person throughout the entire boot cap. So if you're feeling stressed, you're feeling overwhelmed. You need help with your schedule. You want to talk about just your success plan and the resources that we have available. He can help you with all of that. And that is his role. Now.

11
00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:08.819
Gabriela Manis: curriculum stuff. Oh, he knows a little bit about AI. We're not subject matter. Experts. We are support matter experts. So that's what we're here for. So that is Nick's role. You can message him anytime at N. Kenger at Bootcamspotcom or find him on Linkedin. But he'll be in class this week.

12
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:24.159
Gabriela Manis: all of the support emails, the mailers that you're going to be getting on a weekly basis. You might have already gotten one from him for week. One just reviews what you're going to be going over that week. You can always hit reply on one of those. And also when you create tickets in Bootown spot, which I'll talk a little bit about later.

13
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:35.959
Gabriela Manis: Those do get usually redirected to him. And let's say you're going to an appropriate department like student accounts, or something like that. So he is your support person who is kind of holding your hand throughout boot camp. Alright.

14
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.129
Gabriela Manis: Now let's meet your instructional team.

15
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.929
Gabriela Manis: I'm gonna pass it over to Kevin, one of your teaching assistants. Kevin.

22
00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:21.549
Kevin Nguyen: or the market.

23
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.090
Kevin Nguyen: and I've worked with Anthony for maybe 5 cohort 6 covid. So far

24
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.169
Gabriela Manis: awesome. Thank you, Kevin. Pass it over to James.

25
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.209
James Torres: Hey, guys, so a little bit about me, this is going to be my

26
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:49.520
James Torres: fourth cohort. I worked with data analytics for 3 of them. I'm also a product of a of this type of model. So I was able to get a job right out of out of something like this

27
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:59.410
James Torres: a little bit about what I'm doing now. I work at Embassy universal so I work with ad analytics for Peacock. So that data visualization, and so on and so forth

28
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:23.019
James Torres: fun back about me. It's kind of fitting that I work for peacock cause I love. Really, Campy horror movies the checky series is my is my favorite. They are peacock. Yes, I mean, and I'm a big board game guy. So enjoy dungeon dragons and so forth. So, yeah, definitely ask me about either of those. I'm very chatty about it. And if you have any other questions you know about life or anything like that. Just let me know.

29
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.769
Gabriela Manis: all right. And finally, Anthony

30
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.949
Anthony Taylor: can't tell. That's also a picture from the same crews.

31
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:46.180
Anthony Taylor: anyway. So yeah, I've been doing data. My story's great. You will hear it. I guarantee it, even if you don't. Wanna you're gonna hear it at some point

32
00:05:46.430 --> 00:06:01.890
Anthony Taylor: 30 years in data and data science. The last 10 or 15 of those were focused on large scale cloud implementations. I actually own the domain. Cloud Guide tech don't go to it. There's nothing there.

33
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:08.159
Anthony Taylor: I just like to have the vanity email. I'm kind of fun that way. But

34
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.210
Anthony Taylor: yeah. So been doing this a long time.

35
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:24.850
Anthony Taylor: As a director of Cloud analytics at Ntt, data ntt, may sound familiar. It sounds kind of like Atp, because Ntt is Nippon Telegraph and telecom. So it's really big. Just not so much the Us.

36
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.829
Anthony Taylor: And currently principal developer company called Arthrex in Florida.

37
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.929
Anthony Taylor: I currently live in San Antonio.

38
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.440
Anthony Taylor: So I've taught

39
00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:47.549
Anthony Taylor: 8 cohorts at University of California, Irvine, because that's where I lived when I started all of this, and in after Co. After the whole covid thing.

40
00:06:47.880 --> 00:07:01.679
Anthony Taylor: II moved to San Antonio like, why not right? And I kept teaching in Irvine, and I kept working in Florida. So I'm always on all. Now I work at mountain. So this is crazy. This is crazy time zone switching.

41
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:11.199
Anthony Taylor:  yeah, you're gonna hear lots about my fun facts. I met very interesting background.  probably you didn't say it right now, but

42
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:22.100
Anthony Taylor: I observed some of my earlier my degree. I know you're all expecting some crazy computer science degree. No, it's in nursing. I was actually a nurse when I started

43
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:38.669
Anthony Taylor: and from nursing I went into video games. From video games I went into data, and from then I spent probably 20 of my 30 years working in data specifically for the healthcare industry.

44
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.940
Anthony Taylor: So the nursing degree helped.

45
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.849
Anthony Taylor: So anyway, yeah, I have lots of dogs. They show up

46
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.139
Anthony Taylor: every so often.

47
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.359
Anthony Taylor: That's it, for now you'll hear more

48
00:07:51.300 --> 00:08:03.440
Gabriela Manis: awesome. Thank you. And if you all do hear my dogs barking in the background and then set off Anthony's dogs. I apologize. Sometimes they just wanna hang out and say, hello and see why mom's still online.

49
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:26.100
Gabriela Manis: So let's talk a little bit about using zoom and slack. I know you all are here, and you probably already know how to use it. But oh, I lost my mouse there it is. Okay. So in Boot camp Spot. When you log in. Now, you did find class today. So I'm assuming that you know where this is. But just really quick as a quick review on the left side, you should have a little menu. Now this is in Boot Camp. When you first log in, then you have the Pre. Work in the bootcamp.

50
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:44.730
Gabriela Manis: Click in that boot camp, and you should be able to see this menu over here where you can track your grades, your attendance. You can open tickets from the student support section, those will go to the appropriate department. Oftentimes it is Nick who is going to be your student success person. If you have an issue with the grade or anything like that, then you can put those

51
00:08:44.730 --> 00:09:09.590
Gabriela Manis: in there or email him directly. If you need to see your billing career services. Any of those resources are here now your cloud recordings. Of course you might have noticed that this class is being recorded. You can always go back, would you say, just go back and review a lot of the material that you are watching, because a lot of material in a short amount of time, I like to say, an inch deep and a mile wide, so here you can go and look at your cloud recordings that are published.

52
00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:47.979
Gabriela Manis: and you can join classroom here or from the calendar, so you can always go back and say, Hey, I really wanna review that class again and go back and watch it, and double time. Keep yourself on mute, of course, as we all have, maybe kids or dogs and whatnot in the background unless you're talking or you're in breakout rooms. We wanna make sure that you are collaborating and keep yourself on camera. Now, I say, we are adults. If you need to let dogout or grab a class water. That's fine. But if you are off camera for more than 5 min, we're gonna mark your absent cause. We don't know that you are here and present and paying attention. So we do. Wanna make sure that camera is on and you stay mute

53
00:09:47.980 --> 00:10:08.069
Gabriela Manis: muted, if you like privacy. If you see, I have this wonderful, beautiful bookshelf that I built myself just kidding. It's a background on Zoom. But it's really helpful. When you got dogs and everything in the background if you want to do privacy. Okay? So cameras on and stay muted. Now, you will ask. Be asked occasionally to share your screen.

54
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:30.209
Gabriela Manis: Especially when troubleshooting your tas might say, Hey, I need to see that, just so I can help you out a little bit better. So let's make sure that we are on the device that we are watching class on so that we are able to share your screen, and that you're working on. And watch those tabs, you know. Keep your Amazon shopping in a different window or something. Okay?

55
00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:41.380
Gabriela Manis: let's see. That's how to share your screen. Now in slack our communication tool where most of our communication is going to be happening. You do have several different

56
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:57.860
Gabriela Manis: sections over here. You have your live class and things that are going out as class going on resources that your Tas will send out a general Channel random channel for fun gifts. AI related, and classroom related, of course, and then you do have something called. Ask Vcs learning assistant.

57
00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:19.759
Gabriela Manis: The learning assistant does have tas and tutors and learning assistance on the other side, that if you are ever working on your homework, and you don't have a tutoring session till Sunday, and you don't have class till Monday, and you're trying to knock this out on Saturday evening. Well, there are learning assistance here that you can go to if you get tired of Googling, and you can ask for some direction on, so they can help you out with homework and other items.

58
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:31.740
Gabriela Manis: So there will be a how to on that that comes out to you as well, and I think there might already be one in Boot Camp Spot when you log in, but just wanted to bring that to your attention as well.

59
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:48.550
Gabriela Manis: Now, using Bootcamp spot, your learning management system. What are you gonna be using it for? View, course, content and activities? Now, this is also going to be uploaded into Git lab. So both Bootcamp spot and get Lab, you can find your slides in your recordings. You'll have to go to Bootcamp spot for

60
00:11:48.930 --> 00:12:09.140
Gabriela Manis: access challenges and submit homework. This is where you will actually submit all of your work. And at the very end of the boot camp the system reads, hey? Did this person submit everything? And what are their grids and checks that off and flips you over to graduated? So make sure you are submitting everything. Don't say well, I haven't done, but I haven't submitted it yet. Nope, we need to submit it. Okay.

61
00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:38.169
Gabriela Manis: access zoom and recorded classes. I showed you where to do that view. Attendance and grades. Please monitor your attendance. If you are off camera for too long, we mark you absent. You wanna make sure that you aren't missing too many classes. And also, if you have an emergency doctor's appointment, something like that 6 30 at night, who knows? But if you have an emergency, need an excuse absence, and you could talk to Nick about that. Your student success advisor, and just monitor that make sure that you are on track for graduation and then

62
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:52.770
Gabriela Manis: connect with career services. So there's a lot of career services, tools in there as well. I'll talk about in just a second. This is an overview again of that over here on the left side. If you don't have this menu, you click these 3 lines, and this menu will pop out so you can access all of these tools.

63
00:12:52.840 --> 00:13:03.920
Gabriela Manis: Your module, of course, will be here, and then your homework and your challenge. Assignments will be here as well with instructions, and that's where you will submit it. We'll click next

64
00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:27.060
Gabriela Manis: career services. Some of you might be here for career services, a career pivot, or you are just interested in our lifelong learner, and you want to be up your as may a little bit take advantage of these resources. You paid for them. They're part of the program. Use them. They have great workshops great events, a lot of networking opportunities. So this first week, while it's kind of light and you don't have a ton of homework to do

65
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:35.649
Gabriela Manis: log in. Check it out. See what workshops are available, but you can attend to see what resources are available there. Take advantage of those resources. Okay.

66
00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:44.990
Gabriela Manis: Now, the importance of pre work. Some of you might have already logged in, or maybe you just enrolled, and you didn't complete your pre work.

67
00:13:45.240 --> 00:14:10.220
Gabriela Manis: I do wanna bring this to your attention Pre. Work sets you up for success. Now again, when you log in a boot camp spot you have 2 different squares. Once it's pre work. One says Boot camp when you log into pre work anything that you do in there. It's not gonna affect your grade at the end of the boot camp, but it is going to set you up for success. It'll tell you what to download. It'll tell you some reading to do and just reviewing on those items. So if you haven't done your pre work yet, please go back and do that. It's just meant to help you set up.

68
00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:22.870
Gabriela Manis: Set you up for success. You're not gonna have any homework for a couple of days to. So do that. Now start exploring online. See what resources that you have. I really want to make sure that you know everything that is available to you this first week

69
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:27.599
Gabriela Manis: within the job period. Now, boot camp requirements

70
00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:53.940
Gabriela Manis: how to be successful in this boot camp. So, Fyi, you have your schedule. Your Monday, Wednesday, Thursday instructor led class, and then you have office hours before and after. If you notice in your calendar. There's no office hours that are listed there, because it's in the same room. So whenever you go to join class and says starts at 6, 30, join at 45 min before, and hang out 30 min after with us. So that way, you know, you can

71
00:14:53.970 --> 00:15:20.889
Gabriela Manis: pay attention. Be here for any questions that you need. Your tas will help run office hours. You might go into breakout rooms if you're like, Hey, I'm really. I need some help with this homework assignment, or I didn't understand this concept from last class office hours is a great time for that, because there's so much jam packed into the structured class time. So again, Link, that is on boot camp spot. But just before and after all, right? So basically, when we're not recording.

72
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:28.839
Gabriela Manis: I do see some chats, but I'm gonna read them, after all, cause I know that. There, that might take me down a rabbit hole. Okay.

73
00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:41.639
Gabriela Manis: now, minimum completion requirements to actually earn the certificate. So showing up as we're gonna get you the certificate. You gotta do the work. Miss. No more than 4 classes. You do have to show up if you

74
00:15:41.650 --> 00:16:03.219
Gabriela Manis: have emergencies again, please connect with Nick. He can. Me. We can't excuse absences, you know. Hopefully, you don't have an emergency or anything, but we can't excuse some absences and absences can be made up with Nick. So please connect with your Ssa. If you have any questions, anything coming up or anything that you're worried about. But other than extenuating circumstances.

75
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:16.480
Gabriela Manis: you really need to be here for most of the class, because there's so much content, which is why it's so few absences. If you don't feel like you can meet, that requirement might not be the class for you. We wanna make sure that you are successful in this class

76
00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:22.929
Gabriela Manis: now have no more than 2 incomplete or unsubted homework assignments by incomplete or unsubmitted.

77
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:47.889
Gabriela Manis: What that means is anything that is a 0 have no more than 2 zeros. Now you can earn a low grade on something. We don't encourage it because we do have a score minimum in here, but you can get a low grade in this class er or not in this class in an assignment, and continue moving forward and have an overall average of 62, or higher, and you can still graduate. But you cannot have more than 2 zeros. So let's say, you have a 70%.

78
00:16:47.920 --> 00:17:03.910
Gabriela Manis: You have 3 zeros. You're not going to be able to graduate. And the reason for that is we wanna make sure that you are actually completing the modules and the homework and learning every piece, every module in this boot camp. Okay, so no more than 2 of those zeros. Now

79
00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:22.620
Gabriela Manis: participate in all projects, so projects cannot be part of those. Zeros. Say that again, projects cannot be one of those zeros. You do have to participate in all projects. And if you are in a group you must contribute to that group project. We're all adults. We're all here to learn. We wanna help each other, learn. So make sure that you are doing your part

80
00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:30.829
Gabriela Manis: and have your balance painting full at the end of the bootcamp. So again, to actually earn certificate. These are your minimum completion requirements.

81
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:55.510
Gabriela Manis: and you all are. Gonna get a copy of this afterwards. Now, Bocamp code of conduct when you signed up for the class. You did sign the enrollment agreement and agreement to adhere to the university code of conduct that includes everything from bullying sexual harassment, plagiarism just overall being appropriate in the classroom. We're here to support each other. We're here to learn. We're here to be adults, and we're all here to just collaborate

82
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:59.110
and learn from one another. We all bring something to the classroom. So

83
00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:13.640
Gabriela Manis: please make sure that you do review the university code of conduct. Plagiarism is one of the things that I really like to highlight in that. And then I do wanna also mention that this does apply to the classroom environment, including in slack. So

84
00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:37.690
Gabriela Manis: please make sure that we're being school appropriate in slack. We wanna have fun. We wanna learn you can throw some gifts in there and memes, and we'll we will have a lot of fun with one another. But we do want to make sure that everybody feels safe in this learning environment, and if we find that somebody is not conducting themselves appropriately, you can lose access to slack which would overall hurt just being able to communicate with your peers. So we don't wanna end up there alright.

85
00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:50.690
Gabriela Manis: When I move forward support strategies. We watch your class videos go back, watch those recordings just a little tip. I've heard of students saying that they're trying to type things out, and it's going too fast, and they can't keep up.

86
00:18:51.160 --> 00:19:00.049
Gabriela Manis: If you have an important piece that you want to come back to and review when you're looking at things, write down the time that it happened, or like the minutes on the recording that way you can go back to that

87
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.730
Gabriela Manis: point and say, review this at

88
00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:14.170
Gabriela Manis: 1 h and 15 min. So just little tip there, go back and rewatch this class videos. But if you're thinking right now, like, Oh, I'm gonna sit here for 3 h, and then I'm gonna have to re-watch it again tomorrow.

89
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:41.040
Gabriela Manis: Write those times down those timestamps for yourself. That's just a quick little tip tutoring and slack. So your ask Pcs is available on slack that I mentioned, and then you also have tutoring available to you. You're going to have, I think, right now it's just one per week. But it's going to be a bigger session that you'll be able to use at any point. So if you have a week off, then you'll be able to use that extra week later on. So just an Fyi, make sure that you are using tutoring.

90
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:46.069
Gabriela Manis: and I will have Nick send out all that information about how to schedule a tutor if you don't already have that

91
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:52.560
Gabriela Manis: attend office hours come to office hours. No, they're not required. No, they don't count towards your attendance. But

92
00:19:52.580 --> 00:20:15.139
Gabriela Manis: those students who come to office hours and ask questions and ask what you think. The dumb questions are all of the things. Come, don't be shy. We're here to learn. We're here to support you. This is a unique program. This is a traditional education. Ask questions. I'm an office hours talk to us. We can't help you if we don't know, you need help. Alright. Study groups. Some of the most successful students I have seen have

93
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:38.759
Gabriela Manis: then just networking in class. You're networking here with your peers and starting those city groups here, and later on down the line. Someone might be able to recommend you for a role. So start networking and start those city groups here with one another schedule time with your Ssa. You might be thinking, how can Nick help me like I'm an adult. I'm an adult in this class. Ask for help. Come, talk to us. Tell us if you just wanna have

94
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:52.700
Gabriela Manis: coffee and put yourself on his calendar link. He can help you with a schedule. He can help you with steady skills. You can see where you you're struggling. We have seen it all in these boot camps. Trust me, just talk to your Ssa. And make sure that you are using those resources.

95
00:20:53.970 --> 00:21:10.050
Gabriela Manis: Last thing to drop the class. If you feel that you can't meet the requirements of this program and you don't have the time to study for this program. We usually say about 20 HA week, just because it's so much content. And you're gonna be going down your own rabbit holes outside of class.

96
00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:28.790
Gabriela Manis: The last day you drop the class is October 30. No questions asked. Just let us know. If you do pass this class now, the only way to get out of the class is extenuating circumstances. Of course, we hope that nothing like that happens. But you are responsible 100% for the tuition. So if you decide in this first week

97
00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:35.250
Gabriela Manis: that this is not for you, let Nick know we can process that. That's not a problem.

98
00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:40.199
Gabriela Manis: I do wanna mention. Oh, I just lost it. Oh, I just lost it.

99
00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:42.140
Gabriela Manis: darn! It'll come back to me.

100
00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:46.100
Gabriela Manis: So 100% intuition after October thirtieth

101
00:21:46.260 --> 00:22:14.509
Gabriela Manis: this first week is not reflective of how fast it's going to be this first week is the first week. Spend your time looking for services. Look at those resources, steady on your own stimulate, having 20 h of study time that you need to do outside of class. So you know what you're signing yourself up for for the next 24 weeks, or 23 weeks after that. I don't. I've heard from students before, you know. I heard 20 h, and I didn't believe it. And

102
00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:36.669
Gabriela Manis: sure enough, there was 20 h. Anthony, I'm sure you've heard that, too. Right? Yeah. So simulate 20 HA week this week, and see if you're really ready for this, and if you are, we are here to support you. But this first week is definitely the time to do that. Start looking at your resources, see what's available to you and see what it's gonna look like. So that way you're you're ready. You're ready to continue

103
00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:43.630
Gabriela Manis: review some important top top topics add drop date is next Monday, 7 days from today.

104
00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:52.150
Gabriela Manis: the minimum requirements for graduation, 62% grade or higher. This is again recorded and will be sent out.

105
00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:55.979
Gabriela Manis: miss, no more than 2 challenges, no more than 2 zeros.

106
00:22:56.270 --> 00:23:02.189
Gabriela Manis: complete all projects, and no more than 4 classes, and of course, pay your tuition.

107
00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:17.449
Gabriela Manis: Watch out for plagiarism. Now I'm gonna leave this one up to Anthony to tell you a little bit more about, because plagiarism is very unique in this class. And we're gonna tell you, Google, this Google that find this. And you're gonna find things out there online that might help you. And we want you to learn. But if you don't learn.

108
00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:32.749
Gabriela Manis: I mean you're only cheating yourself. You're not gonna be able to go work in this field. So we wanna make sure that you are learning, and that you're not quite plagiarizing anything. And there is a possibility of if you do plagiarize it being 5 with the central grading team. So Fyi, don't put yourself in that position.

109
00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:38.810
Gabriela Manis: And please refer to the syllabus for further information about the program and the units that you're going to be going over

110
00:23:39.390 --> 00:24:08.829
Gabriela Manis: Nick did say, Key, I cannot help you if I don't know what's going on. Be proactive and communicate early. Please communicate early. Nick is great. He I've been working with him for over a year. He took over of University for me as a student success advisor previously. He is great. Talk to him. Use your resources. We are here to support you, but it's a tough program, and we're not gonna hide you about that. It's tough program. We want you to be successful. Okay, oops

111
00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:09.830
Gabriela Manis: next?

112
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.350
Gabriela Manis: Oh, no. What did I do?

113
00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:14.790
Gabriela Manis: I think that's it.

114
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:18.740
Anthony Taylor: Let's get started. That's great. Any questions.

115
00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:27.679
Anthony Taylor: The one in chat was answered by a students who work. They already are on the right track. Look at that!

116
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:32.130
Gabriela Manis: Oh, I got one more question, one more. Oh, sorry.

117
00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:35.459
Gabriela Manis: Go for it. Let me do the question, and then I'll I'll

118
00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:57.639
Gabriela Manis: okay. Can you hear me? Yes, I was having some microphone problems earlier. Question about the recordings when you save the recordings, do you save the transcript and make that available to it's automatically recorded with the trial. So when you go into zoom, the transcript will show up on the right side.

119
00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:15.450
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay, cause it can also be made available as a separate document, and you can control F. So if you know you were talking about a certain topic, you can find it, and then it'll give you a timestamp, so you can get quickly to where you want to hear that part again. Switch can be a great tool. That's a great tip, thank you.

120
00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:23.949
Meredith McCanse (she/her): But I don't know if that I think you might have to hit save you might have to explicitly hit save transcript to generate that document. I don't know if that's

121
00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:27.940
Meredith McCanse (she/her): and whoever is, whoever puts out there.

122
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:42.100
Anthony Taylor: I don't know if somebody in the class is turning it on, or I think the Transcript is meant to already turn on. But I don't know when you publish it, Anthony. If if you can download, they do restrict you guys from download.

123
00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:51.349
Anthony Taylor: so I don't know if you'll be able to doubt, but you can. Probably we can open it up and search it within the browser. So they get the time. The timestamp.

124
00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:52.859
Anthony Taylor: It's it's

125
00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:57.379
Anthony Taylor: yeah, it. It's not as hard as you might think to find where we left off, because

126
00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:01.910
Anthony Taylor: the slides and stuff are pretty obvious, and they're usually on screen. So.

127
00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:06.740
Anthony Taylor: but it's still a better way to do it. Efficiency is fantastic.

128
00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:09.100
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yeah. thank you.

129
00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.550
Anthony Taylor: Huh!

130
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:13.460
Anthony Taylor: Was there another question?

131
00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:42.139
Gabriela Manis: That was it. But I didn't want to say one more thing because I did not mention this earlier. If everyone can make sure today that your name is the name that we have in our system. Now, if you have a preferred name, that's perfectly fine, we are happy to honor that, but we do want to make sure that we do mark you present today. So if you have just your first name, or if you're sharing computer with someone, if you can hit those 3 little dots in the top right of

132
00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:49.229
your picture and hit rename. We just want lock first, last name, so our tas can take attendance. Actually, this isn't a huge class. So

133
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:54.049
Gabriela Manis: it should be okay. But just for this first day, if we could do that, please and thank you.

134
00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:59.299
Gabriela Manis: And if there are no other questions.

135
00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:11.680
Gabriela Manis: I'm gonna hand it back to Anthony. I told you, Anthony, I told you I do. 30 min. I'm amazing. You nailed it. That's fantastic. I'm gonna call Jeff, and just go 30 min.

136
00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:13.980
Feel that.

137
00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.100
Anthony Taylor: anyway.

138
00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:19.520
Anthony Taylor: Awesome, awesome. Well, thank you. Well, welcome, everybody.

139
00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:21.930
Anthony Taylor: Are you gonna hang with us for a bit, Gabriel.

140
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.760
Gabriela Manis: just for a minute. Is that the plan cool?

141
00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:29.079
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So here's what we're gonna do. We? We gotta get to know each other

142
00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:33.419
Anthony Taylor: today today is we're going to talk about Aiya Brahmas.

143
00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.330
Anthony Taylor: Okay,

144
00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:46.539
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna get into some conversations today, mostly. Alright. But right now I want to hear a little bit more about each and every one of you nice small class we're actually gonna have.

145
00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:59.750
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, sometimes we'll put you in the breakouts. Talk to each other 3 people, but not we got, you know, not very many people. So we could get through it. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna call you out because you're in a certain order on my screen that we don't miss anybody.

146
00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.610
Anthony Taylor: And

147
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:05.799
Anthony Taylor: I just, you know, 15 s. Who are you?

148
00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:10.249
Anthony Taylor: Something cool about you. Why, you're here. How's that sound

149
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:16.730
Anthony Taylor: good? Everybody can handle that alright. So first on my screen after me right now is Natalie Jason.

150
00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:43.860
Natalie Mason: Hi, everyone! Natalie Mason. I just moved to Denver in June. Fun! Fact about me. I was actually pursuing a career as a boat captain, and I had an e-bike accident and have typically disabled myself. So I just I was in Chicago when I did that I came to Colorado, decided to enroll into this program.

151
00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:57.420
Natalie Mason: and I'm also a musician and a lifer of health care. My dad was a doctor. I helped run our practice for 20 plus years and I have retired out of healthcare.

152
00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:06.380
Natalie Mason: still planning on doing the voting thing. But so many other ventures have opened up with music and I have a friend that is up

153
00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:23.950
Natalie Mason: in AI that has been planting the idea in my head for months to join AI. Join AI program. And so here I am. I'm not really sure which direction I want to go in the career path yet. But I'm excited to learn what's available.

154
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:27.510
Anthony Taylor: Awesome. Thank you. Wow!

155
00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:30.670
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Cindy.

156
00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:35.110
Anthony Taylor: she hangs out. Did I say it? Right? She hangs out. But, Cindy.

157
00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:39.190
Sihong Zhou: yes, easier. You could change it to safety. Going forward.

158
00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:49.490
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. After this class I'll change it, cause it's easier for you to pronounce. Don't do it for me. If that's what you want, I'll go with your

159
00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:53.640
Sihong Zhou: it's for everybody. So like

160
00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:55.440
I

161
00:29:55.460 --> 00:30:21.099
Sihong Zhou: II have been in Denver for like 11 years almost. And I just creating my last job. And my last job. I worked there for 18 years, and it's kind of like a system enemy. And we work on our Erp system. And we maintain the system. And because I used to

162
00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:36.579
Sihong Zhou: have some coding coding, I learning the Java before. So like I, after quitting my job, I just considering to find another job which is related to

163
00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:54.470
Sihong Zhou: related to it, and IA lot of friends. They they just told me Bootcab is a really good option for you to find that desired job. And there's 2 options for me, like AI and cyber security.

164
00:30:54.970 --> 00:31:19.760
Sihong Zhou: And after consideration, I think AI is more suitable for me, and I'm very curious to learning it, and it's very popular. That's why I come here and join this class. And hopefully in the future. I can find a a job in this industry, and we can work together as a colleague.

165
00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.030
Sihong Zhou: Yeah.

166
00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.850
Anthony Taylor: that's fantastic. Good job.

167
00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:31.260
Anthony Taylor: And Java is gonna help you a lot. Java is gonna help you a lot through at least the next 8 weeks.

168
00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:32.900
Sihong Zhou: So that's cool.

169
00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:34.190
Sihong Zhou: Yeah.

170
00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:40.059

173
00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:07.990
Mckimmy, Brandon: and as well. I'm actually using AI tools in my job currently, but not on the coding side yet. And I thought this class would help me try to

174
00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:18.459
Mckimmy, Brandon: get that create a change is something where I can really grasp the contact of Java Python or anything moving forward. That's definitely for the growing industry in the future.

175
00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:27.690
Mckimmy, Brandon: and just looking for any clear change of longevity, and something challenging with anything that can benefit from my future.

176
00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:31.859
Anthony Taylor: Fantastic. Thank you, Brandon. That's good.

Kanouff, Christine: Hi! So can you hear me? I was having trouble earlier. I can hear you automatically now. So I have

180
00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:55.639
Kanouff, Christine: 20 some years in sales and marketing. But I haven't been working in the last 8 years. My kids are just about launching

181
00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:07.509
Kanouff, Christine: so I've been looking. Yeah, I've been looking for something. This class seems really interesting to me on the AI side. My sales and marketing. I was in data analytics

182
00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:16.299
Kanouff, Christine: a long time ago. So, but from a sales side. Hoping this is the right class for me, I got through the pre-work

183
00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:20.710
Kanouff, Christine: by the you know, hanging on by my fingernails. So we'll see

184
00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:32.830
Anthony Taylor: it's a lot easier when someone's explaining it to you, I promise, but no good. Good. Alright.

185
00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:43.990
Clayton Graves: alright! Oh, I'm gonna talk to you guys crazy here in a bit right now I'm keeping it low. Key.

186
00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:46.059
Kanouff, Christine: All right. Jennifer

187
00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:48.690
Anthony Taylor: Dahlgren has there another Jennifer's doing what

188
00:33:48.910 --> 00:34:09.909
Jennifer Dahlgren: it's kind of weird, because almost every time there's another Jennifer, and then I can be like the Jennifer's like a you know. Strange eighties band or something. Jennifer, II actually,

189
00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:21.100
Jennifer Dahlgren: my history has been a lot in in research and quantitative research survey research, administrative like anything I can do to to kind of play around with it. And

190
00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:26.910
Jennifer Dahlgren: lately I've been concentrating on customer experience research. And it's

191
00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:34.420
Jennifer Dahlgren: the job is nice cause I can do everything to set you up. I can ask all you all the questions, but I can't do the analysis, which is kind of what I miss.

192
00:34:34.449 --> 00:34:39.220
So I'm using this as a platform to transfer my abilities to get

193
00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:56.669
Jennifer Dahlgren: back into something that I love. And so I was looking at this class earlier this year and thought, no, no, no! But then I'm like, I just I don't like what I'm doing again. Transformation, trying to do it as a launch pad. All of those good buzz words

194
00:34:56.770 --> 00:35:25.619
Jennifer Dahlgren: that that's me in a nutshell right there. So so yeah, in terms of just AI in general, II kind of like the poor lady that helped me to get into this class like this. Just I know AI is a buzzword. It's like an add eighties bad diet at this point, is it? Gonna actually give me the meat and the potatoes like behind the scenes that I've done in the past. And it's like sure, Jennifer. Yes, and so that's kind of my hope flavor of it

195
00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:34.800
Anthony Taylor: if, of course, she said, that and she and I promise here's what I'll promise you, based on that statement, and this is coming, me

196
00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:38.370
Anthony Taylor: and and and I tell this to all my students on the first date

197
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:42.549
Anthony Taylor: I get paid exactly the same. If there's 2 of you or 50 of you.

198
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:57.599
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so I will be straight with you this week, because this is the only time you get to get out. And I don't want you to get out. Okay. But you are going to learn skills that you will be able to use at a job. And you will learn enough skills that you will be able to

199
00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:13.689
Anthony Taylor: enhance AI models that are already in existence, and we will be using them, of course, but that that is the goal. We're not here to learn how to use chattypt. We're here to learn how to make chat tpt work for us at an organization

200
00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:20.730
Anthony Taylor: so to take something and not necessarily touchy, because Stat is actually an application. Openai is back

201
00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:25.450
Anthony Taylor: right? But we're gonna learn to use these tools and to make them.

202
00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:32.920
Anthony Taylor: Our value to a company will be the fact that we know how to make AI work for that organization.

203
00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:35.110
Anthony Taylor: Okay, technic.

204
00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:42.580
Anthony Taylor: all right. So it's very cool stuff. And so yes, you are going to learn wonderfully marketable skills.

205
00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:51.850
Anthony Taylor: And I'm gonna have so much extra material for you guys, it's gonna you're gonna be like. And yet we only paid for 24 week. Course. Stop it.

206
00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:56.379
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So yeah. Matt. you are up.

207
00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:06.859
Dipinto, Matt: Hi, guys. So I am a technical lead at a company that is doing machine learning and counter uas

208
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:16.089
Dipinto, Matt: and I have no background in software whatsoever. So I am here to hopefully be able to talk intelligently with the team that I'm supposed to know what they're doing.

209
00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:23.710
Dipinto, Matt: I love that that's a great way. Technically, I don't really know what we're doing. But I'm delete. So do what I

210
00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.149
Anthony Taylor: that's cool. I've known last week.

211
00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:36.259
Anthony Taylor: so glad you're here. We're gonna make you the smartest guy in the room, I promise you probably already off, but you just need the fact. Thank you very much.

212
00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:38.050
Anthony Taylor: All right, Clayton.

213
00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:46.229
Anthony Taylor: Your story is inspirational already, just from your picture and your background freaking rocks. It just does.

214
00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.080
Clayton Graves: So

215
00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:51.890
Clayton Graves: I'm in Fort Collins. I'm a

216
00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:58.630
Clayton Graves: Asic Systems Administrator for Hewlett Packard enterprise.

217
00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:04.750
Clayton Graves: We basically make super computers. Like frontiers is is a big one. It's

218
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:08.950
Clayton Graves: was one of the fastest. I don't think it is anymore. But it was one of the fastest

219
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:24.610
Clayton Graves: in the world for for quite a while. Recent cancer survivor. I spent 6 months fighting cancer. Came back to work got laid off, got hired by the same company that laid me off 2 months later.

220
00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:29.300
Clayton Graves: and decided that this would probably be a good time to feature proof my career.

221
00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:37.069
Clayton Graves: and with the job that I'm working now it it seems like it would be a nice dovetail. So

222
00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:43.320
Clayton Graves: I'm looking forward to maybe having that help me understand? Like ansibles built on python, so

223
00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:46.590
Clayton Graves: you know, might help me understand things a little bit better on that front.

224
00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:53.959
Anthony Taylor: Very cool. That's cool. That's some good. You're gonna be. You're gonna be the techie guy in here. I can tell that so far, anyway.

225
00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:57.429
Anthony Taylor: that's cool. Alright, alright, Tanya, you're up.

226
00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:04.320
Excuse me. Hello, everybody! My name's Tanya. and

227
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:09.900
Tania Raugewitz: fun. Fact about me is, I'm let me. I don't know if it's fun. Interesting

228
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:26.020
Tania Raugewitz: is I'm in agriculture, and I developed a plant nutrient slash fertilizer that's being trialed on sugar cane in Florida. One of the reasons I'm kind of segwaying into machine learning. And AI is

229
00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:28.859
Tania Raugewitz: to future-proof my and

230
00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:30.490
Tania Raugewitz: data analytics.

231
00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:39.879
Tania Raugewitz: Although I anticipate and and hope for my entrepreneurial endeavor to succeed. I also do really enjoy data.

232
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:49.510
Tania Raugewitz: and I would like to incorporate AI and kind of the leading edge into nonprofit sectors.

233
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:55.510
Kind of big picture. But in the meantime I would like to also get into a

234
00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:58.489
Tania Raugewitz: as a career, and you know.

235
00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.699
Tania Raugewitz: paying bills, and and

236
00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.670
I call it the Tlr or Tanya Ragu. It's

237
00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:12.789
Tania Raugewitz: reboot career reboot 3. So I've I've rebranded myself several times, and I've always

238
00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:14.620
Tania Raugewitz: enjoy the process

239
00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:21.330
Anthony Taylor: very cool. That's good. that's good. II when you were talking about the

240
00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:29.079
Anthony Taylor: agriculture stuff, I was reminded a a student I had, maybe my third cohort, and and she was a

241
00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:42.259
Anthony Taylor: she had the craziest title, Geographic Hydro Atom. Basically she did water that came from the earth. That's what she studied. and that was it. And I was like. And she like a master group.

242
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:52.969
Anthony Taylor: Now she has a master's in data science, and she's doing some crazy stuff, but it's pretty cool. It was pretty fun, awesome. Well, thank you. Time you're welcome. Derek. You're up.

243
00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:58.479
Derek Rikke: Hi! I'm I'm Derek. I'm in Boulder.

244
00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:00.110
I guess my story.

245
00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:04.460
Derek Rikke: I went to school for aerospace. Wasn't sure about it. Took some time off.

246
00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:17.020
Derek Rikke: Wife adopted our oldest son. Do some extenuating circumstances. Pretty young. and I was like a stay at home, Dad. add a second kid and then

247
00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:26.629
Derek Rikke: did some like warehouse jobs. And actually, I'm just getting divorced earlier this year. So I'm kinda like this big inflection point

248
00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:32.939
Derek Rikke: trying to figure out what I'm doing with my life. And since, like AI, it's like a really cool field, it's gonna like.

249
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.200
Derek Rikke: change the world.

250
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.559
Derek Rikke: Want to try to get a better job, do something cool.

251
00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:41.520
Derek Rikke: something that's gonna change the future.

252
00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:47.819
Anthony Taylor: And then else I can teach you how to make a really cool AI agent that will just talk to you and make you feel better.

253
00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:53.310
Derek Rikke: That that's a fun thing to do. Yeah.

254
00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:57.940
Anthony Taylor: my, my mine like calls me. I ask question.

255
00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:02.649
Anthony Taylor: it's required, and speaks to me as if it was an English royal.

256
00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:06.739
Anthony Taylor: So yeah, it's pretty cool. Alright, Michael.

257
00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:11.760
Anthony Taylor: you're up. Oh, my goodness, pooch. I see your pooch, Michael.

258
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.230
Anthony Taylor: It's like, I hope you're talking about my dog.

259
00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:16.840
Tania Raugewitz: Yeah.

260
00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:21.040
michael mcpherson: aye. you hear me? Hi!

261
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.830
Anthony Taylor: I can hear you wonderfully.

262
00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.350
michael mcpherson: Okay. My name's Mike.

263
00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:36.240
michael mcpherson: I started it with the education and economics and finance. I graduated in 2,007

264
00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:40.909
michael mcpherson: really bad timing. Long story short, I ended up

265
00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:58.479
michael mcpherson: opening phone trucking company. And I've done that for 10 years now. my wife was a stay at home, mom, and she just went back to work in January, and she she said, Well, now, someone's got to stay at home for the summer

266
00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:02.269
michael mcpherson: with kids. And I was like, Okay, I'll come play with them

267
00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:06.339
michael mcpherson: by the end of the summer. I was like. I don't want to do that anymore.

268
00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:10.590
michael mcpherson: So II had to figure out what I wanted to be with her when I grew up.

269
00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:12.849
michael mcpherson: Nope, that's a

270
00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:15.339
michael mcpherson: about what what led me to hear

271
00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:23.369
michael mcpherson:  I am interested do for financial analysis, and

272
00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:26.199
michael mcpherson: all the all the fun things you can do with money.

273
00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:30.339
Anthony Taylor: Oh, yeah. I like that.

274
00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:42.200
Anthony Taylor: So here's the deal. II will tell you this. I've been doing all this stuff for a long time, and I still have grown up. So you don't have to grow up, Michael. Just have fun and do this stuff

275
00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:45.050
Tania Raugewitz: now, next step.

276
00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:53.060
Anthony Taylor: I'm a lot older than that. Let me show you. Okay. So, James, we already talked to Gabriel. You're up, sir.

277
00:43:55.080 --> 00:44:08.619
Vasquez, Gabriel: Yes, my name's Gabriel. I have a 2021 graduate. I was in a a boot camp before this one, which was the coding boot camp.

278
00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:14.390
Vasquez, Gabriel: And I'm transitioning right? II graduated from that boot camp

279
00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:16.050
Vasquez, Gabriel: last October.

280
00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:22.280
Vasquez, Gabriel: And now I'm gonna start doing this AI one. And I also work

281
00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:29.239
Vasquez, Gabriel: as a sortation associate at Amazon, where I just move boxes around.

282
00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:31.630
Vasquez, Gabriel: But

283
00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:42.700
Vasquez, Gabriel: I got I became. I was interested in this class because I wanted to improve my resume, because the even though the coding boot camp was extremely useful.

284
00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.549
Vasquez, Gabriel: it still wasn't enough to

285
00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:50.170
Vasquez, Gabriel: get a foothold in at

286
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:55.429
Vasquez, Gabriel: for job searching, so this will hopefully improve my resume.

287
00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:00.700
Anthony Taylor: Well, I could guarantee that the you took the full stack course.

288
00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:02.390
Yes.

289
00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:06.829
Anthony Taylor: with the node and express and all that stuff. So okay, alright. Well.

290
00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:17.660
Anthony Taylor: I guarantee you, you will increase the value of your resume. And as we go through the course I'm gonna help you

291
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:19.730
Anthony Taylor: make sure you get

292
00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:27.630
Anthony Taylor: good interviews with this this stuff. Okay, that's that's one of my things is I like to help you guys talk you through what you're gonna do

293
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:33.870
Anthony Taylor: and how to get a job. I've had students leave. And I'm not joking the data science class.

294
00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:35.580
And they were like.

295
00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:37.909
Anthony Taylor: in fact, 1 one. My favorite story is.

296
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:45.640
Anthony Taylor: and Christina is in marketing, so she'll know. So I had a student. She was in marketing. Really was not data centric at all.

297
00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:49.200
Anthony Taylor: She took the course very strong in the course.

298
00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:52.250
A week after the course ended

299
00:45:52.320 --> 00:46:03.440
Anthony Taylor: she called me. I was actually at Florida. I was on the the company I work for. They send like this shuttle app. Pick me up, and I was sitting there, she calls, and and and I'm like, what's up and she goes, I have a problem.

300
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:08.000
Anthony Taylor: I go. What's the problem? And she goes. Someone just called me and offered me a hundred 20 K.

301
00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:18.590
Anthony Taylor: And I went. Oh, that's a bad problem to have let me just whatever. And she goes. No, no, you don't get it. I accepted 110 from a different company yesterday. and I went.

302
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:20.300
Anthony Taylor: It's been a week.

303
00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:27.159
Anthony Taylor:  so, anyway. I told her to get the 100 Jen just call him and say, I'm out.

304
00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:34.610
Anthony Taylor: See? Yeah, I said, think of it this way. If someone would have came in and said, they do the job for 100, they would set the same thing to you.

305
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:37.730
Anthony Taylor: So yeah, I mean within a week.

306
00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:46.889
Anthony Taylor: But it was. I'll tell you a lot. Why that worked because you're all gonna get the same skills. I mean, you guys are, gonna get a lot more with the AI stuff.

307
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.350
Anthony Taylor: But it was confident

308
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:59.310
Anthony Taylor: she applied and and kill the interviews. And we're gonna help you do that. Did you do career services in the full stack course?

309
00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:06.090
Vasquez, Gabriel: Yes, I but I also had that previous

310
00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:13.449
Vasquez, Gabriel: advisor before that, when I was in school for technical college.

311
00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:19.969
Anthony Taylor: Nice? Alright, we're gonna get you hooked up, Daniel, I promise alright. Well, okay.

312
00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:26.659
Anthony Taylor: let me make this official so that nobody, I say, I promise, I promise I'll

313
00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:30.699
Anthony Taylor: okay. We can't guarantee anybody's.

314
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:34.110
Anthony Taylor: Everybody does eventually hurry.

315
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:43.409
Curry Gardner: Hi, my name's Curry. I just graduated from Colorado school of minds, studying computer science and electrical engineering.

316
00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:48.250
Curry Gardner: So I mostly focused on like hardware coding.

317
00:47:48.350 --> 00:47:50.329
Curry Gardner: And now

318
00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:53.350
Curry Gardner: I mean over the past year, AI is just

319
00:47:53.490 --> 00:47:58.010
Curry Gardner: blown up, and I mean, just from like a outsider's perspective.

320
00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:04.160
Curry Gardner: And I figured I'd get some technical experience in that as well. Just cause that's

321
00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:06.350
Curry Gardner: looking like where the feature's gonna go.

322
00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:11.269
Anthony Taylor: Excellent, excellent curry, that's good. You make anything cool.

323
00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:23.250
Curry Gardner: You do a lot of Andro Arduino stuff. I love Arduino right here. Yeah, see if it focuses. It's a I see power supply.

324
00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:26.009
Curry Gardner: So or it's just yeah.

325
00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:32.450
Anthony Taylor: yeah, for the Arduino. Nice. That's cool, man. I like II

326
00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.370
Anthony Taylor: I always that's the one thing I wish I would have done at 1 point a couple of times is to do electrical engineering been like

327
00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:45.829
Anthony Taylor: I have, like every kind of micro board you could imagine in another room. Cool? All right, Rodney.

328
00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:52.020
Rodney Simba Masarirambi: Hello! Hi! Hello, everybody.

329
00:48:52.180 --> 00:49:08.300
Rodney Simba Masarirambi: Yeah. My name is Rodney. Simba is my middle name people like to use Simba to refer to me, and you can, too. Don't care I'm originally from Zimbabwe. I had been looking to

330
00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:24.340
Rodney Simba Masarirambi: switch careers, or at least to augment you know and you know, try to better myself. Feature proof myself currently a tech support lead and technical account manager for meeting same. And companies. I know that Jesse works for Nbc.

331
00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:50.929
Rodney Simba Masarirambi: One of our customers. Hi, Jesse, the yeah. So I'm based on actually out of Chicago. The time actually worked best for me to join the Denver cohort. So that's why I'm I'm here. I promise if I make it through the week I'll come out and visit and say, Hello, yeah. So yeah, I've been looking at

332
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:53.640
Rodney Simba Masarirambi: either web development

333
00:49:54.390 --> 00:50:16.039
Rodney Simba Masarirambi: AI or cyber security when I was like trying to make my decision as to where I was gonna go kind of figure that. you know, with the AI side of it I could augment anything, or at least I'm hoping that that's the, and try to be where the Puck's gonna be and you know, try to help shape the future in a way that's

334
00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:22.119
Rodney Simba Masarirambi: diverse and helps everyone rather than just a few. So

335
00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:26.430
Anthony Taylor: I really like that statement be where the Puck's gonna be?

336
00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:28.089
Anthony Taylor: That's a good.

337
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:39.260
Anthony Taylor: It's not mine. Wayne Gretzky. It's not mine. Got it, Wayne. Okay, alright. Alright. Well, thank you.

338
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:42.290
Anthony Taylor: So do you prefer Rodney or Simba, or you truly don't.

339
00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:51.420
Rodney Simba Masarirambi: It's still fine. III have friends who like one, will be referring to me by Rodney. Then I'll be approving my Simba. I will respond

340
00:50:52.040 --> 00:51:02.929
Anthony Taylor: you can. You know what? Just whenever you come back next classes for whatever name you want up there. We call you Bob. It's all up to you. Alright, Meredith! Oh, sorry, thanks.

341
00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:04.050
Anthony Taylor: Meredith.

342
00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:09.520
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Hi! My name's Meredith. I am an accountant

343
00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:18.180
Meredith McCanse (she/her): so I have a Cpa license. I have done some audit things, and then mostly operational accounting, and

344
00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:21.030
Meredith McCanse (she/her): accountants are just buried under

345
00:51:21.330 --> 00:51:37.560
Meredith McCanse (she/her): loads and loads of manual work, and even at fancy tech companies where that, like, I worked at twilio as an accounting manager, and their whole business model is helping companies do things more efficiently. And they're getting into AI and stuff, too, behind the scenes. That doesn't mean their accounting department is

346
00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:49.629
Meredith McCanse (she/her): up to speed, you know, because in house accounting department isn't sexy. It doesn't generate revenue for the company, so oftentimes it's not. It's a little under resourced and overloaded with manual work. So.

347
00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:56.840
Meredith McCanse (she/her): but II think accounting tasks are. They're repetitive, and they are data heavy. And they are.

348
00:51:56.950 --> 00:52:04.210
Meredith McCanse (she/her): for in a lot of ways sort of predictable from month to month. And I think AI is gonna just totally

349
00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:07.120
Meredith McCanse (she/her): change that for your path for everyone.

350
00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:31.880
Meredith McCanse (she/her): And I and I have learned about myself that the thing I get really excited about in accounting is helping to make things more efficient. I learned how to use all tricks at twilio if I don't know if anyone is familiar with all tricks. But it's sort of a low code, easy entry, kind of way to do automation. But you don't have to have a coding background to learn how to use it. And I loved it and

351
00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:34.970
Meredith McCanse (she/her): was got very excited about it. And I

352
00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:44.040
Meredith McCanse (she/her): have 0 coding experience. And I'm not a data engineer, and I'm not going to be a data engineer. But I do work with data a lot. And so

353
00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:53.449
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I'm hoping I can eventually be a person that someone hires me to help their accounting team and automate their stuff and

354
00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:58.029
Meredith McCanse (she/her): help their internal accounting stuff go more quickly.

355
00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:12.170
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I'm based in Denver before this career I was a professional modern dancer in New York for about 10 years, and after I retired I went back to graduate school, and I went to graduate school and got an Mba. In accounting.

356
00:53:12.250 --> 00:53:16.170
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I also I have a wrist injury right now. II

357
00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:27.809
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I'm wearing a brace that I can't doesn't let me straighten my elbow. Some typing is challenging. Ii ordered a special keyboard that actually just got delivered a few minutes ago. So I'm gonna run downstairs and grab it before it gets

358
00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:29.570
Meredith McCanse (she/her): stolen.

359
00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:35.130
Meredith McCanse (she/her): but I'm hoping I can figure out. I know I know this is gonna be typing heavy. And

360
00:53:35.330 --> 00:53:39.949
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I'm hoping to figure out a way to be able to not get left behind in that aspect. So

361
00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:41.770
Meredith McCanse (she/her): that's me fine.

362
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:44.789
Anthony Taylor: That's great. So what kind of dancing? Modern

363
00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:46.980
Meredith McCanse (she/her): dancing?

364
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:52.920
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yeah. And there's lots of different types of modern dance. But well, yeah.

365
00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:57.420
Anthony Taylor: I mean, in my day the hustle was more so good.

366
00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:05.400
Anthony Taylor: Alright, I'm gonna drop off screen for a second to run downstairs and pick up that second.

367
00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:11.239
Meredith McCanse (she/her): You're gonna miss half them and Sonia. But that's all right. I'll be back in a jiffy. Okay.

368
00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:13.160
Anthony Taylor: all right, half them you're up.

369
00:54:17.110 --> 00:54:19.449
Haftom Gebrekirstos: hey, guys? I'm Hafton.

370
00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:29.600
Haftom Gebrekirstos: So I've been doing? I've been a data professional for the last 7 years, 7 plus years I've been doing business, intelligence and data engineering as well.

371
00:54:30.250 --> 00:54:40.289
Haftom Gebrekirstos: The reason I joined this class is I wanna advance my knowledge. And you know, in data processes, and I don't wanna be out of Job. It looks like

372
00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:45.600
Haftom Gebrekirstos: Bi is getting replaced by AI. So that's one is the reason some.

373
00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:50.150
Haftom Gebrekirstos: What kind of tools did you use in your data engineering?

374
00:54:50.550 --> 00:55:05.960
Haftom Gebrekirstos: I started out with altrix. She mentioned altrax drop auto box kind of tool. And then I used Adf azure data factory.

375
00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:19.409
Haftom Gebrekirstos: oh, great! And you know a lot of SQL. Platforms, SMS and python as well. A little bit of python

376
00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:23.470
Haftom Gebrekirstos: correct. I have mostly in Panda.

377
00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:31.169
Haftom Gebrekirstos: Alright. Well, you'll have a pretty easy time the first couple of weeks, because it's mostly gonna be getting everybody up off

378
00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:37.429
Anthony Taylor: but cool. We'll get into harder stuff. Phones. Yeah, that's awesome.

379
00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:38.380
Anthony Taylor: Aye.

380
00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:42.000
Sonya. Last, but not least.

381
00:55:44.700 --> 00:56:16.689
Sonja Baro (she/hers): you said it perfectly, Anthony. It's Sonya like Lasagna. Thank you. And Tanya. It's nice to find exactly. And Tanya wave at me, cause I was like a kindred spirit with a There you are. Hello! Well, I'm excited to be with you guys. And I shared. I think, in the slack that I'm a little nervous as well, because II haven't. I'm not a coder. I have a background in a product management and marketing. So really upstream to development.

382
00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:34.370
Sonja Baro (she/hers): And recently, had taken a turn from that went to work for a nonprofit that is near and dear to my heart. The American Diabetes Association. I was with them for 6 years, was trying to get a nonprofit to try and take technology to help with their mission.

383
00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:49.449
Sonja Baro (she/hers): wasn't quite what I wanted. So I wanted to come back into technology. And I think the key for me was to level up my skills, which is, as I've been out of product management for a little bit of time with that pivot to Aba

384
00:56:49.450 --> 00:57:11.970
Sonja Baro (she/hers): and so super super excited about our AI and the potential good it has for the the potential for good, for so many aspects of a society. For me it would be fo I'd be focused in health care is that's where my background is. And you were asking, you know, anything

385
00:57:11.970 --> 00:57:35.850
Sonja Baro (she/hers): interesting? Quite honestly, listening to all you guys, I'm really boring. Oh, but I try to have fun. So that's one thing that I will tell you. And then the other thing that I looked back on what I really enjoyed projects that I had done in the past, and where we really successful is when I was working with engineers and project managers and the team, and we were working as a a

386
00:57:35.860 --> 00:58:05.500
Sonja Baro (she/hers): cohesive team, each bringing their talent to the to the stage, if you will, and one of the things I found was, I did a better job if I wasn't trying to replace my engineer, my coder. But I was trying to understand and communicate with them in the language that they were you using. And so that's what I would try to do. So I've earmarked a couple of you guys to just know I'm coming after you for study group partners.

387
00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:13.089
Sonja Baro (she/hers): So I'm not far from you. Derek. I'm just up the road from boulder in Louisville, Lafayette area.

388
00:58:14.550 --> 00:58:20.179
Clayton Graves: I've been. I've been doing this for 20 years, and I still don't know the language, so don't don't even sweat it.

389
00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:23.049
Clayton Graves: I have to turn to all the yearly.

390
00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:25.899
Sonja Baro (she/hers): Yeah, thank you. Clayton.

391
00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:30.660
Anthony Taylor: Awesome. Well. welcome.

392
00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:39.009
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So couple of a couple of more little things, and then we're gonna get started on something.

393
00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:48.329
Anthony Taylor: at least some right? So let me share the way this class basically works, about 99% of the time

394
00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:51.779
Anthony Taylor: is I am going to

395
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:56.689
Anthony Taylor: talk about stuff, show you stuff, send you away so you can go do stuff.

396
00:58:56.880 --> 00:59:03.859
Anthony Taylor: You're going to come back. Tell me how you did the stuff. And then I'm going to show you more stuff. Okay? And it's fact.

397
00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:09.750
Anthony Taylor: Gabriela tried to point you. It's fast.

398
00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:17.949
Anthony Taylor: It is not because I want it to be fast. It is fast because we have a tremendous amount of material that we're going to give you.

399
00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:22.609
Anthony Taylor: The good news is it'll only feel fat. Well.

400
00:59:23.790 --> 00:59:29.250
Anthony Taylor: okay, based on my experience. And again, slightly different curriculum for the data. Science one.

401
00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:32.560
Anthony Taylor: But it's only fast for about 4 weeks.

402
00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:43.059
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then you're gonna come to me and you're gonna say. Yeah, alright. Well, you're going slower now, and it's like, no. it didn't slow down. You finally caught up.

403
00:59:43.490 --> 00:59:48.909
Anthony Taylor: You're now learning. So the first thing we're going to do is you're going to learn to learn

404
00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:52.140
Anthony Taylor: at a much faster pace than you probably used to.

405
00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:56.800
Anthony Taylor: Okay, which is great fun. And I'm gonna make it fun.

406
00:59:57.050 --> 01:00:05.440
Anthony Taylor: says what I do. I make it fun.  The end. Oh, wait! Did I push? I didn't push the send button.

407
01:00:07.590 --> 01:00:14.260
Anthony Taylor: I just sent out a link to what you're seeing on my screen right now. Okay.

408
01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:27.420
Anthony Taylor:  this is classroom norms. Hopefully, some or most of you have already looked at this alright, who's not gonna go over it line by line? Here's some highlights.

409
01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:29.690
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so, and and

410
01:00:29.830 --> 01:00:33.459
Anthony Taylor: this, this is actually used by a lot of instructors.

411
01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:39.919
Anthony Taylor: Because I was actually the instructor mentor for the data science instructors throughout

412
01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:48.300
Anthony Taylor: our organization. So everybody uses this and sees it. But okay. so first off.

413
01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:55.320
Anthony Taylor: we already talked about 10 min. Not gonna get into it. Please try to be a few minutes early. Don't come right at 6 30.

414
01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:58.909
Anthony Taylor: I start right at 6 30.

415
01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:06.890
Anthony Taylor: If you're here at 6, 32, you have no idea what you just missed, and it could be important. That means you have to go back and look at the recording

416
01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:13.720
Anthony Taylor:  and and I do encourage you to look at the accord, because it is fast.

417
01:01:14.330 --> 01:01:16.209
Anthony Taylor: The only way to slow me down.

418
01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:20.730
Anthony Taylor: Watch me on a recording and slow me down. It's okay, Clayton. You don't.

419
01:01:20.830 --> 01:01:28.710
Anthony Taylor: I do absolutely look at your faces. I enjoy it. I do the stint as a stand-up comic, and I enjoy seeing your faces.

420
01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:36.210
Anthony Taylor: Okay. It makes it keeps me energetic. You will find I am extremely energetic. Right? Kev.

421
01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:43.220
Anthony Taylor: Yes, Kevin will tell you that he see me in person. I make people sweat by how much I move.

422
01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:47.070
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so

423
01:01:53.490 --> 01:02:04.350
Anthony Taylor: questions. So all of you look on your Zoom Bar, you'll see you have a little raise your hand thing. I hate to seem so formal about it. But here's why I actually asked you to do this.

424
01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:09.199
Anthony Taylor: Okay, is that way? If more than one of you ask a question.

425
01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:20.319
Anthony Taylor: I will see it, and I will answer each question as you as you raised your hand. Okay, it's not so much, you know. I'm not really like all hung up on. If you interrupt me, I don't.

426
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:23.839
Anthony Taylor: Okay. If you have something you want to say, and it's that exciting

427
01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:25.270
Anthony Taylor: jump in there.

428
01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:30.950
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if this is the question. Raise your hand, and then I will.

429
01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:34.079
Anthony Taylor: I will pick you as you raised your hand.

430
01:02:34.330 --> 01:02:35.120
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

431
01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:43.790
Anthony Taylor: office hours. So let me tell you about office hours. Anthony's office hours are different than other instructors office hours

432
01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:49.870
Anthony Taylor: in the sense that that is where I would say most students get the most value

433
01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:52.120
Anthony Taylor: out of me.

434
01:02:53.010 --> 01:03:05.889
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And I say that like this, here's the thing and and and and this is a little different than our data science class. But I'll tell you what I told the data science students, I said, the material we're about to give you over the next 24 weeks. You can get it.

435
01:03:06.610 --> 01:03:09.710
Anthony Taylor: All kinds of Jimmy

436
01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:15.239
Anthony Taylor: Edx. No, we are edx. You can get it on different sites. Linkedin, learning.

437
01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:18.010
Anthony Taylor: Okay, what you're paying for.

438
01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:19.340
Anthony Taylor: It's me.

439
01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:24.599
Anthony Taylor: I am bringing you experience how we we use this every day.

440
01:03:24.690 --> 01:03:35.230
Anthony Taylor: new things, new, new, new new things. Okay, when you go to a college course and and I have lots of of Cs students that come into. I boot camp.

441
01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:41.009
Anthony Taylor: They're learning stuff sometimes a year old, 6 months old, 5 years old.

442
01:03:41.770 --> 01:03:47.049
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I'm going to show you stuff that we're doing in the workforce

443
01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:48.310
Anthony Taylor: today.

444
01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:50.330
Anthony Taylor: Right now.

445
01:03:50.730 --> 01:03:57.000
Anthony Taylor: Okay, people are paying me money to do for them today. That's what you're going to learn. Now, here's the problem.

446
01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:59.390
Anthony Taylor: The curriculum is the curriculum.

447
01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:05.460
Anthony Taylor: I can't show you that extra stuff when I need to teach you the curriculum. So when do I do it?

448
01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:07.310
Office?

449
01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:22.109
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I will tell you if it's going to be something special. But normally, what happens during office hours is something like this. Natalie, who, by the way, was first one in today? I just read Natalie by.

450
01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:28.910
Anthony Taylor: but she was right. I wasn't even done setting up yet. Natalie was there, and she was asking questions. I'm like, that's fantastic.

451
01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:37.069
Anthony Taylor: but people will come in and they'll go. So I was thinking about. You know, how does this work in this field?

452
01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:40.279
Anthony Taylor: And I might go for 20 min explaining that.

453
01:04:41.370 --> 01:04:44.589
Anthony Taylor: And it's material you're never gonna get in class.

454
01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:51.719
Anthony Taylor: because it's specific question. Alright. So I'm not trying to convince all of you to come to office hours something you just can't I get it?

455
01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:58.379
Anthony Taylor: But leading me. Sitting alone with these 2 tas

456
01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:02.680
Anthony Taylor: for like 15 to 20 min is a waste of your life.

457
01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:10.349
Anthony Taylor: Alright, cause you could be asking me questions about anything in this field, and if I don't know the answer, and the tas don't know the answer.

458
01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:12.040
Anthony Taylor: I will find

459
01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:15.080
Anthony Taylor: if I have to ask Chat T. Myself.

460
01:05:15.970 --> 01:05:18.980
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Alright.

461
01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:22.719
Anthony Taylor: moving on. Homework

462
01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:27.999
Anthony Taylor: guys. if I can tell you one thing that I want you to remember.

463
01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:38.269
Anthony Taylor: do not fall too far behind on homework. Do you have to be right on time? I'm gonna be honest with you. You don't try to be okay, but you don't have to be

464
01:05:39.050 --> 01:05:50.139
Anthony Taylor: what I always recommend is this first day of the new section. Each section is 3 lectures long. First day of the new section. Don't do anything. Maybe go look at.

465
01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:51.640
Anthony Taylor: This is what I'm gonna do.

466
01:05:51.810 --> 01:05:57.509
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Second day, you're going to have enough information to get it started. Get it started

467
01:05:58.710 --> 01:06:02.389
Anthony Taylor: alright the last day. You're gonna have everything you need to finish it

468
01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:05.659
Anthony Taylor: before Monday rolls around. Finish it.

469
01:06:06.090 --> 01:06:14.320
Anthony Taylor: That gives you like Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I know 2 weekend man. I know I get it. Get it okay. Just knock it out

470
01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:24.600
Anthony Taylor: all right. If you and that way when you start Monday, get a new topic. and you don't have to worry about the old topic or on the new topic. Okay, I have seen

471
01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:26.779
Anthony Taylor: so many miserable students

472
01:06:26.910 --> 01:06:39.190
Anthony Taylor: that did not miserable, not as in. They were bad people, but miserable because they didn't keep up. So they're like 10 homeworks behind. And there's 2 weeks left in class, and they got to do all 10 of them in 2 weeks.

473
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:46.669
Anthony Taylor: It's not pretty safe. I mean, they're they're like I was up for 48 h just to get 3 of them done, and I'm like

474
01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:48.040
Anthony Taylor: sounds about right.

475
01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:59.429
Anthony Taylor: That's why I tell you, on the first day don't fall on  Cool the schedule office hours with the Ta. So when you click this.

476
01:06:59.550 --> 01:07:07.090
Anthony Taylor: you will get a cool box like this. And you just click one that's there on the screen. Once you schedule it.

477
01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:14.789
Anthony Taylor: it's gone. Nobody else can schedule that time. This year this class was small. We probably won't have a problem with this, and we have 2 da's, which is unusual

478
01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:16.579
Anthony Taylor: for a class this size.

479
01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:20.389
Anthony Taylor: So they probably all never run into this. But we do this

480
01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.620
Anthony Taylor: for 15 min slaps.

481
01:07:22.810 --> 01:07:27.350
Anthony Taylor: You say I need a ta. Help me with my my Ssh key.

482
01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:28.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

483
01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:35.250
Anthony Taylor: you come in. Be there for your slot. They help you. If no one else is in line

484
01:07:35.350 --> 01:07:39.250
Anthony Taylor: to see a ta, and you still need help. You can stay in there with them

485
01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:49.210
Anthony Taylor: all right. But if someone else is there? Yeah. And the reason we do this, guys, I'll tell you real quick. When I first went from onsite to Zoom, we had like students that would come

486
01:07:49.250 --> 01:08:00.629
Anthony Taylor: the second I opened the zoom room and ask for ta. and then they'd have that ta for the whole 45 min. And I was like this isn't good because we got people that can't be there. The second I opened the book

487
01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:03.729
Anthony Taylor: right. They can't get there until 60'clock, or whatever.

488
01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:21.190
Anthony Taylor: and they just never could get a ta. So that's why I built this whole scheduling system. It's really not fancy, but it works wonderful. Okay? Breakout rooms. So as we do activities, you will be sent to rooms of 3 each.

489
01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:30.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay, sometime, maybe 4. Occasionally, if that numbers are off alright in those rooms one person will open will share their screen.

490
01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:33.920
Anthony Taylor: The group. We'll do the activity.

491
01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:40.229
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So the person sharing screens not doing all of the work they're typing.

492
01:08:40.410 --> 01:08:42.709
Anthony Taylor: So we're not gonna make merit type for a while.

493
01:08:42.930 --> 01:08:46.759
Anthony Taylor: Okay? All right. Yeah, so. But

494
01:08:46.819 --> 01:08:52.390
Anthony Taylor: all 3 people or 4 people in the room need to be contributing cameras on coffee.

495
01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:59.800
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this is how we we keep up. So yeah, this explains that activity.

496
01:08:59.979 --> 01:09:05.899
Anthony Taylor: Okay. slack norms is basically the same stuff she just told me, don't be a jerk.

497
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:09.220
Anthony Taylor: Okay? This.

498
01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:21.020
Anthony Taylor: They they just changed my channels like a little while ago. Most of these channels appear to be correct, if any of them you don't see yet. That's because we don't need them yet.

499
01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:25.610
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but this is a description of each channel, and how you should use it.

500
01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:28.490
Anthony Taylor: Just notice, there's a misspelling in there. That's it.

501
01:09:28.810 --> 01:09:39.010
Anthony Taylor:  okay, keyboard glossary. I know some of you are like, I really put that there. How many of you show a hand knows where a backtick is on your keyboard.

502
01:09:39.779 --> 01:09:44.390
Anthony Taylor: Just wave at the screen. If you know where a back tick is okay.

503
01:09:44.479 --> 01:09:47.049
Anthony Taylor: Some of you don't. That's what this is for.

504
01:09:47.670 --> 01:09:52.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's amazing. I mean, not amazing. But it is.

505
01:09:52.990 --> 01:10:00.090
Anthony Taylor: It is surprising sometimes when you're like, Well, where's a pipe key? I don't know. Okay, this just makes it easier

506
01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:04.470
Anthony Taylor: for me. If nothing, Nelson, everything is about me.

507
01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:06.799
Anthony Taylor: And I'm about all of you.

508
01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:16.689
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So here we got some cool little typing test practice things you could do there. But I haven't checked these in a while. I usually try to check these every cohort.

509
01:10:16.890 --> 01:10:23.350
Anthony Taylor: This one's got games with typing. You don't need this if you don't need it. It's just a little thing I threw out there.

510
01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:32.120
Anthony Taylor: For people cause a lot of development is about being able to get to things quickly. Okay, believe it or not the shortcut game.

511
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:48.099
Anthony Taylor:  using shortcuts, keyboard shortcuts. If I see right clicking and copy and right clicking and pasting, I don't have a problem, but I'll say, Hey, you could do that with fancy or control C or blah, blah blah. And and you know about halfway through, I'll be like, really.

512
01:10:49.330 --> 01:10:55.539
Anthony Taylor: okay, so yeah, we'll we'll get to it. Don't worry about it. How many of you show a hands? Are

513
01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:58.099
Anthony Taylor: Mac users right now are using a Mac?

514
01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:01.850
Anthony Taylor: Oh. oh.

515
01:11:02.730 --> 01:11:09.789
Anthony Taylor: all right. Oh, wait! Okay, wait now. That was more bids. How many you guys? One more time everybody put your hand up in front of screen. Let me see.

516
01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:18.780
Anthony Taylor: Michael Rodney. You're not, you are, Michael, are you, Matt? Oh, okay. alright. Kevin is your best friend.

517
01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:25.320
Anthony Taylor: Okay, Anthony is not. I will teach you everything except how to use your Mac.

518
01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:30.980
Anthony Taylor: All right? Yeah, it's not that I have problem. I mean, I

519
01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:33.510
Anthony Taylor: I will joke.

520
01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:35.380
Anthony Taylor: But

521
01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:40.630
Anthony Taylor: II know they're good compute. I do. I used to have one. It was back there.

522
01:11:40.670 --> 01:11:49.960
Anthony Taylor: So that I can help students, and I just make sure. Now I have a ta with maxives, cause I was like. No, I can't. I just can't.

523
01:11:50.210 --> 01:11:50.920
can't

524
01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:52.119
Anthony Taylor: do a Mac

525
01:11:52.410 --> 01:11:59.500
Anthony Taylor: so I gave it away. It's great, best moment of my life. Okay, next resources.

526
01:11:59.870 --> 01:12:08.420
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Last, actually, you know what? I'm not gonna go change this. Some of you were mentioning that you were having trouble with the Ssh. Key, and

527
01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:11.660
Anthony Taylor: I just looked at the at the free work. And I'm like.

528
01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:17.589
Anthony Taylor: that's totally different than the way it was last cohort. It's way easier now.

529
01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:22.039
Anthony Taylor: so we'll be able to help you. So if this doesn't help you, probably didn't.

530
01:12:22.090 --> 01:12:29.480
Anthony Taylor: We'll, we'll help you with that. Don't worry. BS. Code. You will live in Vs code through most of this course.

531
01:12:29.610 --> 01:12:32.499
Anthony Taylor: if you have not downloaded and installed it. And so

532
01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:38.559
Anthony Taylor: before next class. Okay, the S code is a spectacular Id.

533
01:12:39.150 --> 01:12:41.060
Anthony Taylor: It's like taking the world

534
01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:42.659
Anthony Taylor: over pretty much.

535
01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:46.700
Anthony Taylor: Hi, we will do some of this.

536
01:12:46.710 --> 01:12:50.230
Anthony Taylor: Well, we'll do the steps for this in class.

537
01:12:50.290 --> 01:12:57.650
Anthony Taylor: Oh. darn it! That's the wrong folder name. Hold on! Let me fix that. I'm going to fix that now.

538
01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:01.830
Anthony Taylor:  Oh, wait! Oh, that's the link.

539
01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:10.780
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we'll we'll get that fixed for you. Asap.  These are right. The folder names are right. Just the link.

540
01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:23.180
Anthony Taylor: But you guys have your git lab link separately. This is a lot of fun. Cheat sheets to all literally. There is a cheat sheet for practically everything known to man

541
01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:24.720
Anthony Taylor: right here.

542
01:13:27.150 --> 01:13:30.119
Anthony Taylor: Oh, well, I was looking for an a 6 home that there's not.

543
01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:31.630
Anthony Taylor: That would have been funny.

544
01:13:31.670 --> 01:13:36.880
Anthony Taylor:  calculus that all of us need a cheat for calculus.

545
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:41.719
Anthony Taylor: right? And there it is complete cheat sheet.

546
01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:48.750
Anthony Taylor: There you go. So it's a really fun thing. Lots cheat sheets are great.

547
01:13:48.910 --> 01:13:56.930
Anthony Taylor: Having this kind of information available to you is spectacular Vs code extension.

548
01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:05.059
Anthony Taylor: you can get all of these extensions. You may not need all of these extensions in this class. I did not change it from my data science class.

549
01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:13.020
Anthony Taylor: You guys are gonna actually cover everything we cover in the data science class except Javascript and HTML,

550
01:14:13.390 --> 01:14:22.409
Anthony Taylor: alright. But you guys get a whole bunch more. So actually, one of the things I'm trying to do is get them. I'm I'm on the Advisory committee for this course.

551
01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:27.900
Anthony Taylor: and I'm trying to get them to make the first 12 weeks. The stuff we cover in the data science class.

552
01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:36.610
Anthony Taylor: And then the second 12 weeks to the only specific AI related that way. We could bring our data class graduates in as well.

553
01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:37.999
Anthony Taylor: That would be fun.

554
01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:42.750
Anthony Taylor: Get smart down. This is just a bunch of fun stuff

555
01:14:43.230 --> 01:14:47.810
Anthony Taylor: those things. You don't need it. But if you want it, you got it. Okay, getting help.

556
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:55.469
Anthony Taylor: We've talked about a lot of this during a breakout. There will be a button at the bottom. I think it says, ask for help.

557
01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:57.590
Anthony Taylor: That button page is me

558
01:14:58.870 --> 01:15:08.049
Anthony Taylor: all right. If I am not already in a room I will instantly appear in your breakout room. Okay, it's like a genie. Rub the lamp

559
01:15:08.610 --> 01:15:09.740
Anthony Taylor: I show up.

560
01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:25.340
Anthony Taylor: Okay. If I am busy it might take a minute, or I'll ask Kevin or James to come in for me. We still bounce around. We'll see you in the breakout rooms either way. Don't get nervous if we come in. We're just staring at you intensely

561
01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:29.650
Anthony Taylor: alright to make you nervous. That's our job, but it's alright

562
01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:31.180
Anthony Taylor: you're under pressure.

563
01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:41.189
Anthony Taylor: Ask the getting help outside class. So in your slack. Oh, you can't see it. There is a community. Ask Channel and a homework help channel.

564
01:15:41.210 --> 01:15:44.150
Anthony Taylor: Honestly, we could have done just one of those. But whatever

565
01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:46.619
Anthony Taylor: okay, the idea is.

566
01:15:47.170 --> 01:15:48.879
Anthony Taylor: ask your questions. There.

567
01:15:48.890 --> 01:15:57.679
Anthony Taylor: I'm not gonna answer them. Tas aren't gonna answer. You're like, what? Well, what's the point? The point is is, I want you guys to answer.

568
01:15:58.850 --> 01:15:59.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

569
01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:04.550
Anthony Taylor: the better. The more you guys interact with each other in this type way.

570
01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:11.089
Anthony Taylor: the better you're going to be all right. Now. here's the good news. I just can't resist.

571
01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:17.779
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if I see a question sitting here for like a day, I'm gonna answer. If I see someone answer it wrong, I'm gonna say something.

572
01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:29.219
Anthony Taylor: Okay. I can't resist. I see the question literally the instant it comes up. But I try not to answer it right away. Tutoring all of you are entitled to tutoring.

573
01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:31.930
Anthony Taylor: You can sign up with Nick.

574
01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:35.380
Anthony Taylor: There might even be a way to do it automatically now.

575
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:38.510
Anthony Taylor: Oh, God! Ronnie would.

576
01:16:39.050 --> 01:16:41.680
Anthony Taylor: Hello. Rodney!

577
01:16:41.890 --> 01:16:44.010
Anthony Taylor: Alright, anyway.

578
01:16:44.230 --> 01:16:56.569
Anthony Taylor: it's a great thing. Sign up, anyway, guys. If you think you don't even need it sign up. You don't have to schedule it, but when you run into that topic you're struggling with, and you want an extra hour of tutoring.

579
01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:59.040
Anthony Taylor: Good place to go. Tutors

580
01:16:59.470 --> 01:17:04.250
Anthony Taylor: are all levels of people you never know who you're going to get. They could be a total jerk. By the way.

581
01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:09.460
Anthony Taylor: okay, I've met some total jerk tutors. It could be an instructor. That's just making some extra money.

582
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:21.800
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it could be tas that are just making some extra money. And other times they're just people who have graduated. And since nobody has graduated from this AI course, it'll be interesting to see how that goes.

583
01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:25.649
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But like, I said, a lot of the first

584
01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:32.389
Anthony Taylor: half is is material that we cover in data, science and stuff, anyway. So it all works out.

585
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:38.630
Anthony Taylor: Ask. Pcs. I've had mixed reviews on Sbcs. But most of them have been good.

586
01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:45.580
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so ask your question, Mayor. I will tell you. When you get to projects. They will not help.

587
01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:54.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if you ask a question during project time, they will. Oh.  and then, last.

588
01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:56.620
Anthony Taylor: and very importantly.

589
01:17:56.860 --> 01:18:02.220
Anthony Taylor: our friend Chat GPT. Or Bard, or bing chat.

590
01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:03.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

591
01:18:04.250 --> 01:18:10.569
Anthony Taylor: what do you guys think? Do you think I'm gonna say, go ahead and use it. What do you think I'm dying to know who says I'm gonna tell you to use it?

592
01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:17.450
Anthony Taylor: Great. Okay. So here's my, here's my story ready.

593
01:18:17.530 --> 01:18:22.480
Anthony Taylor: So when I started in computers back at the video game company.

594
01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:27.120
Anthony Taylor: Okay? We had no Internet.

595
01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:32.360
Anthony Taylor: no one on the Internet. I mean, it was out there, but not not for us.

596
01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:45.449
Anthony Taylor:  so I went to bookstore B. Dalton. Anybody remember B. Dalp bookstore? They're still around. I think. I went to be dumb, and I got a book. and I read the book. And I did the work.

597
01:18:45.890 --> 01:18:48.599
Anthony Taylor: and it broke. And then I had to fix it.

598
01:18:48.670 --> 01:18:53.070
Anthony Taylor: And you know who helped me nobody because it was no Internet

599
01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:01.419
Anthony Taylor: alright. So eventually, Google came around. And all of a sudden I could query

600
01:19:02.590 --> 01:19:06.530
Anthony Taylor: whole bunch of books all at once. Right?

601
01:19:06.930 --> 01:19:09.350
Anthony Taylor: Course, there were Internet pages. But you get the idea?

602
01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:15.309
Anthony Taylor: No one said to me, Anthony. it's cheating. If you use Google

603
01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:21.980
Anthony Taylor: alright, it's the most ridiculous statement I've ever heard to even think that.

604
01:19:22.190 --> 01:19:28.599
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Using Chat Gp, or Bard, or pink chat is not cheap.

605
01:19:30.690 --> 01:19:35.319
Anthony Taylor: Now I'm going to take it. I'm going to take this couple. We're kind of starting our AI talk.

606
01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:37.620
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

607
01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:44.250
Anthony Taylor: it. AI is not going to replace any of us in the foreseeable future.

608
01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:48.080
Anthony Taylor: Somebody who knows how to use it

609
01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:51.209
Anthony Taylor: will absolutely replace you. If you don't

610
01:19:53.010 --> 01:19:56.140
Anthony Taylor: alright, and that is the fact.

611
01:19:56.910 --> 01:20:00.250
Anthony Taylor: Okay, when you know how to use it, you will be faster.

612
01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:02.479
Anthony Taylor: You will be more efficient.

613
01:20:02.690 --> 01:20:12.790
Anthony Taylor: You will be able to do more than you were able to do previously. And I don't mean more like the efficient and faster. I mean more difficult

614
01:20:12.890 --> 01:20:13.800
Anthony Taylor: tasks.

615
01:20:15.230 --> 01:20:22.339
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it is what Google was to me back when Google became available to all the rest of us.

616
01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:26.570
Anthony Taylor: And it's getting better at the crazy fast rate.

617
01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:34.879
Anthony Taylor: So what we're here to really learn is how, not how to use Chateau D, and I want you to use it.

618
01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:45.399
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but we're here to to make these make chat, tpt, make bard make being chat all of these tools and how they get driven work for us

619
01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:50.469
Anthony Taylor: in a way that maybe the average user doesn't know how to do.

620
01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:52.120
Anthony Taylor: Not. Maybe they don't.

621
01:20:53.550 --> 01:20:56.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's what this class needs.

622
01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:03.729
Anthony Taylor: One last note on the on the the Gpt engines. Okay.

623
01:21:04.230 --> 01:21:05.799
Anthony Taylor: if you

624
01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:17.960
Anthony Taylor: ask it, how do I code? You know, how do I? How do I code a pandas data frame to filter out all records, you know, with the word U.S.A.

625
01:21:18.430 --> 01:21:20.450
Anthony Taylor: And it writes.

626
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:29.969
Anthony Taylor: import pandas. Do this important done properly. Taste, turn it in. You have just replaced yourself.

627
01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:35.710
Anthony Taylor: Do you understand. If you don't understand what it told you.

628
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:45.789
Anthony Taylor: then you've replaced yourself. You've shown your boss, or whoever that, hey? I can be. Replacements type the right prompt, and you got

629
01:21:46.830 --> 01:21:57.839
Anthony Taylor: so the goal here is that when you see it and I'll actually give you Demos of this, we'll ask you questions, and then we're going to go. Okay, we'll clarify this, clarify this. We're going to ask it enough questions

630
01:21:58.180 --> 01:22:02.740
Anthony Taylor: so that we know so that we at least understand what it's telling us.

631
01:22:02.910 --> 01:22:04.389
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright.

632
01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:22.510
Anthony Taylor: By the way, today is very yeah. Merited. Yeah, can I ask a quick question just about like stuff like that? Is, if we know in advance a certain date that we're going to miss, do you? Would you like us to tell you in advance, or should we tell anyone, or just

633
01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:27.489
Anthony Taylor: let us know, so that we don't like wait for you.

634
01:22:27.970 --> 01:22:34.240
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, usually even the day of it slack like Kevin and James, that's enough.

635
01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:41.509
Anthony Taylor: You know. Just say, Hey, I'm not gonna make it. But you know, cause if you tell us the week to do in advance, I guarantee you I may not.

636
01:22:41.810 --> 01:22:44.150
Anthony Taylor: Kevin and James have way. Better memories than me.

637
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:50.729
Anthony Taylor: I'm I'm way old, so it's just the way it works. Okay. So yes, thank you. Great question.

638
01:22:50.850 --> 01:22:54.679
Anthony Taylor: Okay, one more. One more question. No. Go ahead.

639
01:22:55.320 --> 01:23:02.290
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Do you tend to like, take a break anywhere in the 3 h like a restroom break, or in the next 6 min you're gonna get it right.

640
01:23:02.630 --> 01:23:07.550
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I promise. I tried to do it right at at for, you guys, it would be 80'clock.

641
01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:21.030
Anthony Taylor:  and it's like 15. So depends on the thing, you know. Sometimes we go over, sometimes little early, so like I'm gonna start like one or 2 of these slides, maybe depending on

642
01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:22.810
Anthony Taylor: my last, my next statement.

643
01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:31.299
Anthony Taylor: what was my next day? I don't remember. Oh, wow! We'll get to it. Okay, let's talk about what we're gonna do today, and then we'll take a break. Okay.

644
01:23:31.350 --> 01:23:39.299
Anthony Taylor:  So we've already done this yay, one is done. We've introduced ourselves. We all know each other.

645
01:23:39.450 --> 01:23:46.220
Anthony Taylor: You know, we're golden, right? Understand? The course formats. If you you guys really did that already, too.

646
01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:50.399
Anthony Taylor: Okay. The format is, I'm gonna talk. I'm gonna do. You're gonna do. I'm gonna talk.

647
01:23:50.570 --> 01:23:54.760
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna do that over and over again. And we're gonna learn lots of cool stuff.

648
01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:59.939
Anthony Taylor:  I'm gonna be honest with you guys, Rick.

649
01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:06.949
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I am on the Advisory Council that is building this curriculum. And we know what we want

650
01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:17.189
Anthony Taylor: to to give you guys. And I don't know that the list of stuff on here is is up to the minute. Okay, so we'll talk about the course topics, but

651
01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:26.030
Anthony Taylor: because of how fast this is moving, and we have an interesting capability with this course that I've never had before.

652
01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:28.159
Anthony Taylor: and that we can literally

653
01:24:28.190 --> 01:24:32.559
Anthony Taylor: call the curriculum team and say, Hey, you know, in 2 weeks where you were, gonna do this.

654
01:24:33.450 --> 01:24:35.670
Anthony Taylor: that's no good anymore. Do this instead.

655
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:51.630
Anthony Taylor: and they'll change it. They'll make it into something more current. So this is gonna be really kind of fun in that sense. We're very sure that of what we need to cover. But there's some cool twists and technology right now that are making us go. Hey? Maybe we could do this. Maybe we could do that.

656
01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:53.439
Anthony Taylor: So it's kind of fun.

657
01:24:53.550 --> 01:25:02.500
Anthony Taylor: So of course, we're gonna define AI and Ml today differentiate between the 2. You do know they're different, right? Or are they? Hmm.

658
01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:09.109
Anthony Taylor: and we're going to illustrate the difference between generalized and narrow AI. We did that

659
01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:12.919
Anthony Taylor: growth mindset. Okay, so here's where we'll stop.

660
01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:17.849
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna give you guys 15 come back at like 8, 10,

661
01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:23.579
Anthony Taylor: or 8, 12, whatever, 8, 10. It's good enough. Go quick, nearly lost a minute.

662
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:26.320
Anthony Taylor: I'll see you guys in 15 min

663
01:25:29.470 --> 01:25:30.210
tap it

664
01:25:30.570 --> 01:25:35.439
Anthony Taylor: alright, cause I stopped it while we're break. So you guys don't like while you're watching the video, you're like.

665
01:25:36.370 --> 01:25:47.699
Anthony Taylor: it's like 15 min break right here. That's ridiculous. Okay, that's no fun at all. Alright. So we're still not really into the cool stuff yet. But we're getting there, I promise.

666
01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:49.590
Anthony Taylor: So first

667
01:25:49.650 --> 01:25:57.710
Anthony Taylor: this is more talking about the whole boot camp experience, and we know Gabriel's done a boot camp for any of the rest of you ever done a boot camp?

668
01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:00.750
Anthony Taylor: How about military? I did military boot camp?

669
01:26:02.770 --> 01:26:04.579
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Matt's done it.

670
01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:11.590
Anthony Taylor: Michael's done it. So yeah, I was in the Air Force. I know it wasn't real Boot camp, but it was Boot camp.

671
01:26:11.670 --> 01:26:13.069
Anthony Taylor: At least that's what they called it.

672
01:26:13.810 --> 01:26:18.599
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Those of you that are in the army and marines. You guys didn't. Real boot camp, maybe.

673
01:26:18.810 --> 01:26:20.150
Anthony Taylor: Matt, what are you in?

674
01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:25.159
Dipinto, Matt: Sorry. So on the mic oza Army

675
01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:30.220
Anthony Taylor: heard me. Oh, yeah, you you worked, hey? Michael Mike.

676
01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:38.219
michael mcpherson: I was in the army. I got out.

677
01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:44.370
Anthony Taylor: There you go. There you go. Well, thank you both for your service. That's cool.

678
01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:52.569
Anthony Taylor: anyway. Yeah. So that's real good. But this book is not a lot different except for it's in your brain.

679
01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:57.259
Anthony Taylor: even though real boot. Camp's really hard on the brain, too. But this is different. We're going to teach you stuff.

680
01:26:57.580 --> 01:27:02.129
Anthony Taylor: Okay, don't have to do 100 pushups. You just have to

681
01:27:02.570 --> 01:27:04.860
Anthony Taylor: be able to code a python data frame.

682
01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:09.929
Anthony Taylor: So just come here prepared to absorb.

683
01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:23.810
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I know some of you've got some some past technical experience, and that's great. I guarantee you, it's gonna make some things easier. It'll also give you some preconceived ideas on how things are done. So be aware

684
01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:30.860
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to try to. My my goal is not to break those things down. But I want you to do it my way

685
01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:32.190
Anthony Taylor: while we're doing this.

686
01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:40.429
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then, after we're through that thing, you can decide which way you like better what you've learned or the way I showed.

687
01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:51.969
Anthony Taylor: And it's fine. I don't mind either way. Alright.  My doubters had a couple of you already. Okay, don't worry about it yet.

688
01:27:52.210 --> 01:27:55.900
Anthony Taylor: You're fine, like, well, we got a week. Yeah, it's true. You only have a week.

689
01:27:55.970 --> 01:28:02.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I'm gonna tell you something. and I'm very proud of what I'm about to tell you. I almost never get drunk

690
01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:03.990
Anthony Taylor: almost never.

691
01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:13.869
Anthony Taylor: Okay during the cohort every once, while something horrible happened, and I'll get a drop. But I almost never get dropped, because I am here to tell you.

692
01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:17.630
Anthony Taylor: You will get through it. It will be hard

693
01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:24.849
Anthony Taylor: but me, Kevin and James will be here every step of the way to guide you through.

694
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:31.230
Anthony Taylor: And we've done this a lot. So we kind of know what we've got coming.

695
01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:37.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And we know where you're gonna struggle. The most. Okay. It's not easy.

696
01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:41.680
Anthony Taylor: but if it was easy it wouldn't get paid very well.

697
01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:45.690
Anthony Taylor: and that's why we're really here. We all want to get paid

698
01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:47.190
Anthony Taylor: right.

699
01:28:47.550 --> 01:28:50.729
Anthony Taylor: That's it. So let's let's realize.

700
01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:58.920
Anthony Taylor: you know people ask me outside. What you do is easy. I'm like, no, I make it look. If it was easy they wouldn't pay me so damn

701
01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:01.180
Anthony Taylor: okay.

702
01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:04.769
Anthony Taylor: so relish the novice experience. You know what

703
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:06.150
Anthony Taylor: it's like.

704
01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:08.420
Anthony Taylor: Barnett.

705
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:13.440
Anthony Taylor: I will give you the presentation

706
01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:18.060
Anthony Taylor: at the end actually might be in canvas, but I'll also put it in gitlab

707
01:29:18.230 --> 01:29:18.990
Anthony Taylor: for you

708
01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:22.410
Anthony Taylor: alright.

709
01:29:23.370 --> 01:29:26.110
Anthony Taylor: I talk about what was after. Where are you, Buddy?

710
01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:33.849
Anthony Taylor: I talk about what? See our spaces? And yeah, it's a requirement, I know. But there's more to it, right?

711
01:29:34.150 --> 01:29:38.960
Anthony Taylor: It's when I'm watching you, and we're doing stuff.

712
01:29:39.230 --> 01:29:42.639
Anthony Taylor: And you figure something out.

713
01:29:43.340 --> 01:29:48.169
Anthony Taylor: I get to relive that moment when I figured it out.

714
01:29:48.650 --> 01:29:57.309
Anthony Taylor: Okay, in you, I see you. And it's like Bam. You know what you're never going to figure that same thing out again.

715
01:29:57.810 --> 01:30:04.750
Anthony Taylor: You get one shot at. and when you figure it out it's exciting, and it feels good. Those are what keep me going every day.

716
01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:08.660
Anthony Taylor: and that's why, even at the level I'm at now.

717
01:30:08.730 --> 01:30:15.670
Anthony Taylor: I still constantly going out and trying new things and doing things. you know, with technology.

718
01:30:15.830 --> 01:30:23.200
Anthony Taylor: So form a community with your classmates. Some of you already mentioned study groups, study groups are great small class. You can have one piece.

719
01:30:23.470 --> 01:30:35.770
Anthony Taylor:  It's it's just great. I mean, just if you could do it. Great. I've had classes. There was like 6 study groups, and it was fantastic, and I've had classes where there were none, and it was still fantastic.

720
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:45.159
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it goes all different directions. We give you the ability to do it. You can meet on. Zoom your free zoom for 40 min anytime you want.

721
01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:49.050
Anthony Taylor: Alright, we don't let you use the class sale, unfortunately.

722
01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:56.769
Anthony Taylor: But I mean if you really really really wanted to, and you needed to meet, you could come to office hours, and I could throw your breakout.

723
01:30:56.980 --> 01:30:58.949
Anthony Taylor: I prefer not to, but I could

724
01:30:59.250 --> 01:31:03.779
Anthony Taylor: so there's no shortcut. There's just not. There is no easy way.

725
01:31:03.930 --> 01:31:09.639
Anthony Taylor: There was no easy way for me. There won't be an easy way for you. The good news is is unlike me. Who ever died.

726
01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:17.580
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and I'm a guide forever. When you guys connect to me on Linkedin, some of you may already have. Okay.

727
01:31:17.610 --> 01:31:22.500
Anthony Taylor: you will see. I still answer questions to students from my first co-book.

728
01:31:23.850 --> 01:31:28.219
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I still do it. I'm never gonna stop. Long as I'm around

729
01:31:28.450 --> 01:31:33.359
Anthony Taylor: you got question. I'll answer it if I can, or I'll point you in direction of where you can find it.

730
01:31:33.850 --> 01:31:36.430
Anthony Taylor: Okay. but we're gonna work.

731
01:31:36.780 --> 01:31:39.530
Anthony Taylor: Don't let that fool you. We're gonna work.

732
01:31:40.630 --> 01:31:43.449
Anthony Taylor: Okay. any questions about all that.

733
01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:59.680
Anthony Taylor: Sorry it's it's asking. It's telling me. So just so you guys know my setup to understand why I'm looking all over. I have the screen you're looking at in front of me.

734
01:32:00.150 --> 01:32:03.890
Anthony Taylor: I have a giant TV screen up here with all of your faces on.

735
01:32:04.730 --> 01:32:07.810
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then over here I have lesson plan.

736
01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:13.190
Anthony Taylor: Alright. The lesson Plan lesson plan was made by a bunch of pedagogical

737
01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:15.780
Anthony Taylor: academics. And they're wonderful.

738
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:23.809
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And they have all these really feel good things that I'm supposed to try to do. I'm not as good at the feel good things as you might think.

739
01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:26.330
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

740
01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:37.240
Anthony Taylor: yeah, I'm not doing any of those. Okay. So let's let's let's get to it. I want to talk about AI. That's why I'm here.

741
01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:39.649
Anthony Taylor: Right? Is that why we're all here?

742
01:32:39.810 --> 01:32:41.350
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So

743
01:32:41.690 --> 01:32:44.800
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna have group discussion. Now, which means

744
01:32:45.450 --> 01:32:47.469
Anthony Taylor: we're all gonna talk. Not just Anthony.

745
01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:52.030
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so I have a special tool

746
01:32:52.630 --> 01:33:02.019
Anthony Taylor: that I love to use. I have not set it up yet for you guys. but I will show it to you so that you understand what's going to happen

747
01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:04.020
Anthony Taylor: if you do not participate.

748
01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:06.690
A

749
01:33:06.990 --> 01:33:10.180
Anthony Taylor: let's go with March class.

750
01:33:11.210 --> 01:33:12.519
Anthony Taylor: So there's Mclean.

751
01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:18.420
Anthony Taylor: If you do not participate voluntarily, I will spin the wheel of doom.

752
01:33:19.740 --> 01:33:25.420
Anthony Taylor: Alright, we'll do. We'll pick. Who will volunteer to speak

753
01:33:25.870 --> 01:33:30.770
Anthony Taylor: alright. It's fun. And you saw I had a group with you. So when we do presentations.

754
01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:47.169
Anthony Taylor: we have a groups one because everybody, I always have this. We want to go first. Can we go first? No. Can we go last? No, okay, because there's always more than one group that wants to be first or last, and I don't want to play favorites. So I use the wheel of view.

755
01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:55.279
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. So anytime, I say, I'm gonna get the wheel. Somebody should quickly volunteer so that no one suffers

756
01:33:55.390 --> 01:33:58.060
Anthony Taylor: that we able to do so.

757
01:33:59.890 --> 01:34:04.759
Anthony Taylor: What's AI? What is artificial intelligence? Somebody tell me what you think.

758
01:34:05.090 --> 01:34:08.259
Anthony Taylor: Artif, I mean, you signed up for this course. You must know right.

759
01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:10.939
Anthony Taylor: Everybody knows somebody tell me

760
01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:13.530
Anthony Taylor: who wants to be the first.

761
01:34:17.810 --> 01:34:27.280
Anthony Taylor: Oh, my gosh! You gonna make me drag out the wheel on the first 10, wait, Natalie, Natalie and Brandon. They both came up same time. Who wants to go

762
01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:29.620
Anthony Taylor: wing it or brand it?

763
01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:30.920
Mckimmy, Brandon: I'll go first.

764
01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:33.839
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, alright, alright for a second.

765
01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:46.010
Mckimmy, Brandon: So I think artificial intelligence is basically tools and other machines that have been to wiped out how humans would respond. So

766
01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:51.859
Mckimmy, Brandon: if you use them, then they can think like the human, and respond that way

767
01:34:52.050 --> 01:34:53.889
Mckimmy, Brandon: to help her to assist you.

768
01:34:55.170 --> 01:34:55.980
Anthony Taylor: Sorry?

769
01:34:56.130 --> 01:34:57.930
Anthony Taylor: Alright. That's that's

770
01:34:58.090 --> 01:35:05.489
Anthony Taylor: definitely a, a a, a point of view. I like it. Anybody else want to add to that or anybody disagree with that.

771
01:35:07.630 --> 01:35:10.549
Derek Rikke: I think it's it's like computer models

772
01:35:10.670 --> 01:35:15.650
Derek Rikke: that you can train them on data so like make inferences.

773
01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:18.860
Derek Rikke: And they can do it on a level that's like a lot.

774
01:35:19.950 --> 01:35:30.060
Derek Rikke: It's like a lot more than a person could think about. I guess, and then I think they can like, reiterate, and do that over and over. and kind of like.

775
01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:32.430
Derek Rikke: take, you know, run with that. And

776
01:35:32.690 --> 01:35:34.090
Derek Rikke: I do a lot of things.

777
01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:41.789
Anthony Taylor: Alright. That's good. I like that. It's that's good. And then we're gonna we'll expand on that.

778
01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:48.520
Clayton Graves: But my understanding is that it's

779
01:35:49.260 --> 01:35:52.359
Clayton Graves: essentially like, it's a program that

780
01:35:52.690 --> 01:35:56.929
Clayton Graves: learns or teaches itself, based on parameters that you give it.

781
01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:14.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Alright, yeah, no, no, that's that, I mean. And that kind of goes with Derek said. The inference is the cool word. There, that's the word. Yes, absolutely alright. I don't. Wanna I don't want to speak too much ahead. I wanna hear everybody's thoughts before I say much.

782
01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:15.660
Anthony Taylor: Go, Sonya.

783
01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:39.740
Sonja Baro (she/hers): I think what I'm thinking of is the application of learning and being able to transfer. You know, when you say, Oh, your your skills are transferable, you know. People say that to me, I think intelligence. The artificial intelligence is when they've taken the machine learning and are able to apply that to a new parameter.

784
01:36:40.990 --> 01:36:45.829
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I like that. That's good. I like that. Okay, Meredith.

785
01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:51.710
Sonja Baro (she/hers): Oh, you're on mute. Oh, there you go!

786
01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:54.660
Anthony Taylor: Oh, no! See! What are you?

787
01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:56.579
Sonja Baro (she/hers): Are you? Oh, no.

788
01:36:56.590 --> 01:36:58.009
Sonja Baro (she/hers): we can't hear you.

789
01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:01.470
Sonja Baro (she/hers): She'll type it in chat.

790
01:37:01.810 --> 01:37:03.269
Anthony Taylor: You could do that if you wanted.

791
01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:10.180
Anthony Taylor: And having make issues.

792
01:37:11.690 --> 01:37:14.669
Anthony Taylor: she's the one that's having trouble typing.

793
01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:24.910
Anthony Taylor: I think it is as a giant search engine. That's not far from being true. Absolutely. Remember, we have more questions. So you don't all have to answer everyone. But I love it.

794
01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:40.380
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. So what is AI? So the official I'm gonna go with the curriculum people here for a second. Application. And I love that. You said it this way, an application of stealth warming technology. Look at that.

795
01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:43.969
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that this problem solved.

796
01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:50.759
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now. I'm not gonna stop it. Artificial intelligence has been around since the

797
01:37:51.060 --> 01:37:57.309
Anthony Taylor: a long time. I wanna say, the 50 sixties right in there. And you're like, what? Yeah.

798
01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:02.980
Anthony Taylor: it's been around that long machine learning is actually a subset

799
01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:07.550
Anthony Taylor: of artificial intelligence. So we hear about machine learning all the time.

800
01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:12.340
Anthony Taylor: But artificial intelligence was the grandparent of machine learning.

801
01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:22.909
Anthony Taylor: The the idea of teaching machines who teach themselves has been around for a long, long time. And do we do that today? The answer is

802
01:38:23.630 --> 01:38:24.690
Anthony Taylor: not really

803
01:38:25.990 --> 01:38:36.919
Anthony Taylor: okay. What you're seeing in these. And I'm gonna use Lms a lot only because that's what most of us are. See, may I be implemented as we're going to get away from them eventually.

804
01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:45.360
Anthony Taylor: But let's talk about them for just like cause. That's what everyone sees right when I say AI, isn't that the first thing jumps in your head for most of you.

805
01:38:45.530 --> 01:38:48.370
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, no. Does anybody think something different

806
01:38:49.410 --> 01:38:52.289
Anthony Taylor: other than bard or big chat or chetty?

807
01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:55.559
Anthony Taylor: That's what everybody's thinking. There's a lot more than that freshmen.

808
01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:58.549
Anthony Taylor: But yes, done.

809
01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:05.479
Sonja Baro (she/hers): Sorry. I didn't hear what you were saying that most of us think

810
01:39:05.670 --> 01:39:10.609
Anthony Taylor: it is. Oh, it's chat or bard, or

811
01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:18.700
Sonja Baro (she/hers): okay, yes, you said there was a term, and it didn't. Kind of was garbled.

812
01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:21.890
Sonja Baro (she/hers): LLM. As in Mary.

813
01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:27.170
Anthony Taylor: Yes, okay. Everyone needs to learn this term today. Large

814
01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:29.980
Anthony Taylor: language model.

815
01:39:31.050 --> 01:39:33.860
Sonja Baro (she/hers): large language model.

816
01:39:34.100 --> 01:39:37.090
Anthony Taylor: That is your first official. AI total.

817
01:39:38.370 --> 01:39:39.410
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

818
01:39:40.030 --> 01:39:47.120
Anthony Taylor: And that is the kind of model that powers chat, tpting chat

819
01:39:47.300 --> 01:40:01.689
Anthony Taylor: llama 2, Dolly. you want me to name someone. There's lots of okay. So anyway, that there's what really happens. So so what I would, all of this has been going on for a long time.

820
01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:07.230
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And I'm gonna give you a little history lesson real quick, probably more than you need today. But I can't help this. Alright.

821
01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:13.959
Anthony Taylor:  we were doing language, natural language processing, I mean, for years. And that's one of the

822
01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:23.139
Anthony Taylor: early things you're going to learn. This natural language process. When you see sentiment analysis, people say, well, I wonder what these words are positive or negative.

823
01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:25.370
Anthony Taylor: natural language process.

824
01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:34.709
Anthony Taylor: Okay, all kinds of. You know, anytime where we ask a computer to look at words and come to a conclusion.

825
01:40:35.530 --> 01:40:44.700
Anthony Taylor: Natural language processing. But up until a couple of years ago. Everyone pretty much looked at each word individually.

826
01:40:46.420 --> 01:40:56.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So you put in a review. It took your review. It got rid of the trash words it tried to take just the context words, and then it looked at each one in the digit.

827
01:40:58.140 --> 01:41:04.819
Anthony Taylor: Well, somebody came up with a paper. It's a famous paper, and it's it's it regards attention.

828
01:41:06.650 --> 01:41:11.290
Anthony Taylor: And the idea behind attention. Wise is, we're not. Gonna look at one word at a time anymore.

829
01:41:12.420 --> 01:41:19.690
Anthony Taylor: We now have the capability through bigger, better processing like Clayton's computers.

830
01:41:20.150 --> 01:41:22.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that we can

831
01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:27.140
Anthony Taylor: not only look at this word here, but we can look at this word next to this word.

832
01:41:27.670 --> 01:41:32.959
Anthony Taylor: and maybe next to this word, if necessary, or this word. Now we're getting bigger and bigger.

833
01:41:34.050 --> 01:41:34.990
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

834
01:41:35.170 --> 01:41:38.260
Anthony Taylor: So what do we do? Is we take these these

835
01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:43.259
Anthony Taylor: chains of words, we convert them into numbers effectively.

836
01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:52.309
Anthony Taylor: and then and and we're going to talk about how to do all that. And then we store them in a very high speed vector, database get.

837
01:41:52.630 --> 01:41:57.070
Anthony Taylor: this is high level stuff. You're gonna understand everything I'm telling you in in

838
01:41:57.420 --> 01:42:10.549
Anthony Taylor: probably 12 weeks. Okay. but we store them in there. So now, when you go ask a question. it takes the words you just asked. does the same thing, converts them into numbers.

839
01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:16.490
Anthony Taylor: looks at the data that it has, and says, you know what these numbers are similar to these numbers.

840
01:42:18.230 --> 01:42:26.530
Anthony Taylor: So let's take these numbers, see what they relate to and answer the response, convert it back into letters and answer the response.

841
01:42:27.930 --> 01:42:33.400
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's not necessarily. It's not that it learned how to answer that question.

842
01:42:33.850 --> 01:42:41.970
Anthony Taylor: We just gave it so much information that, like our own brains. we have data stored up in there. When we see something.

843
01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:47.000
Anthony Taylor: it picks up what we learned before, and we do it

844
01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:59.029
Anthony Taylor: and see. Oh, you learned it well, what is learning in that definition? It's basically taking the data and storing it in a way that makes sense contextually.

845
01:43:00.380 --> 01:43:04.080
Anthony Taylor: And that's how Llllms became what they are today.

846
01:43:04.170 --> 01:43:07.969
Anthony Taylor: Llllms at Tbt. Are being chat

847
01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:11.489
Anthony Taylor: are amazed. There's no other word for it.

848
01:43:12.750 --> 01:43:13.530
Anthony Taylor: But

849
01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:17.300
Anthony Taylor: let's continue.

850
01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:26.950
Anthony Taylor: So it's combined out page computer data, science develop algorithms that can execute autonomous problem solving. That's the official definition.

851
01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:30.090
Anthony Taylor: You do not need to remember that there is not a quiz.

852
01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:32.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

853
01:43:33.940 --> 01:43:45.930
Anthony Taylor: so what are some applications? Self-driving cars? How good are those? How many of you have one of those cars you can let go at a wheel and just drive. You have one of those I have one of those Michael's like, hey? Damn! I'm a truck guy.

854
01:43:47.210 --> 01:43:50.840
Anthony Taylor: right? Anybody else have one that you could do that now.

855
01:43:51.330 --> 01:43:58.929
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I do. I have a truck, and I can let go on a wheel. And I have. My wife has a car. We can let go on the wheel, and it'll turn, and everything.

856
01:43:59.730 --> 01:44:03.389
Anthony Taylor: Okay scares the Jesus out of me. I won't do.

857
01:44:03.650 --> 01:44:06.429
Anthony Taylor: Won't let it. I let. Hey, look at this.

858
01:44:09.670 --> 01:44:16.660
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that was good. That's that's good. That's fine. Right? That's exactly how it looks. Okay. New

859
01:44:17.570 --> 01:44:24.219
Anthony Taylor: We will talk about self-driving cars, how they work, how we train them. We're obviously not gonna train a self-driving car in class. We got that.

860
01:44:24.710 --> 01:44:29.449
Anthony Taylor: But that cool. But I can tell you exactly how it's treated, how it works. Why, it doesn't work.

861
01:44:30.670 --> 01:44:34.019
Anthony Taylor: Okay, will they fix it? 100%? Yes.

862
01:44:34.410 --> 01:44:36.299
Anthony Taylor: eventually. Someday.

863
01:44:37.170 --> 01:44:39.000
Anthony Taylor: the biggest problem is vision.

864
01:44:39.580 --> 01:44:41.919
Anthony Taylor: the decision making pretty good.

865
01:44:42.220 --> 01:44:44.019
Anthony Taylor: The vision is the problem

866
01:44:44.710 --> 01:44:54.329
Anthony Taylor: for the same reason that. And we're gonna talk about this later, when we talk about how machine learning models and AI are sometimes biased.

867
01:44:55.290 --> 01:44:57.980
Anthony Taylor: They particularly like guys that look like me.

868
01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:00.780
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

869
01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:05.589
Anthony Taylor: But that's not because they're, you know somebody bad did it?

870
01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:08.490
Anthony Taylor: It's because that's the data they were given

871
01:45:09.980 --> 01:45:18.810
Anthony Taylor: alright. The other thing about that is is when it comes to vision. My face has a lot of contrast, don't you think?

872
01:45:19.870 --> 01:45:32.880
Anthony Taylor: Especially when I dye all the gray up? Very contrary. Okay. darker faces like, look at Kevin right now. He's kind of back in the shade. I don't even think Kevin had no stay there.

873
01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:39.719
Anthony Taylor: See? Yeah, no contrast. Can you make out all of his features? We kind of can, because our eyes can see it.

874
01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:45.960
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But computers don't understand it. What they see is a big, dark spot.

875
01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:47.980
what they see.

876
01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:55.049
Anthony Taylor: We're getting better every. I'm not gonna say day. But we're getting better every site

877
01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:57.509
Anthony Taylor: of the technology. We are getting better.

878
01:45:57.860 --> 01:46:00.939
And that's why I like the new Google pixel phones.

879
01:46:01.090 --> 01:46:05.390
Anthony Taylor: Right? They they brag about how well they can take

880
01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:09.289
Anthony Taylor: pictures of every skin tone.

881
01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:14.509
Anthony Taylor: Why would they brag about that? Well, because that's new technology

882
01:46:15.550 --> 01:46:23.850
Anthony Taylor: pretty amazing when you think about it. So self-driving cars have a different contrast problem. You know what their problem is, what color are lions on the road.

883
01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:25.700
Anthony Taylor: When there are lines

884
01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:29.649
Anthony Taylor: they're white. What color is snow.

885
01:46:30.980 --> 01:46:32.130
Anthony Taylor: whites?

886
01:46:34.170 --> 01:46:37.289
I teach it to find a lane when there is no lane.

887
01:46:38.290 --> 01:46:43.579
Anthony Taylor: right? There's all kinds of problems with them. But that's one of the big ones that they're working on all the time. Okay.

888
01:46:44.110 --> 01:46:55.190
Anthony Taylor: Roomba, how many of you have a roomba rhubas are fun. They're really cool. My, my cat people. You put your camera on it. It'll ride around. It's it's best use ever.

889
01:46:55.720 --> 01:47:00.489
Anthony Taylor: Okay, they're pretty cool. I like them, but that is AI. It's well.

890
01:47:00.690 --> 01:47:05.380
Anthony Taylor: The more advanced ones are the old ones. They run into a wall they turn. That's not am

891
01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:16.730
Anthony Taylor: okay. Generative. AI, that's Llm spark, big chat. Basically generative. AI means I am going to generate an answer from your prompt

892
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:20.560
Anthony Taylor: is no longer a question. It is a prompt

893
01:47:22.590 --> 01:47:23.620
Anthony Taylor: okay.

894
01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:27.929
Anthony Taylor: you'll hear. Recall the question, but officially the terms prompt.

895
01:47:28.090 --> 01:47:30.809
Anthony Taylor: How many of you have heard of the job? Prompt engineer?

896
01:47:32.330 --> 01:47:36.699
Anthony Taylor: Couple of you prompt engineers are making easy 6 figures.

897
01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:38.920
good ones.

898
01:47:39.060 --> 01:47:42.280
Anthony Taylor: What is a prompt engineer? Somebody wants to ask that question right?

899
01:47:42.410 --> 01:47:48.980
Anthony Taylor: A prompt engineer is a person that knows how to ask an Llm. A question in a way to get the answer.

900
01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:53.249
Anthony Taylor: The best answer that's a prompt in you.

901
01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:57.940
Anthony Taylor: Some prompts can be hundreds of lines long

902
01:47:59.220 --> 01:48:01.929
Anthony Taylor: be like, well, what's prompt? Again, prompt is a question.

903
01:48:03.610 --> 01:48:11.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. But we're gonna do all that we definitely are. Gonna do that. Recommendation algorithms on social media streaming sites.

904
01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:19.960
Anthony Taylor: These algorithms. I mean, there, there's a really simple way to do recommendation engines called clustering. We're gonna cover that couple weeks.

905
01:48:20.130 --> 01:48:20.920
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

906
01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:26.390
Anthony Taylor: the the using AI, we can get a lot better with recommendation agents

907
01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:31.870
Anthony Taylor: in the old days. They basically, said Meredith. She likes these 20 movies

908
01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:38.400
Anthony Taylor: and Tanya watched one of those 20 movies. So let's assume that Tanya wants to watch everything. Meredith watched.

909
01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:42.390
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so let's suggest all emeritus movies to time.

910
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:50.149
Anthony Taylor: Worked. Netflix made a fortune off of that view. Okay, but now it's getting way smarter

911
01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:51.860
Anthony Taylor: way smarter.

912
01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:56.679
Anthony Taylor: It even looks at like how long you watch. How many times you pause it.

913
01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:01.940
Anthony Taylor: Stuff like that. It's like crazy. Some of the stuff they look at now actually.

914
01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:10.690
Anthony Taylor: braggart, bragging Bragg. I like to brag. I actually wrote a lot of the curriculum for Netflix's intern course

915
01:49:11.070 --> 01:49:14.999
Anthony Taylor: through to you or Edx. I don't know what we're called this week.

916
01:49:15.570 --> 01:49:16.709
Anthony Taylor: Think we're to you.

917
01:49:16.980 --> 01:49:19.480
Anthony Taylor: So next question for the class.

918
01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:21.049
Anthony Taylor: what is machine learning?

919
01:49:27.290 --> 01:49:28.230
Anthony Taylor: Nobody

920
01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.110
Anthony Taylor: seems like we covered it right? Yeah, maybe, Clinton.

921
01:49:34.420 --> 01:49:41.340
Clayton Graves: So that's where you give it a set of parameters, and it absolutely teaches itself.

922
01:49:42.370 --> 01:49:53.060
Anthony Taylor: Well, it identifies patterns. Machine learning is more about identifying patterns. But yes, it looks at those patterns, and it says, oh, well, when these things happen.

923
01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:54.700
Anthony Taylor: this is the answer.

924
01:49:55.060 --> 01:50:07.750
Anthony Taylor: when these things happen, this is the answer, and so on. And so machine learning is much more black and white. There's still a lot of fuzzy year, because what you're going to find is no matter how good you are and how good your date is.

925
01:50:07.830 --> 01:50:13.549
Anthony Taylor: there's not always an algorithm that will match it perfectly. So we'll talk about what's acceptable.

926
01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:16.919
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Well, we're gonna do for the first

927
01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:18.240
Anthony Taylor: month.

928
01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:23.760
Anthony Taylor: maybe 2 months. Actually, we're gonna do nothing but machinery.

929
01:50:23.980 --> 01:50:30.359
Anthony Taylor: Well, first, I'm gonna teach you how to code. I think we're gonna do cheap.  it's a lot of fun.

930
01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:43.039
Anthony Taylor: So the official answer, machine learning is a subset of AI that enables computer algorithms to learn from data and make decisions or predictions about future data without explicit instructions from programs.

931
01:50:43.450 --> 01:50:48.139
Anthony Taylor: It's learning adults. It's all it's looking.

932
01:50:49.340 --> 01:50:52.329
Anthony Taylor: This. I have been doing the last 10,

933
01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:56.940
Anthony Taylor: and it's fun. It's exciting. It is not nearly as cool as you think.

934
01:50:57.910 --> 01:51:00.660
Anthony Taylor: But you're gonna learn.

935
01:51:01.290 --> 01:51:08.889
Anthony Taylor:  alright. So without the I, 8 of AI programmers must provide a computer with all of the rules.

936
01:51:10.020 --> 01:51:11.030
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

937
01:51:11.060 --> 01:51:15.280
Anthony Taylor: and this is both time consuming and inefficient. Ml differs

938
01:51:15.690 --> 01:51:31.129
Anthony Taylor: because it creates predictive models and then uses them to make predictions. Ml, uses algorithms to craft and trade models, make predictions on data from the world around us. The key there, I want to predict if you will default on alone.

939
01:51:33.090 --> 01:51:35.999
Anthony Taylor: hey? I'm going to look at.

940
01:51:36.130 --> 01:51:44.559
Anthony Taylor: However many factors I've I've got available to me, and hopefully, with some degree of accuracy, I can get it right

941
01:51:45.010 --> 01:51:47.689
Anthony Taylor: and know if I, if you are.

942
01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:49.380
Anthony Taylor: know with enough

943
01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:57.000
Anthony Taylor: accuracy that I feel comfortable, saying, No, you cannot have that cause. I make money. You take the look.

944
01:51:57.180 --> 01:52:02.399
Anthony Taylor: I lose money or whatever I have a headache if you don't, if you take it and then default.

945
01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:04.480
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

946
01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:08.389
Anthony Taylor: so email, we're gonna do that, we're gonna do lots of that

947
01:52:08.530 --> 01:52:16.310
Anthony Taylor: in the beginning, because you need those skills to be able to do the AI stuff we're gonna do later.

948
01:52:16.890 --> 01:52:21.500
Anthony Taylor: So we're kind of like starting inside of AI and going to work out to bigger

949
01:52:21.610 --> 01:52:22.390
Anthony Taylor: picture.

950
01:52:22.540 --> 01:52:30.359
Anthony Taylor: AI enables computer algorithm to perform tasks in a way similar to human, while in ML. Enables an algorithm to create its own intelligence.

951
01:52:30.930 --> 01:52:38.050
Anthony Taylor: I don't know like that. But basically it makes sense in the sense that you know.

952
01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:45.730
Anthony Taylor: this is based on appearances. This quote.

953
01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:50.710
Anthony Taylor: okay, when you talk to how everyone here has used Chat Gp.

954
01:52:50.730 --> 01:52:53.440
Anthony Taylor: or big chat, anyone? Not

955
01:52:54.030 --> 01:53:02.459
Anthony Taylor: okay, Sonya. I would love for you to like, go to bing, chat or something, and try it out in the next day or 2. Michael. You haven't used it.

956
01:53:03.980 --> 01:53:09.390
Anthony Taylor: No, really. Okay, try it. Just go in there and ask, not not participate

957
01:53:09.420 --> 01:53:13.080
Anthony Taylor: like they. You're just asking some crazy question.

958
01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:17.420
michael mcpherson: I've used the art ones. Those are fun.

959
01:53:17.690 --> 01:53:26.400
Anthony Taylor: Okay, like Dolly, or bid journey all of those. Yeah, if you have chat. Tbt. it now includes

960
01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:29.580
Anthony Taylor: Dolly 3, and it's ridiculous.

961
01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:32.850
Anthony Taylor: I was doing mid journey. I canceled my mid journey when I saw them.

962
01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:40.279
Anthony Taylor: It's like Holy Moly. I do just go in there and start talking to just ask it some cool question.

963
01:53:40.330 --> 01:53:49.799
Anthony Taylor: but not. Don't be too generic like. Ask it, like, you know. I have some hamburger and pickles. Give me a recipe.

964
01:53:50.350 --> 01:53:51.120
Anthony Taylor: you will.

965
01:53:51.330 --> 01:53:54.750
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and then it'll ask you questions. It'll talk to you.

966
01:53:54.900 --> 01:53:57.819
Anthony Taylor: and it'll feel like you're talking to a human. Yeah. But

967
01:54:00.620 --> 01:54:02.449
Clayton Graves: so I used

968
01:54:02.530 --> 01:54:15.190
Clayton Graves: chat Gp exclusively tell myself to help me find a job. So I there you go. I would take my resume, and I would take the job description, and I would ask it to compare the 2,

969
01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:32.279
Clayton Graves: and it would tell me you know wh what my resume was missing, or what I could enhance, and so I would do that repeatedly, over and over and over again, until I got it to be happy with with my resume for that particular description, and that's how I would send off my resumes.

970
01:54:32.970 --> 01:54:34.290
Anthony Taylor: That's fantastic.

971
01:54:34.300 --> 01:54:41.059
Sonja Baro (she/hers): Wait! And you just you saved yourself. I don't know. It's 80 bucks for a month of job scan

972
01:54:54.570 --> 01:54:59.400
Sonja Baro (she/hers): show. You guys one thing, and I will give you guys this, here we go.

973
01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:01.960
Anthony Taylor: So this is a prompt.

974
01:55:02.490 --> 01:55:07.530
Anthony Taylor: So this is chatty. Pt, this is that part of the cricket team. But I'm gonna show you. So

975
01:55:07.790 --> 01:55:10.529
Anthony Taylor: this is a prop that was created.

976
01:55:10.610 --> 01:55:17.290
Anthony Taylor: You're a tutor, AI, a college professor has a Ph. D. Mastery, bachelor degree, or subject degree in all possible fields.

977
01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:25.039
Anthony Taylor: Because of this, all lessons that you feature very high quality, often combining concepts, series facts, information from other relevant fields.

978
01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:26.290
Anthony Taylor: Sounds interesting.

979
01:55:26.650 --> 01:55:29.220
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this prompt goes on.

980
01:55:30.830 --> 01:55:35.190
Anthony Taylor: And when you run this it will give you

981
01:55:35.210 --> 01:55:38.210
Anthony Taylor: this menu. What would you like to focus on today.

982
01:55:38.860 --> 01:55:41.720
Anthony Taylor: sir. Anthem. Okay?

983
01:55:41.740 --> 01:55:47.289
Anthony Taylor: And I said, I want to learn data bricks. Now, just so you guys know, you guys don't know this yet. I am like a data bricks.

984
01:55:47.970 --> 01:55:49.400
Anthony Taylor: Guru, expert guide.

985
01:55:49.590 --> 01:55:56.110
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But I wanted to see what they came up. So first it comes up with a lesson plan

986
01:55:57.130 --> 01:56:00.969
Anthony Taylor: and links. You can go learn from that lesson plan.

987
01:56:01.810 --> 01:56:09.619
Anthony Taylor: Alright. And then I go. Oh, I didn't do it. Okay, hold on the other cool thing about chat TV, it'll remember. So I can say,

988
01:56:09.780 --> 01:56:11.290
Anthony Taylor: let's learn

989
01:56:13.480 --> 01:56:18.499
Anthony Taylor: hopefully, it hasn't forgotten. That would be fun. Learn lesson 2

990
01:56:24.610 --> 01:56:31.250
Anthony Taylor: getting started with data bricks. So let's see if that was right. Yup, getting started with data, bricks, Workspace. And there you go.

991
01:56:32.490 --> 01:56:44.100
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so this is one thing you can do with something like this. You can see there's I have all kinds. I have stuff that we were doing for this class. Ai course components.

992
01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:52.130
Anthony Taylor: I my, my not telling you this to bum you out. But my brother died. We go 2 weeks ago.

993
01:56:52.270 --> 01:56:56.650
Anthony Taylor: and I wrote his eulogy using Chat TV.

994
01:56:58.150 --> 01:57:04.819
Anthony Taylor: Okay, sounds horrible. But I mean, I'm not gonna make it. But I put in all this information.

995
01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:07.790
Anthony Taylor: and it came up with a fantastic

996
01:57:07.970 --> 01:57:14.000
Anthony Taylor: post and speech. I wanted to know what to cook with the pork Chloe I had in the freezer.

997
01:57:16.190 --> 01:57:17.139
Anthony Taylor: There you go.

998
01:57:18.460 --> 01:57:19.200
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

999
01:57:19.330 --> 01:57:24.820
Anthony Taylor: It's amazing how I went from a eulogy to pork, Lloyd recipe

1000
01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:27.450
Anthony Taylor: alright. So anyway.

1001
01:57:28.570 --> 01:57:35.360
Anthony Taylor: this is Chat. Tbt, I would love to see you guys chat. TV itself is free. What you're seeing on my screen is not free.

1002
01:57:35.450 --> 01:57:46.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I'm using the paid version. It's like 20 bucks a month or something, and it is amazing. But this real quick. You also have a corner of your bing.

1003
01:57:47.130 --> 01:57:51.429
Anthony Taylor: They call it co-pilot with big chat. This is exactly the same thing.

1004
01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:59.200
Anthony Taylor: Give me recipe or Lasagna. Since Tanya has brought this up.

1005
01:57:59.720 --> 01:58:04.410
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Or Sonia, who's like those I can remember. Now I'm here. Sonia brought him

1006
01:58:04.770 --> 01:58:10.479
Anthony Taylor: right. And then there you go. Simple. I know it. Just Google. It. Right? Yeah, sort of

1007
01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:16.790
Anthony Taylor: okay. But I could ask another question. You know what? Stop responding.

1008
01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:20.950
Anthony Taylor: I am lactose. intolerant.

1009
01:58:23.330 --> 01:58:29.080
Anthony Taylor: Now, I didn't have to go in and say, yeah, I didn't like re-ask the question

1010
01:58:30.030 --> 01:58:33.270
Anthony Taylor: and look, it says, I'm sorry to hear that here are some tips

1011
01:58:34.220 --> 01:58:40.659
Anthony Taylor: alright, and it'll give me that, and then I can say, actually, it is going to make me ask again, which is because I stopped generating.

1012
01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:44.489
Anthony Taylor:  give me a recipe

1013
01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:46.530
Anthony Taylor: for Lasagna.

1014
01:58:49.070 --> 01:58:54.500
Anthony Taylor: That is lactose. Okay, I know it kind of feels like Google. And the way I'm showing you.

1015
01:58:54.640 --> 01:58:59.839
Anthony Taylor: But there's more to it than it will talk to you. It will give you where you can go

1016
01:58:59.890 --> 01:59:02.730
Anthony Taylor: all of this stuff. Okay?

1017
01:59:03.940 --> 01:59:06.319
Anthony Taylor: And it'll work every single time.

1018
01:59:07.390 --> 01:59:19.109
Anthony Taylor: And it's not doing this because it has a database filled with everything on the planet. It has a database filled with vectors and words and context so that it can go. Huh!

1019
01:59:19.190 --> 01:59:24.640
Anthony Taylor: I can find that that fits into this group and this group and this group. Boom, here's your answer.

1020
01:59:25.470 --> 01:59:37.050
Sonja Baro (she/hers): There's more to it than that. But that's a basic description on that. Is. So. This reminds me. I've I've heard that a lot of ways that computers save

1021
01:59:37.130 --> 02:00:01.969
Sonja Baro (she/hers): the memory and not consume at all at once, is by painting just what you need to know or displaying just what needs to be displayed. At that moment. So it doesn't generate the entire like. Let's say you're doing a a VR or a visualization of a room, or whatever. And just as you're moving, then it's pulling at that point

1022
02:00:02.110 --> 02:00:07.470
Sonja Baro (she/hers): is that kind of what's happening here or there. Absolutely can't I mean.

1023
02:00:07.550 --> 02:00:15.220
Anthony Taylor: no, that's not what's happening here, and I'll show you what I'll show you this. So here, if we go. And we just go to being. And we type in this. This is, you know, like Google.

1024
02:00:15.230 --> 02:00:17.389
Anthony Taylor: we could've done this in Google, we're gonna get.

1025
02:00:17.890 --> 02:00:24.769
Anthony Taylor: just, you know, 4 pages. How many I don't know. Google tells you how many results. But there's a thousand

1026
02:00:24.900 --> 02:00:27.170
Anthony Taylor: okay, thousands of results.

1027
02:00:27.180 --> 02:00:35.479
Anthony Taylor: What it does is it literally goes. And you can see it's been searching for alright. And if we look at this, we'll probably find.

1028
02:00:35.660 --> 02:00:37.340
Sonja Baro (she/hers): you know, wanna have, like the first one.

1029
02:00:37.510 --> 02:00:42.620
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. And it's not but the chat engines, these Lms and stuff. They don't return like

1030
02:00:43.100 --> 02:00:44.430
Anthony Taylor: values of data.

1031
02:00:44.550 --> 02:00:54.609
Anthony Taylor: Okay, they return. They try to answer your question. Now I could come in here and look and see what are some other? Can I use chicken instead of B? How do I store Leftover

1032
02:00:55.260 --> 02:00:59.660
Anthony Taylor: right? It's suggesting ways to continue the conversation.

1033
02:00:59.750 --> 02:01:04.560
Anthony Taylor: or you can just ask for something else, and it'll continue it that way.

1034
02:01:04.660 --> 02:01:15.709
Anthony Taylor:  you could say, how about another? How about another? How about another? How about another? And eventually it'll go through all of them. Okay. But anyway, no, it is not caching into

1035
02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:20.710
Anthony Taylor: that is the answer. It is spewing out the answer that it takes. You want to hear.

1036
02:01:21.620 --> 02:01:23.490
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So

1037
02:01:24.620 --> 02:01:28.249
Anthony Taylor: let's continue a little bit further, because I have something I just can't wait to tell you.

1038
02:01:28.390 --> 02:01:32.909
Anthony Taylor:  narrow. AI, this is this is basically what you just saw.

1039
02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:37.130
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's very specific to what you ask it.

1040
02:01:37.270 --> 02:01:46.320
Anthony Taylor: It. It really can't share. And that arguable these days with what we call agents, which you guys are going to learn.

1041
02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:52.120
Anthony Taylor: an agent is basically me taking an Llm. Api

1042
02:01:52.180 --> 02:01:54.190
Anthony Taylor: and giving it a personality

1043
02:01:54.970 --> 02:02:00.270
Anthony Taylor: and then taking another one, giving it a personality and then making them work together.

1044
02:02:02.140 --> 02:02:09.690
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And they do. That's the crazy part. They'll talk to each other. They'll correct each other. Then we'll make each other better.

1045
02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:17.520
Anthony Taylor: Now imagine, if you could do this, you know, with 50 of them. all of them talking to each other. And we are. That's what we're doing.

1046
02:02:17.870 --> 02:02:27.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we may not do that in class. It's kind of hard to do in class, because you need a lot of computers. Let's borrow some  Do you have a quantum one over there, Clayton?

1047
02:02:29.910 --> 02:02:33.560
Anthony Taylor: You only have. You have the big supercomputers, but no quantum ones.

1048
02:02:35.350 --> 02:02:38.079
Anthony Taylor: You're muted, Buddy. I was still looking forward.

1049
02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:50.160
Clayton Graves: Grief. I couldn't find the same thing. I'm not doing quantum computers. But doing.

1050
02:02:50.450 --> 02:03:07.910
Clayton Graves: We're we're doing clusters that can consist of upwards tens of thousands of individual nodes which are are individual computing units. All right. So think of a note is like your laptop, or something like that. But all of these are working together.

1051
02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:09.550
Clayton Graves: and to

1052
02:03:09.650 --> 02:03:15.880
Clayton Graves: perform whatever task you ask it to do across all of those computers simultaneously

1053
02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:28.510
Clayton Graves: weather prediction stock market government encryption decryption. You name it AI as well.

1054
02:03:28.860 --> 02:03:38.280
Anthony Taylor: I don't. I don't. So there! There's a technology that I use every day called Spark. Where we do. II spit up clusters of

1055
02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:57.159
Anthony Taylor: I don't know 5 to 12 computers every day, just for general work. And then everyone saw we have jobs that they, you know, a few 100 at a time, and it's just a push of a button these days is so cool, tens of thousands of liquid, cool computers

1056
02:03:57.910 --> 02:03:59.250
Clayton Graves: all working together.

1057
02:04:00.910 --> 02:04:05.010
Anthony Taylor: cool, alright so. And and we do have another. Everyone do

1058
02:04:05.370 --> 02:04:13.880
Anthony Taylor: and this everyone do again is all of us in the same room, like I said, lots of Anthony talking today that don't get used to it, I mean, well, do. But

1059
02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:15.840
Anthony Taylor: it won't be this much.

1060
02:04:15.950 --> 02:04:24.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So here we go. First question. what does AI need you? Why do the port so we've already kind of talked about what it ties to.

1061
02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:32.960
Anthony Taylor: But does anybody like have any like strong feelings about how it is, what it is, how they think it could go, Clayton.

1062
02:04:37.490 --> 02:04:41.620
Clayton Graves: I think, it, at least for for me personally.

1063
02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:50.270
Clayton Graves: a lot of what I do for a living is going to be performable by an a I at some point in the future.

1064
02:04:50.370 --> 02:04:51.440
Clayton Graves: and

1065
02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:55.949
Clayton Graves: I want to learn how to

1066
02:04:56.080 --> 02:05:01.069
Clayton Graves: support the AI, so that I can stay employed when it does replace me.

1067
02:05:01.290 --> 02:05:05.519
Anthony Taylor: So so you you want to be the AI support.

1068
02:05:05.650 --> 02:05:07.800
Clayton Graves: I personally.

1069
02:05:07.970 --> 02:05:15.709
Clayton Graves: I, for one welcome our artificial overlords. I I can do for them to make their lives easier.

1070
02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:20.850
Clayton Graves: I'm good. My job is to fix the Terminator 9,000,

1071
02:05:21.510 --> 02:05:34.659
Anthony Taylor: and that's a great way to put it. I like that. What I want you to. I'm gonna ask you to go a bit higher goal, though I want you to learn to train that AI

1072
02:05:34.750 --> 02:05:36.110
Anthony Taylor: to do your job.

1073
02:05:37.180 --> 02:05:40.989
Clayton Graves: Okay, you're the boss.

1074
02:05:41.160 --> 02:05:45.879
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Alright, I like that. That's our goal is to train it

1075
02:05:45.900 --> 02:05:49.170
Anthony Taylor: so that we're not bossed by it. We own it.

1076
02:05:49.290 --> 02:05:57.240
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So anybody would answer, what about AI interest you? I mean, some of you hadn't even used. Lolm, so this is pretty exciting.

1077
02:05:57.780 --> 02:06:02.739
Anthony Taylor: You should be like what that can do that. Yes. and so much more.

1078
02:06:04.110 --> 02:06:08.040
Anthony Taylor: No, nobody has an interest. It's okay. go ahead, Jennifer.

1079
02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:19.209
Jennifer Dahlgren: I think what interests me most is the fact that a I can do the basics. So if you think of Maslov's hierarchy, you have. You know your basic needs met.

1080
02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:34.999
Jennifer Dahlgren: I can actually go up to the next level and learn things that are different that normally I wouldn't have to concern myself with, and so exactly so. Now I am learning from it to be a better person.

1081
02:06:36.210 --> 02:06:38.060
Anthony Taylor: I like it. I like it.

1082
02:06:38.090 --> 02:06:52.879
Clayton Graves: There's an existential one there, too, when you're trying to define what consciousness consciousness is. While you're training this thing. II think that's fascinating.

1083
02:06:54.140 --> 02:06:56.030
Anthony Taylor: It's true. It's true.

1084
02:06:56.230 --> 02:07:00.859
Anthony Taylor: Did somebody leave. I hope nobody left. Wait, there's chat messages.

1085
02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:04.030
Anthony Taylor: anyway. Okay.

1086
02:07:04.070 --> 02:07:08.370
Anthony Taylor:  were we?

1087
02:07:08.450 --> 02:07:10.740
Anthony Taylor: yes, Rodney, what's up?

1088
02:07:11.910 --> 02:07:29.670
Rodney Simba Masarirambi: Just to II really like Jennifer's answer. There. And one of the things that I kind of like about it as well is that not only are you taking a look at like like you look at the things on the higher plane and doing those things that you didn't have time for. But it's also the possibility of

1089
02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:40.350
Rodney Simba Masarirambi: wh everything that we're looking at right now. Seems to me like it's very basic, like the things that allowing people seem like it's like stuff that

1090
02:07:40.610 --> 02:07:49.350
Rodney Simba Masarirambi: you could figure a way around, and I'm kind of looking at it as that. There's stuff that we haven't thought of, and things that we haven't yet

1091
02:07:49.530 --> 02:08:00.289
Rodney Simba Masarirambi:  thought about, which we can use AI for and being on the ground level and being able to shape, that is like, that's what to me, seems the most interesting part of this.

1092
02:08:02.060 --> 02:08:08.910
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I love that. That's a great answer. They made me bring up something that I want to show you some. Am I anybody here? Work with sap.

1093
02:08:11.060 --> 02:08:13.970
Anthony Taylor: Okay, good. So does anybody know what abap is?

1094
02:08:15.130 --> 02:08:24.540
Anthony Taylor: It's the programming language behind sap. If you wanted to customize your sap installation, you would hire a very expensive, a bat developer.

1095
02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:31.480
Anthony Taylor: and they would develop code that only 4 people can read. Okay, well, one of my gigs.

1096
02:08:32.490 --> 02:08:36.239
Anthony Taylor: we needed to convert that abap into what's called spark seaboard

1097
02:08:36.350 --> 02:08:44.950
Anthony Taylor: way faster way cheaper. So I just went to chat Tpp and I gave it the abap. What you see, and on the screen. There, that's the abap.

1098
02:08:46.010 --> 02:08:52.259
Anthony Taylor: and it converted it to Sparc's equal. Now we would have paid a consultant.

1099
02:08:52.550 --> 02:09:02.260
Anthony Taylor: probably about $350 an hour for a couple of weeks to do what this did in a few seconds. So it's not just simple stuff. That's what's cool about.

1100
02:09:02.730 --> 02:09:16.219
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's not just I, the demos. I'm giving you a kind of simple so far. But I mean, when we talk about like aes encryption and spark. I mean, these are very complex things. Now, can it go and get deep?

1101
02:09:16.730 --> 02:09:23.839
Anthony Taylor: Well, I mean, if you ran my, this one here. Yeah, it can get deep, but it's all it's cop. It's

1102
02:09:24.020 --> 02:09:25.819
Anthony Taylor: this is where that whole

1103
02:09:26.090 --> 02:09:30.459
Anthony Taylor: the comment. Oh, you know what I'll never find it but

1104
02:09:30.620 --> 02:09:40.899
Anthony Taylor: like and I'll just do this real quick. I'm gonna do a new chat. I'm gonna say, write a letter to my friend.

1105
02:09:42.310 --> 02:09:45.670
Anthony Taylor: Sorry I was looking at screen Friend Brandon.

1106
02:09:46.670 --> 02:09:52.440
Anthony Taylor:  letting him know I am glad he is taking

1107
02:09:52.500 --> 02:09:56.330
Anthony Taylor: and aibcamp.

1108
02:09:58.100 --> 02:10:02.789
Anthony Taylor: and that's it. Let's just start with that. And I hit enter. And it's gonna give me a nice link.

1109
02:10:03.420 --> 02:10:08.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay. now. that's cool. Good starting.

1110
02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:10.700
Anthony Taylor: Alright, it's kind of fun.

1111
02:10:11.830 --> 02:10:20.040
Anthony Taylor: And it's a good letter. You guys reading that letter, field AI is booming and an interesting domain will open up a myriad of opportunities for you.

1112
02:10:22.550 --> 02:10:23.839
Anthony Taylor: Now, here's my favorite thing.

1113
02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:28.410
Anthony Taylor: Write this

1114
02:10:28.550 --> 02:10:30.170
Anthony Taylor: and the style

1115
02:10:31.180 --> 02:10:32.550
Anthony Taylor: of Dr. Seuss.

1116
02:10:37.310 --> 02:10:39.359
Anthony Taylor: And then just like that. Yeah.

1117
02:10:40.060 --> 02:10:46.660
Anthony Taylor: write this as a wrap in the style

1118
02:10:47.580 --> 02:10:52.320
Anthony Taylor: of LL, cool. J, and just like that. If you do that.

1119
02:10:56.690 --> 02:11:02.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay, the thing that's interesting about this is that with the Llm. In particular.

1120
02:11:03.120 --> 02:11:08.250
Anthony Taylor: they have so much information in them. so much available to us.

1121
02:11:08.510 --> 02:11:11.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And I mean they.

1122
02:11:12.830 --> 02:11:14.579
Anthony Taylor: There is no.

1123
02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:23.120
Anthony Taylor: the only limit right now is what's available. Well, these were trained on the Internet. the entire Internet

1124
02:11:24.910 --> 02:11:27.799
Anthony Taylor: trillions of tokens.

1125
02:11:28.120 --> 02:11:31.109
Anthony Taylor: What's a token? Token is effectively a word.

1126
02:11:32.220 --> 02:11:34.700
Anthony Taylor: trillions of words.

1127
02:11:34.870 --> 02:11:36.030
Anthony Taylor: Yes, Mary.

1128
02:11:38.370 --> 02:11:40.859
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I think I fixed my mic. Can you hear me now?

1129
02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:46.440
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I can hear you now. And so, following up on.

1130
02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:50.000
Meredith McCanse (she/her): you would ask, like, What does AI mean to you?

1131
02:11:50.460 --> 02:12:03.759
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I will admit there's aspects of it that I find really creepy and kind of dangerous. Ii saw an app. Someone shared a video with me the other day. It was. It's an app where someone can speak into it for like 30 s.

1132
02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:05.330
Meredith McCanse (she/her): and then it will.

1133
02:12:05.340 --> 02:12:22.400
Meredith McCanse (she/her): and then convert it to another language. So then, and it showed this. So this person spoke for 30 s in English, and then it showed it in German, and then it showed it in French, and but not only did it translate it, but it also adjusted the video, so his lips and mouth were moving

1134
02:12:22.550 --> 02:12:33.760
Meredith McCanse (she/her): according to whatever language it was, and it was seamless like you it was. You couldn't tell the difference which is awesome, and there's so many applications for that. But also it begs the question.

1135
02:12:33.780 --> 02:12:45.520
Meredith McCanse (she/her): It will become very hard to tell what's real and what's generated, and the volume of misinformation out there that could be used for all sorts of nefarious things.

1136
02:12:45.790 --> 02:12:48.770
Meredith McCanse (she/her): It seems like that's a whole can of worms.

1137
02:12:56.540 --> 02:13:01.429
Anthony Taylor: Okay, deep fakes are a real thing. And now they're just easier than ever to do

1138
02:13:01.630 --> 02:13:08.610
Anthony Taylor: right? Right? And and that's that's what I mean, what what you said wasn't exactly same technology.

1139
02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:12.590
Anthony Taylor: Basically, what happens is the computer goes in and maps the face

1140
02:13:12.950 --> 02:13:26.260
Anthony Taylor: and maps the expressions and then translates the words and comes up with how that expression could look for each syllable. Okay, so it's crazy. And you're right. And there are a lot of ethical concerns with that.

1141
02:13:26.410 --> 02:13:30.929
Anthony Taylor: with all of it, not just deep fakes. But I mean, basically you. You described it fake.

1142
02:13:31.090 --> 02:13:33.790
Anthony Taylor: I don't usually bring up deep faith before drop date.

1143
02:13:33.970 --> 02:13:36.160
Anthony Taylor: But I just did. So.

1144
02:13:36.190 --> 02:13:38.020
Anthony Taylor: There you go. This is real.

1145
02:13:38.330 --> 02:13:40.570
Anthony Taylor: anyway. Yes, madam.

1146
02:13:41.380 --> 02:13:50.749
Natalie Mason: is there a a field that will be preventing those types of things from happening?

1147
02:13:52.630 --> 02:13:54.420
Anthony Taylor: It is possible. Okay.

1148
02:13:54.960 --> 02:14:00.859
Anthony Taylor: today. It's pretty easy to tell a deep fake video frame from a non deep fake video frame.

1149
02:14:01.540 --> 02:14:13.820
Anthony Taylor: You can't necessarily tell what it was so like. If I put Nicholas Cage's face over Tom screws face in an MI seat. Okay, you'll know it's Nicholas Gage, and that's not him.

1150
02:14:14.370 --> 02:14:18.390
Anthony Taylor: all right, but you may not be able to tell who it should be.

1151
02:14:19.400 --> 02:14:27.130
Anthony Taylor:  at the photo level they're getting. It's getting really, really hard to tell.

1152
02:14:27.990 --> 02:14:32.960
Anthony Taylor: Okay, at the photo level, they can blend the pixels in such a way that it looks natural.

1153
02:14:33.490 --> 02:14:40.529
Anthony Taylor:  Is it impossible? No. Will there always be people trying on both sides to do it. Yes.

1154
02:14:40.850 --> 02:14:44.830
Anthony Taylor: there will always be people trying to fake it, and there will always be people trying to stop it.

1155
02:14:45.220 --> 02:14:59.679
Anthony Taylor: and the good news is that battle will go on just like the happy battles and everything else for all of us.  The bad news is, is no one's ever quit as soon as they figure out how to scan it, they're gonna figure out how to make it even better.

1156
02:15:00.660 --> 02:15:03.579
Anthony Taylor: So it's just gonna keep happening. But yeah.

1157
02:15:04.470 --> 02:15:10.010
Anthony Taylor: it is a future that we all have to look forward to. Okay, the good and the bad.

1158
02:15:10.510 --> 02:15:16.760
Anthony Taylor: because I guarantee you Nicholas Cage, instead of Tom Cruise, might be a good change. I don't know.

1159
02:15:17.130 --> 02:15:18.830
Anthony Taylor: All right, Rodney. What's up?

1160
02:15:19.610 --> 02:15:26.069
Rodney Simba Masarirambi: II think we can call that battle and job security cause you can always choose to be one or the other.

1161
02:15:27.150 --> 02:15:37.019
Anthony Taylor: That was the one thing I was gonna bring up earlier. But let's finish these questions. I like that. Try to help me remember that job security. But where do you expect day I to take you? What are you looking bricks? Do anybody got an answer for that?

1162
02:15:38.010 --> 02:15:40.010
Anthony Taylor: You want to do jobs. That's what you want.

1163
02:15:40.090 --> 02:15:43.810
Anthony Taylor: right? What are you looking to do? Make the world a better place

1164
02:15:45.350 --> 02:15:48.430
Anthony Taylor: for me in my pocketbook? Is that it. No.

1165
02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:50.410
Anthony Taylor: we're not selfish like that.

1166
02:15:52.320 --> 02:15:53.160
Anthony Taylor: maybe.

1167
02:15:53.680 --> 02:16:03.390
Anthony Taylor: All right. What about AI, this one? I do want you guys to answer, what about AI may be confusing? Who wants to answer that holy Moly? Have I already confused you?

1168
02:16:04.650 --> 02:16:08.380
Anthony Taylor: I have. That's good. because that means we got something to teach.

1169
02:16:09.430 --> 02:16:13.350
Anthony Taylor: If I have it. Well. don't fall asleep yet.

1170
02:16:15.750 --> 02:16:19.610
Anthony Taylor: Anybody have anything. Why, I might. What makes sense what doesn't

1171
02:16:22.490 --> 02:16:23.780
Anthony Taylor: going once?

1172
02:16:24.790 --> 02:16:30.120
Anthony Taylor: Alright, I won't. I won't bug you back, not yet. We'll come. Maybe we'll come back to that question another day.

1173
02:16:30.430 --> 02:16:40.910
Anthony Taylor: Alright, we already did break. So you can see how far behind I am. All right structure for the week. Consider conceptual understanding of AI, we've been doing that technical skills.

1174
02:16:41.020 --> 02:16:43.990
Anthony Taylor: First thing we're gonna learn. So now we're gonna do some hands-on.

1175
02:16:44.139 --> 02:16:50.029
Anthony Taylor: I know you're like. Finally, did I sign up for this? Listen, sky talk before we do that job security?

1176
02:16:50.530 --> 02:16:51.549
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1177
02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:58.759
Anthony Taylor: in the Industrial Revolution at the time anybody historians in here. I love historians. They just way smarter

1178
02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:06.620
Anthony Taylor: industrial revolution came along. What did everybody say? These machines are, gonna take everybody's jobs

1179
02:17:07.820 --> 02:17:10.889
Anthony Taylor: right? Did they? No

1180
02:17:11.840 --> 02:17:16.449
Anthony Taylor: Internet came along. What did they say? Machines are, gonna take everybody's jobs.

1181
02:17:17.020 --> 02:17:18.919
Anthony Taylor: Nope didn't do it.

1182
02:17:19.459 --> 02:17:24.659
Anthony Taylor: Okay, when computers I know that was before the Internet take care of my job. Nope didn't do it.

1183
02:17:25.110 --> 02:17:26.919
Anthony Taylor: The reality is

1184
02:17:27.549 --> 02:17:31.940
Anthony Taylor: is that when these big changes happen to us.

1185
02:17:32.059 --> 02:17:33.590
Anthony Taylor: it just opens new doors.

1186
02:17:33.740 --> 02:17:37.760
Anthony Taylor: and going back to what I believe, Jennifer said.

1187
02:17:37.870 --> 02:17:42.629
Anthony Taylor: right? The whole idea is, is now this level of stuff getting done.

1188
02:17:42.889 --> 02:17:44.970
Anthony Taylor: She's gonna get done by something else.

1189
02:17:46.440 --> 02:17:51.419
Anthony Taylor: Does that mean? Like the the I know who was my tech support Guy.

1190
02:17:51.850 --> 02:17:53.309
Anthony Taylor: was it? Was it you have to?

1191
02:17:54.420 --> 02:17:57.860
Anthony Taylor: Somebody's doing tech support? Not you, Hefty. You've been doing data engineer

1192
02:17:58.150 --> 02:18:07.150
Anthony Taylor: somebody, anyway. Rodney. Okay, right? Maybe Rodney won't be doing tech support on what he's doing it on now, but

1193
02:18:07.440 --> 02:18:16.060
Anthony Taylor: he might be doing tech support to help the ais or to make ais better. Okay, but the level that he's at right now may not be needed.

1194
02:18:16.100 --> 02:18:20.460
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. I don't know. But maybe Brian does a basic text. But you see my point.

1195
02:18:20.590 --> 02:18:24.790
Anthony Taylor: there will be a level of jobs that are going to basically move up

1196
02:18:26.280 --> 02:18:32.400
Anthony Taylor: just like when the industrial Revolution, just like when computers came to be just like when the Internet came to be

1197
02:18:33.299 --> 02:18:38.839
Anthony Taylor: all of those things. just new jobs for create robotics and factories.

1198
02:18:40.250 --> 02:18:41.870
Anthony Taylor: new jobs. We're creating.

1199
02:18:43.059 --> 02:18:44.000
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

1200
02:18:44.230 --> 02:18:49.969
Anthony Taylor: All right, all right, all right, all right, let's do some real work. This is exciting. Everyone. Have

1201
02:18:50.549 --> 02:18:56.689
Anthony Taylor: okay. So windows you, you should have something on your computer if you did your pre-work called

1202
02:18:56.790 --> 02:18:57.700
Anthony Taylor: Batch.

1203
02:18:57.879 --> 02:19:01.020
Anthony Taylor: So if you hit your start button type, get.

1204
02:19:01.410 --> 02:19:03.750
Anthony Taylor: you will see. Get bash.

1205
02:19:04.940 --> 02:19:09.330
Anthony Taylor: Okay, my Mac users, you will simply open a terminal.

1206
02:19:10.340 --> 02:19:11.920
Anthony Taylor: You guys not do that.

1207
02:19:11.940 --> 02:19:16.350
Anthony Taylor: You might not have to. I do not have a Mac to show you better have to. Just

1208
02:19:18.650 --> 02:19:24.129
Anthony Taylor: okay. Now, my windows users just for the record. You can also use

1209
02:19:24.430 --> 02:19:38.120
Anthony Taylor: terminal. It's not the same as the Mac terminal. but it's pretty cool. In fact, I'd highly recommend you learn to use it, because

1210
02:19:38.190 --> 02:19:44.849
Anthony Taylor: you can actually use get bash right here. and I'm going to use gifts right here because it's bigger, plump.

1211
02:19:45.879 --> 02:19:49.470
Anthony Taylor: Okay. alright.

1212
02:19:50.030 --> 02:19:53.069
Anthony Taylor: So why do we need a term?

1213
02:19:53.880 --> 02:20:00.839
Anthony Taylor: well, basically, our terminal is a way for us to interact with our computer.

1214
02:20:00.860 --> 02:20:06.770
Anthony Taylor: And you know, without a mouse do we need to do that? But

1215
02:20:06.960 --> 02:20:10.099
Anthony Taylor: there are some things that we can do that are helpful

1216
02:20:10.440 --> 02:20:11.590
Anthony Taylor: in the terminal.

1217
02:20:11.730 --> 02:20:14.360
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Any

1218
02:20:14.380 --> 02:20:27.010
Anthony Taylor: pretty much anything you can do with a mouse you can do in a terminal. Is it as easy. No, it's not alright. However, if you want to write a program that does a bunch of stuff for you on your computer.

1219
02:20:27.060 --> 02:20:33.039
Anthony Taylor: this is probably the best way to do it or use python, which you'll learn also. Okay, so first.

1220
02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:44.949
Anthony Taylor: let's start with some basic commands. All right. Pwd. Paul William Delphi. And that tells me where I am in my computer

1221
02:20:45.310 --> 02:20:53.320
Anthony Taylor: on windows. It's slash, c slash, user, slash empty. I'm in my users directory. Okay?

1222
02:20:53.950 --> 02:20:58.809
Anthony Taylor: Alright, this is helpful to know where I am. Okay.

1223
02:20:58.860 --> 02:21:00.629
Anthony Taylor: I can type Ls.

1224
02:21:01.540 --> 02:21:07.140
Anthony Taylor: and this will show me all the directories in my user directory.

1225
02:21:07.980 --> 02:21:16.960
Anthony Taylor: Okay, pretty cool. I'm going to go to my desktop. So how do I get to my desktop? I'm gonna use CD change

1226
02:21:17.150 --> 02:21:19.970
Anthony Taylor: directory, CD.

1227
02:21:20.290 --> 02:21:23.210
Anthony Taylor: Space desktop.

1228
02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:25.410
Anthony Taylor: Oh.

1229
02:21:26.320 --> 02:21:29.000
Anthony Taylor: CD, space, maybe slower case.

1230
02:21:30.900 --> 02:21:32.740
Anthony Taylor: Why is it doing that? Oh, that

1231
02:21:34.190 --> 02:21:37.860
Anthony Taylor: documents downloads for? Oh, I gotta go to users for that.

1232
02:21:38.490 --> 02:21:42.639
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Let's go to documents

1233
02:21:42.810 --> 02:21:46.960
Anthony Taylor: instead. That one's easier. So go to CD space

1234
02:21:46.970 --> 02:21:51.519
Anthony Taylor: documents. There we go. So now you can see

1235
02:21:52.430 --> 02:22:07.320
Anthony Taylor: where we are. We're documents. Okay. Now, before I move any further, let's go back. There's 2 ways to go back. In this case we're only one away from this. What's called the root. In this case

1236
02:22:07.330 --> 02:22:11.459
Anthony Taylor: we well, no, this is the route. This is the home directory in this case.

1237
02:22:11.690 --> 02:22:14.910
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this tilled. That's what that symbol is.

1238
02:22:15.270 --> 02:22:20.100
Anthony Taylor: So I can say, CD. Tilde.

1239
02:22:20.610 --> 02:22:28.159
Anthony Taylor: which is that little one next to your one key. Look at the keyboard, one key next to it. Shift, push that button.

1240
02:22:28.220 --> 02:22:32.430
Anthony Taylor: that's the tilt hit. Enter, and it takes you back to your home folder.

1241
02:22:32.880 --> 02:22:42.080
Anthony Taylor: I want to go back to documents. I can do that. I could type CD space documents again, or I can hit the up arrow 1, 2 time.

1242
02:22:43.130 --> 02:22:45.480
Anthony Taylor: Go back to previous commands. Hit! Enter

1243
02:22:47.170 --> 02:22:51.870
Anthony Taylor: now in here. I'm going to create a folder. Alright!

1244
02:22:51.890 --> 02:22:56.000
Anthony Taylor: How do I create a folder. Well, to create a folder, I'm going to type MK.

1245
02:22:56.460 --> 02:23:00.290
Anthony Taylor: DIR. So a folder on your computer is a directory.

1246
02:23:01.170 --> 02:23:05.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay, MK. Dir make directory.

1247
02:23:06.660 --> 02:23:12.119
Anthony Taylor: and for this one we're going to call it, and I want everybody to do well, you don't do it now, do it when you watch the video

1248
02:23:12.340 --> 02:23:14.480
Anthony Taylor: data class.

1249
02:23:16.810 --> 02:23:19.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And this is in my classroom norms. By the

1250
02:23:20.770 --> 02:23:26.300
Anthony Taylor: alright. So do that. Now, when you do. Ls, you're gonna see 80'clock

1251
02:23:28.010 --> 02:23:29.960
Anthony Taylor: CD space

1252
02:23:30.300 --> 02:23:31.420
Anthony Taylor: data class.

1253
02:23:33.010 --> 02:23:35.189
Anthony Taylor: Now, we're in data class.

1254
02:23:36.840 --> 02:23:37.600
Anthony Taylor: Aye.

1255
02:23:38.020 --> 02:23:43.119
Anthony Taylor: so what have we learned so far? We've learned how to list. What's in a directory

1256
02:23:43.580 --> 02:23:44.840
Anthony Taylor: with Ls.

1257
02:23:45.060 --> 02:23:54.200
Anthony Taylor: We learn how to move back and forth with CD. Oh, another CD. I wanted to go back to documents from here. I could do. CD space dot dot

1258
02:23:55.940 --> 02:24:05.280
Anthony Taylor: that takes us back one. I'm gonna go back into my daily class. CD, space data class. See? Now, I'm back in

1259
02:24:05.790 --> 02:24:08.930
Anthony Taylor: okay for those of you that love mouse.

1260
02:24:14.730 --> 02:24:16.160
Anthony Taylor: I have too much stuff in here.

1261
02:24:16.540 --> 02:24:19.410
Anthony Taylor: Class stuff.

1262
02:24:19.660 --> 02:24:33.620
Anthony Taylor: Oh, no! Ha! Okay. for those of you that love your mouse, and you're not using onedrive. You can go in and click, and you'll see that folder there. I'll get there in a second. I'll show you in a minute.

1263
02:24:33.650 --> 02:24:36.070
Anthony Taylor: In fact, you're gonna see it right now. So

1264
02:24:36.460 --> 02:24:40.119
Anthony Taylor: next, we're going to create a file in our directory

1265
02:24:42.150 --> 02:24:43.770
Anthony Taylor: type touch.

1266
02:24:45.090 --> 02:24:48.009
Anthony Taylor: And then the name of a file. Let's call it

1267
02:24:48.190 --> 02:24:50.980
my file dot txt

1268
02:24:51.970 --> 02:24:53.220
Anthony Taylor: hit. Enter.

1269
02:24:53.720 --> 02:24:58.190
Anthony Taylor: Now, how do I look in this directory to see what's in here? What's the command? We've already done it

1270
02:24:58.550 --> 02:24:59.810
Anthony Taylor: couple of times.

1271
02:25:02.230 --> 02:25:04.040
michael mcpherson: Ls, class.

1272
02:25:04.140 --> 02:25:08.490
Anthony Taylor: thank you. Ls, and there it is my file. Tet.

1273
02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:22.850
Anthony Taylor: so what touch does is it basically tells the computer. Hey? I want you to update basically the the modified date of this file. Now, it doesn't know. I mean, when there's no file there, it's just like. Oh, well, they must want me to make.

1274
02:25:23.380 --> 02:25:24.680
Anthony Taylor: Okay, yes, I

1275
02:25:26.310 --> 02:25:43.020
Sonja Baro (she/hers): and make a file, does that you? You put the extension txt. So if you change the extension to Pdf. Or to something else. It it would create a

1276
02:25:43.510 --> 02:25:47.710
Sonja Baro (she/hers): well. Would it create then? A Pdf. Would. But it doesn't have anything in it?

1277
02:25:48.390 --> 02:25:50.080
Anthony Taylor: Well, okay.

1278
02:25:50.280 --> 02:25:55.339
Sonja Baro (she/hers): no, that's a great answer. No, that's a great question. I love that question.

1279
02:25:55.560 --> 02:26:01.380
Anthony Taylor: So the short answer is, yes, it would create a Pdf file. No, you would not be able to read

1280
02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:06.729
Sonja Baro (she/hers): right? Cause. A Pdf file is basically a format

1281
02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:28.140
Sonja Baro (she/hers): of a file that is used for yeah, what about another extension. See? So that's where I'm like. Because is it? When we say we're going to make a file, is it's an actual OP. Object, or is, I don't know if that's the right term.

1282
02:26:28.330 --> 02:26:30.349
Anthony Taylor: Never hesitate to ask a question.

1283
02:26:30.730 --> 02:26:36.309
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So if we wanted to open it in Vs code, we could type code

1284
02:26:36.410 --> 02:26:38.689
Anthony Taylor: space. And then the name of that file.

1285
02:26:38.930 --> 02:26:48.370
Anthony Taylor: my file text. And what this will do is open and open. Now notice, it's just an empty file. And here.

1286
02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:54.440
Anthony Taylor: if we go oh. we could actually even open

1287
02:26:54.630 --> 02:26:58.139
Anthony Taylor: this folder users. Anthony documents.

1288
02:26:58.520 --> 02:27:02.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we can go open folder. This is like how to use.

1289
02:27:03.370 --> 02:27:04.940
Sonja Baro (she/hers): Yes, right?

1290
02:27:05.470 --> 02:27:11.419
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Vs code. So we'll click delay class, and then it'll show you here the whole direct.

1291
02:27:12.280 --> 02:27:19.759
Anthony Taylor: Okay, honestly, this is how we're gonna do it. But I still want you guys to learn the terminal a little bit. Okay.

1292
02:27:19.780 --> 02:27:24.040
Anthony Taylor: Another way. You can open this file is, you can if you're on

1293
02:27:24.500 --> 02:27:28.910
Anthony Taylor: oh, you know what? That's why they took that out. That's so funny.

1294
02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:33.089
Anthony Taylor: Okay, well, you can do on a Mac open

1295
02:27:33.310 --> 02:27:37.679
Sonja Baro (she/hers): space period, and it'll open this folder

1296
02:27:38.040 --> 02:27:44.619
Anthony Taylor: on a windows box. You can do explorer space period, and it will open that phone.

1297
02:27:45.790 --> 02:27:46.860
Anthony Taylor: See? There?

1298
02:27:47.790 --> 02:27:51.789
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so that's how you can get there quickly if you want to see it.

1299
02:27:52.260 --> 02:27:59.720
Anthony Taylor:  So in our file, while we're Vs code, we could type stuff in here

1300
02:27:59.940 --> 02:28:03.160
Anthony Taylor: and then save it by hitting control. S,

1301
02:28:03.410 --> 02:28:05.869
Anthony Taylor: see if I type more stuff.

1302
02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:10.540
Anthony Taylor: Notice this little dot up here that tells me that it is not safe.

1303
02:28:11.590 --> 02:28:16.700
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so that means there's something has changed so I can hit control. S. And it's been saved.

1304
02:28:16.850 --> 02:28:27.840
Anthony Taylor: Also, if I added some more stuff in here. Notice over here. there's a little one Ds code. That tells me that something's been changed and I need to save it.

1305
02:28:27.900 --> 02:28:40.690
Anthony Taylor: So I can hit control. S, as in Sam and say. okay. so we could close this. We can. Ls, again. We can see it's still there. But then it's changed.

1306
02:28:41.110 --> 02:28:43.839
Anthony Taylor: Alright. But it has.

1307
02:28:44.420 --> 02:28:53.779
Anthony Taylor:  Let's say, let's just get rid of it. Hate that, actually, no, let's read it in the terminal something I never expected to do.

1308
02:28:55.180 --> 02:28:57.369
Anthony Taylor: There are times when I do it.

1309
02:28:57.410 --> 02:28:59.619
Anthony Taylor: but it's pretty rare

1310
02:28:59.740 --> 02:29:01.370
Anthony Taylor: if you do, cat.

1311
02:29:01.630 --> 02:29:03.740
Anthony Taylor: and then the name

1312
02:29:04.750 --> 02:29:06.670
Anthony Taylor: you can see what's inside your file.

1313
02:29:08.390 --> 02:29:11.799
Anthony Taylor: This was a giant file that would be a huge monster mess.

1314
02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:14.210
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

1315
02:29:14.780 --> 02:29:17.899
Anthony Taylor: If you want to remove it.

1316
02:29:19.110 --> 02:29:27.790
Anthony Taylor: Okay, in fact, before we remove it, let's well, no, let's remove it, so we'll do. Rm, and then just my file, Dot.

1317
02:29:28.800 --> 02:29:30.020
Anthony Taylor: and now it's gone.

1318
02:29:31.450 --> 02:29:34.189
Anthony Taylor: Let's make a new directory. How do I make a new directory?

1319
02:29:36.410 --> 02:29:41.280
Meredith McCanse (she/her): MKDR. Thank you very much. MK. Dir.

1320
02:29:41.560 --> 02:29:43.990
Anthony Taylor: right? And then we just give it a name, a name.

1321
02:29:44.680 --> 02:29:48.679
Anthony Taylor: Now we have a directory. How do I know? That's a directory. It's blue

1322
02:29:48.930 --> 02:29:50.480
Anthony Taylor: and it has a slash. F,

1323
02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:54.169
Anthony Taylor: it's not always blue. Just so, you know, it is online.

1324
02:29:54.970 --> 02:29:57.099
Anthony Taylor: We'll go into that direction.

1325
02:29:57.720 --> 02:30:03.350
Anthony Taylor: I'm excited. I'm in here. Do I have anything? No, I'm gonna leave. How do I go back? One directory?

1326
02:30:06.300 --> 02:30:07.670
Derek Rikke: TV's got it?

1327
02:30:07.910 --> 02:30:13.569
Anthony Taylor: Cdspace dot dot enter. Now I'm back. Let's get rid of that. A name.

1328
02:30:13.620 --> 02:30:19.360
Anthony Taylor: So to get rid of a directory would type RM. Dash R,

1329
02:30:21.400 --> 02:30:24.640
Anthony Taylor: and then the name of the director. Amen

1330
02:30:24.830 --> 02:30:27.410
Anthony Taylor: enter Ls, dot.

1331
02:30:31.970 --> 02:30:33.389
Anthony Taylor: that was a lot right?

1332
02:30:34.440 --> 02:30:38.569
Anthony Taylor: The good news is, guys, we don't do a lot of this. So go ahead.

1333
02:30:39.280 --> 02:30:47.449
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So when you removed just a file. You didn't. You just had, did. Rm, and then the name of the file. But to remove it directly you put minus r in front of it.

1334
02:30:47.580 --> 02:30:49.170
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Correct.

1335
02:30:49.280 --> 02:30:52.009
Anthony Taylor: right? And let's see it

1336
02:30:53.250 --> 02:30:58.490
Anthony Taylor: right? So. Oh, Nope, that didn't do it! Oh, what is it? Are

1337
02:30:59.630 --> 02:31:00.450
Anthony Taylor: help!

1338
02:31:04.940 --> 02:31:15.029
Anthony Taylor: So most commands in command line. Have a help. and usually you can get them by typing command, and either dash, help, or dash, dash, help!

1339
02:31:15.500 --> 02:31:19.249
Anthony Taylor: And then this shows you what all those

1340
02:31:19.320 --> 02:31:26.200
Anthony Taylor: options are so dash. R is recursive, removes, directories and their contents.

1341
02:31:27.280 --> 02:31:32.990
Anthony Taylor: If you did just D, it would remove it empty, which means, if there was something in it, and you tried to do it.

1342
02:31:33.290 --> 02:31:34.340
Anthony Taylor: it would fail.

1343
02:31:35.810 --> 02:31:44.950
Anthony Taylor: And it would tell you, there's something in there. Okay. And and guys. please don't worry about what you're seeing on this. This is

1344
02:31:45.390 --> 02:31:51.679
Anthony Taylor: this kind of thing that I show you, so that you haven't in the back of your mind not going to do this very often.

1345
02:31:52.030 --> 02:31:55.549
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But you do need to know the terminal, at least the basis.

1346
02:31:56.380 --> 02:32:01.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. So we do have an activity with the terminal for you to do. But

1347
02:32:01.880 --> 02:32:04.490
Anthony Taylor: we only have like 13 min. So let me see

1348
02:32:06.230 --> 02:32:16.640
Anthony Taylor: what else we're gonna do. Actually. let's just do it together. But what does that mean? That means? I'm like, I'm going to stay right here.

1349
02:32:17.930 --> 02:32:23.920
Anthony Taylor: And we're going to open up the activity. So we're not gonna do any breakouts today. How much of a bummer is that?

1350
02:32:24.370 --> 02:32:30.960
Anthony Taylor:  And I'm gonna bring up your chair

1351
02:32:35.170 --> 02:32:36.220
Anthony Taylor: there

1352
02:32:36.580 --> 02:32:43.960
Anthony Taylor: and there. Okay. so if I wanted to clear the screen over here. Get rid of all that mess I could just type clear. It's clear.

1353
02:32:45.420 --> 02:32:49.490
Anthony Taylor: Okay. here's the instructions to our activity.

1354
02:32:49.500 --> 02:32:54.579
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna pretend like we're all in this, is it? We're gonna do. I'm gonna mix into a learning moment.

1355
02:32:54.590 --> 02:33:09.369
Anthony Taylor: We're all gonna be in the breakout room we just got here or like, hey, how's it going? Alright. Alright! Who's gonna share the screen? Anthony's gonna share? Oh, cool, great. I always did

1356
02:33:09.960 --> 02:33:10.750
Anthony Taylor: whatever.

1357
02:33:11.320 --> 02:33:14.849
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. So you guys are my group.

1358
02:33:15.570 --> 02:33:19.740
Anthony Taylor: Alright, you know what guys? I wasn't listening to Anthony. It's boring.

1359
02:33:19.750 --> 02:33:24.180
Anthony Taylor: And I really was reading an article about openwatch.

1360
02:33:24.480 --> 02:33:27.640
Anthony Taylor: So what do? How do I check? What directory I'm in?

1361
02:33:30.390 --> 02:33:33.839
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Pwd. Pwd.

1362
02:33:34.100 --> 02:33:35.100
oh.

1363
02:33:35.320 --> 02:33:43.030
Anthony Taylor: I wonder what that means? Do you think? What do you think Pwd means? He's an idiot. Maybe it means

1364
02:33:43.260 --> 02:33:54.250
Anthony Taylor: like working directory, probably personal work item, present working item. Anyway, okay, navigate to desktop. We're not gonna do that. We're just gonna go to dated class, which.

1365
02:33:54.490 --> 02:33:56.520
Anthony Taylor: So I'm gonna change it somewhere else.

1366
02:33:56.700 --> 02:33:59.089
Anthony Taylor: Okay, get me to data class

1367
02:34:00.970 --> 02:34:02.080
Sonja Baro (she/hers): CD,

1368
02:34:02.780 --> 02:34:08.289
Sonja Baro (she/hers): and then the space and then the directory you want

1369
02:34:08.960 --> 02:34:13.769
Sonja Baro (she/hers): data class is 2 directories away. You think I could do it all in one line?

1370
02:34:15.510 --> 02:34:16.360
Sonja Baro (she/hers): Yeah.

1371
02:34:16.720 --> 02:34:19.949
Anthony Taylor: why not? Right? Let's try it. Documents.

1372
02:34:21.120 --> 02:34:22.310
Sonja Baro (she/hers): space

1373
02:34:22.340 --> 02:34:23.820
Anthony Taylor: data class.

1374
02:34:24.360 --> 02:34:26.750
Anthony Taylor:  no.

1375
02:34:27.070 --> 02:34:29.220
Anthony Taylor: What do you guys think went wrong? Let's try.

1376
02:34:29.530 --> 02:34:31.780
Sonja Baro (she/hers): How about that? Oh, that works?

1377
02:34:31.980 --> 02:34:34.180
Sonja Baro (she/hers): Yeah, that first slash. Oh.

1378
02:34:35.570 --> 02:34:43.320
Anthony Taylor: glad to figure that out alright. So let's make sure we're where we're supposed to be. Yep, we're into aid class. Okay, cool.

1379
02:34:43.690 --> 02:34:51.409
Anthony Taylor: alright. And it says, Create a folder called pets. How do I create a folder somebody somebody

1380
02:34:52.010 --> 02:34:55.280
Anthony Taylor: who wants to answer them. Hurry

1381
02:34:56.810 --> 02:35:01.350
Curry Gardner: M. Kd-dir, and then space! That's

1382
02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:03.230
Anthony Taylor: that's

1383
02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:07.640
Anthony Taylor: I like it. And then we're gonna go into it. How do I get in there?

1384
02:35:12.580 --> 02:35:16.630
Rodney Simba Masarirambi: There we go. There we go see

1385
02:35:16.810 --> 02:35:18.000
Anthony Taylor: pets.

1386
02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:23.359
Anthony Taylor: There you go, and then it says, make 2 more folders, so make directory

1387
02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:25.250
Anthony Taylor: dogs.

1388
02:35:26.170 --> 02:35:35.940
Anthony Taylor: and do I need to move? I don't right, cause I'm still in pets, so I can do make directory cats. Now. I have dogs and cats in the same pets. Folder.

1389
02:35:37.320 --> 02:35:39.779
Anthony Taylor: Alright, it'll be pandemonium.

1390
02:35:39.870 --> 02:35:42.659
Derek Rikke: So now we're gonna go online with a slash.

1391
02:35:43.590 --> 02:35:44.990
Anthony Taylor: Oh.

1392
02:35:46.930 --> 02:35:50.130
Anthony Taylor: the the short answer's sorry. What was that?

1393
02:35:53.790 --> 02:35:54.650
Anthony Taylor: What, Michael.

1394
02:35:57.750 --> 02:35:59.590
michael mcpherson: you're unmuted. I can hear you.

1395
02:35:59.650 --> 02:36:01.640
Anthony Taylor: I thought I thought I heard Mike say that.

1396
02:36:02.160 --> 02:36:11.090
michael mcpherson: Oh, no, I was reading and typing, so what was your question? II have to ask this question. Oh, no, I didn't. I didn't. II thought I heard you talk.

1397
02:36:11.330 --> 02:36:16.960
Anthony Taylor:  am I the only one who Mike speak is delayed.

1398
02:36:18.800 --> 02:36:20.539
michael mcpherson: Okay, I'm the only one

1399
02:36:21.770 --> 02:36:29.849
Anthony Taylor: I just wanted to make sure it's not me. Alright. Alright. You're okay. We can hear you fine. It's just like. It's like I see you talk. And then the words go.

1400
02:36:30.520 --> 02:36:32.149
michael mcpherson: Did you unmute me.

1401
02:36:32.160 --> 02:36:35.160
michael mcpherson: or did I do that? I didn't, sir? I don't know how to unmute.

1402
02:36:35.410 --> 02:36:37.340
Anthony Taylor: I can only ask you to.

1403
02:36:38.200 --> 02:36:40.580
Anthony Taylor: It doesn't give me the ability to unmute you.

1404
02:36:41.120 --> 02:36:43.560
michael mcpherson: I don't know. I can mute you without you knowing.

1405
02:36:44.590 --> 02:36:47.540
michael mcpherson: Oh, okay, well, that's nice. I would never do that.

1406
02:36:47.840 --> 02:36:49.519
michael mcpherson: I care too much.

1407
02:36:50.330 --> 02:36:55.259
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So let's go into our cats. Folder. Cdc. Oh, that answer your question.

1408
02:36:56.570 --> 02:37:01.250
Anthony Taylor: It is possible to do multiple commands in a single line. We're not going to learn that.

1409
02:37:01.810 --> 02:37:05.529
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But no, you couldn't have done the slash, and you would add 2 folks

1410
02:37:05.840 --> 02:37:11.030
Anthony Taylor: in the same, you know, pets, dogs, and inside dogs with cats that

1411
02:37:11.470 --> 02:37:18.350
Anthony Taylor: would have been unnatural. So we're just going to go to cats. Okay. So in cats, we're gonna create a file.

1412
02:37:18.880 --> 02:37:20.339
Anthony Taylor: We're going to use touch.

1413
02:37:20.420 --> 02:37:23.210
Anthony Taylor: See, I didn't ask you guys, what should I?

1414
02:37:23.330 --> 02:37:25.989
Anthony Taylor: I'll see. Name dot text.

1415
02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:29.489
Anthony Taylor: okay, how do I open that file?

1416
02:37:34.490 --> 02:37:36.199
Sonja Baro (she/hers): That's how it comes

1417
02:37:36.790 --> 02:37:38.889
Anthony Taylor: open. Well, if you're on a map.

1418
02:37:39.300 --> 02:37:48.069
Sonja Baro (she/hers): So I'm using my own cheat sheet for Mac. That's good.

1419
02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:52.059
Natalie Mason: Oh, you could do code. I like code.

1420
02:37:52.090 --> 02:37:55.389
Anthony Taylor: Code takes us to the app we're gonna use all the time.

1421
02:37:56.890 --> 02:37:57.979
Anthony Taylor: And there we go.

1422
02:37:58.020 --> 02:38:01.940
Anthony Taylor: And inside of here, it says, do what? I can't see the instructions anymore.

1423
02:38:04.660 --> 02:38:05.790
Anthony Taylor: Where did they go?

1424
02:38:09.050 --> 02:38:17.760
Anthony Taylor: Oh, my name is Lucky Bark. Why, the heck are we putting? My name is Lucky bark in the cats folder. Stupid!

1425
02:38:20.530 --> 02:38:21.560
Anthony Taylor: It's lucky

1426
02:38:26.300 --> 02:38:35.539
Anthony Taylor: created by Chat G. Ppt.

1427
02:38:35.930 --> 02:38:38.759
Sonja Baro (she/hers): Yeah, that's no way to devil.

1428
02:38:38.810 --> 02:38:40.879
Anthony Taylor: They would never run a pursuit

1429
02:38:43.100 --> 02:38:51.299
Anthony Taylor: anyway. So my name is Lucky bark alright, and we can see it's not saved. How do I save it without touching my mouse

1430
02:38:54.390 --> 02:38:55.360
Derek Rikke: control? S.

1431
02:38:55.960 --> 02:38:58.460
Anthony Taylor: Thank you, Derek, control. S.

1432
02:38:59.140 --> 02:39:00.170
Anthony Taylor: Alright!

1433
02:39:00.430 --> 02:39:07.479
Anthony Taylor: Alright! Now, to close this. This is a little more complicated. There's a couple of ways we could get back to the prompt from here.

1434
02:39:07.710 --> 02:39:17.790
Anthony Taylor: One we could get alt F. 4. Anyone ever tells you to do that while you're in a game or something. They're like dude vote for me hit alt F. 4. They're messing with you.

1435
02:39:18.210 --> 02:39:19.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay, don't do it

1436
02:39:20.350 --> 02:39:23.990
Anthony Taylor: alright, or you can just hit Alt Tab.

1437
02:39:24.050 --> 02:39:29.400
Anthony Taylor: And what you'll see is all these different windows. These are all the windows I have. Okay.

1438
02:39:29.420 --> 02:39:34.540
Anthony Taylor: And I'm just gonna go right here because that's where I want to be. And now I'm back where I was.

1439
02:39:35.680 --> 02:39:36.550
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1440
02:39:38.020 --> 02:39:40.939
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So we did. That saved it.

1441
02:39:40.960 --> 02:39:46.989
Anthony Taylor: Now we can read it. How would I read it with inside of here? What's the command?

1442
02:39:52.930 --> 02:39:53.670
Derek Rikke: Cat.

1443
02:39:53.820 --> 02:40:02.280
Anthony Taylor: Yes, cat, yeah. Claim and cat claim. And Derek, they're they're gonna be experts at this here console stuff

1444
02:40:02.290 --> 02:40:04.910
Clayton Graves: can always use and also use less.

1445
02:40:05.690 --> 02:40:12.410
Anthony Taylor: Les, I'm gonna try it less name dot tense. Oh, yeah. Cause that gives you like a page at a time.

1446
02:40:12.720 --> 02:40:14.910
Anthony Taylor: Oh, great! Now, how am I gonna get out of

1447
02:40:16.100 --> 02:40:16.920
Anthony Taylor: it's

1448
02:40:17.560 --> 02:40:18.949
Clayton Graves: hit the escape button.

1449
02:40:19.570 --> 02:40:31.050
Anthony Taylor: I did. It won't let me out. How about control? C. Oh, that helps control. C again. Control X, because Z, hey? We got it

1450
02:40:31.190 --> 02:40:32.670
Anthony Taylor: will ever help you get

1451
02:40:33.600 --> 02:40:41.620
Anthony Taylor: okay. Teasing man, thank you. Yeah. There's other ones, too. There's like more. And there's but the one we're gonna worry about is tap.

1452
02:40:42.120 --> 02:40:44.630
Anthony Taylor: okay?

1453
02:40:45.680 --> 02:40:50.440
Anthony Taylor: So we did that. So let's go now. It says, go back to pets. How do I get back to pets.

1454
02:40:50.570 --> 02:41:02.759
Meredith McCanse (she/her): We? How did you get out of the the less? Oh, control z control. Z, okay, got it as in Z,

1455
02:41:03.130 --> 02:41:06.850
Clayton Graves: and back to pets you go. CD dot dot.

1456
02:41:07.410 --> 02:41:15.370
Anthony Taylor: Thank you. CD dot dot dot darn it, how about Cdc, Cdspace, dot dot sorry?

1457
02:41:15.500 --> 02:41:20.350
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we're back at pets

1458
02:41:20.500 --> 02:41:27.709
Sonja Baro (she/hers): so why couldn't you could. You have done CD, and then the name

1459
02:41:27.920 --> 02:41:29.829
Sonja Baro (she/hers): all the way across. Yes.

1460
02:41:30.270 --> 02:41:32.720
Anthony Taylor: that is a lot of typing. Yeah.

1461
02:41:32.990 --> 02:41:35.720
Sonja Baro (she/hers): Okay, so the next, okay.

1462
02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:37.440
Anthony Taylor: absolutely.

1463
02:41:37.690 --> 02:41:51.579
Anthony Taylor:  CDCD dot dots kinda like a shortcut when when you start getting into really long paths, and you're copying things and things like that, it's just an easier way to backup.

1464
02:41:53.950 --> 02:41:57.770
Anthony Taylor: So one more thing you could do. And I'm going to do this without

1465
02:41:58.970 --> 02:42:04.280
Anthony Taylor: Walker. Just so, you guys know, you could type echo. and then you can put

1466
02:42:04.470 --> 02:42:07.570
Anthony Taylor: I am not a dog.

1467
02:42:08.590 --> 02:42:11.270
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then pipe.

1468
02:42:11.630 --> 02:42:20.679
Anthony Taylor: which is basically just a greater than sign, and then pipe that into a file. So name 2 dot text

1469
02:42:21.050 --> 02:42:24.400
Anthony Taylor: enter. And now when you list, you'll see there's 2 file settings.

1470
02:42:25.090 --> 02:42:29.440
Anthony Taylor: So basically, it took that text and put it in that file for you.

1471
02:42:30.130 --> 02:42:33.000
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Don't worry too much about that. It's cool.

1472
02:42:33.950 --> 02:42:36.709
Anthony Taylor: but it's not anything to get to

1473
02:42:37.360 --> 02:42:41.119
Anthony Taylor: excited about. So now that we have those.

1474
02:42:41.740 --> 02:42:44.780
Anthony Taylor: Let's

1475
02:42:45.470 --> 02:42:54.139
Anthony Taylor: what does it want us to do now? It says. move back to the root, copy the name text, file into the dog's folder.

1476
02:42:55.900 --> 02:43:00.280
Anthony Taylor: I don't think that's gonna work. Let's do change directory.

1477
02:43:00.570 --> 02:43:01.880
Anthony Taylor: Move.

1478
02:43:04.960 --> 02:43:08.250
Clayton Graves: Well, are you moving? Or are you copying?

1479
02:43:08.740 --> 02:43:12.380
Anthony Taylor: Well, we could do copy, but we're gonna use move for this.

1480
02:43:12.400 --> 02:43:14.450
Clayton Graves: Okay? So

1481
02:43:14.500 --> 02:43:15.690
Anthony Taylor: Lou.

1482
02:43:16.160 --> 02:43:20.629
Anthony Taylor: so we need to type out like the whole path to do that. So we can do

1483
02:43:20.920 --> 02:43:26.710
Anthony Taylor: cats. Slash name text to name.

1484
02:43:27.050 --> 02:43:29.050
Anthony Taylor: Sorry. Now we'll just move it

1485
02:43:30.050 --> 02:43:32.610
Anthony Taylor: to here. Yeah.

1486
02:43:33.640 --> 02:43:44.650
Anthony Taylor: Permission denied. I had a feeling that was gonna happen. That's why I was like. Look at that going! I don't wanna do that things. Let's do dogs.

1487
02:43:45.170 --> 02:43:46.560
Anthony Taylor: The dogs are dogs.

1488
02:43:48.220 --> 02:43:52.699
Anthony Taylor: darn it! I don't remember dogs or dogs

1489
02:43:54.040 --> 02:43:55.930
Anthony Taylor: dogs with an ass. Sh!

1490
02:43:56.280 --> 02:43:56.950
Okay.

1491
02:43:57.880 --> 02:44:07.340
Anthony Taylor: it's still not gonna let me do it. Start it. That's because I didn't put it on the desktop. So  hmm!

1492
02:44:08.820 --> 02:44:12.189
Anthony Taylor: Trying to think of a way to get us to this without a problem

1493
02:44:13.220 --> 02:44:15.920
Anthony Taylor: trying to get past my own security. I love that.

1494
02:44:15.960 --> 02:44:20.640
Anthony Taylor: But anyway, basically, this is the command you want to do? Is this working for any of you?

1495
02:44:23.110 --> 02:44:28.219
Anthony Taylor: Is it? Yeah, okay? So don't worry about the fact that my permission is tonight ignore that.

1496
02:44:28.230 --> 02:44:33.590
Clayton Graves: That's just cause of where I put it. I in order to get around that I opened

1497
02:44:33.850 --> 02:44:36.359
Clayton Graves: on windows. I open it as admin.

1498
02:44:36.610 --> 02:44:40.949
Anthony Taylor: yeah. yeah, that is definitely a worker, absolutely.

1499
02:44:41.070 --> 02:44:45.710
Anthony Taylor: And it's all good. Don't worry about it. Not a big deal. It worked for you guys. That's what's important.

1500
02:44:46.050 --> 02:44:47.980
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So

1501
02:44:48.290 --> 02:44:52.780
Anthony Taylor: now we're gonna get rid of it. Let's get rid of everything. So we're gonna do. Rm.

1502
02:44:53.290 --> 02:44:56.219
Anthony Taylor: dash, r, we'll get rid of those cats.

1503
02:44:57.040 --> 02:45:00.289
Anthony Taylor: Okay. RM. Dash R. Dogs.

1504
02:45:00.760 --> 02:45:03.120
Anthony Taylor: and then RM.

1505
02:45:03.180 --> 02:45:06.089
Anthony Taylor: Dash R. Pets.

1506
02:45:06.320 --> 02:45:07.460
Anthony Taylor: Whoa!

1507
02:45:08.620 --> 02:45:10.130
Anthony Taylor: I can't do pets. Why.

1508
02:45:12.180 --> 02:45:13.520
Clayton Graves: you're in pets.

1509
02:45:14.150 --> 02:45:16.630
Anthony Taylor: Clayton. He's right

1510
02:45:17.790 --> 02:45:20.760
Anthony Taylor: alright now that we're not in there are in.

1511
02:45:20.800 --> 02:45:22.060
Sonja Baro (she/hers): That's our

1512
02:45:22.630 --> 02:45:28.460
Anthony Taylor: pets. There we go. Can't get rid of them if they're already there. Okay.

1513
02:45:28.470 --> 02:45:37.240
Clayton Graves: yeah. Dash, R. Would that have removed everything. If you were to back out, would it have removed everything in one command?

1514
02:45:37.760 --> 02:45:39.809
Anthony Taylor: It did cause. See, we did cats

1515
02:45:41.030 --> 02:45:44.740
Anthony Taylor: right. We didn't delete the files.

1516
02:45:44.960 --> 02:45:50.780
Dipinto, Matt: If you had done our pets killed cats and dogs before you, it would have also done

1517
02:45:50.810 --> 02:45:54.779
Anthony Taylor: absolutely. No, you're right. It would

1518
02:45:55.570 --> 02:46:00.110
Sonja Baro (she/hers): so we could have done it at that level, too. And that's when you go. No.

1519
02:46:00.150 --> 02:46:04.329
Sonja Baro (she/hers): usually that is true. Cause this isn't putting it in the trash can

1520
02:46:04.590 --> 02:46:07.720
Anthony Taylor: right for this. You gotta use golf.

1521
02:46:08.960 --> 02:46:13.439
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So actually, I'm pretty sure it's gone at that point. Let's make sure

1522
02:46:14.360 --> 02:46:19.800
Anthony Taylor: trash can. Nope, my trash cans empty. Didn't put it in there. It's just gone

1523
02:46:20.900 --> 02:46:28.360
Anthony Taylor: in the warm heart. That's exactly right. Okay,

1524
02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:30.660
Anthony Taylor: And I think

1525
02:46:32.360 --> 02:46:34.660
Anthony Taylor: that is it.

1526
02:46:36.140 --> 02:46:41.279
Anthony Taylor: phone. It's 1032 alright. Bear with me for 1 s I will tell you guys.

1527
02:46:42.560 --> 02:46:44.519
Anthony Taylor: I tried very hard

1528
02:46:44.670 --> 02:46:46.320
Anthony Taylor: to not ever go late.

1529
02:46:46.610 --> 02:46:56.259
Anthony Taylor:  we just are a little late today. This is the way it is. But we've had a really fun class today. I just want to show you.

1530
02:47:04.210 --> 02:47:07.219
Anthony Taylor: does everybody understand where to see your homework?

1531
02:47:09.280 --> 02:47:10.250
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, no.

1532
02:47:10.800 --> 02:47:14.310
Anthony Taylor: alright. You don't need to worry about it today. Okay.

1533
02:47:14.690 --> 02:47:22.630
Anthony Taylor: but you would go to the module. You should see introduction to AI. Here's today's stuff. Alright.

1534
02:47:22.800 --> 02:47:26.360
Anthony Taylor: Don't worry about this. Is this stuff where we're moving?

1535
02:47:26.750 --> 02:47:28.270
Anthony Taylor: And then

1536
02:47:28.660 --> 02:47:32.389
Anthony Taylor: at the end, oh, look at you! Oh, no, there it is.

1537
02:47:33.200 --> 02:47:35.230
Anthony Taylor: I said, like there isn't one. But there's

1538
02:47:35.330 --> 02:47:39.049
Anthony Taylor: okay. So this one is probably just going to be.

1539
02:47:41.180 --> 02:47:43.230
Anthony Taylor: This one is just like

1540
02:47:43.620 --> 02:47:44.780
Anthony Taylor: a writing one.

1541
02:47:45.150 --> 02:47:59.870
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you're gonna write a little case study. You're gonna talk about what? How you think you could use things. You're gonna create a repository. We'll get to that. Don't worry and you're gonna submit it in there. So this is your first homework.

1542
02:48:00.300 --> 02:48:11.270
Anthony Taylor: I think you could probably begin this one if you really wanted to, since you have Tuesday off. right? Most of my all my cohorts from the last plus years has been Monday, Tuesday, Thursday.

1543
02:48:11.800 --> 02:48:16.280
Anthony Taylor: So it's the first time I read Tuesdays off. I'm going to eat Tacos. That's what I'm going to do.

1544
02:48:16.340 --> 02:48:21.109
Anthony Taylor: But yes, so that's it. That's it. So this is it.

1545
02:48:22.300 --> 02:48:30.120
Anthony Taylor: This is where you find it. This is basically right, the the breakdown, how they're going to score it

1546
02:48:30.920 --> 02:48:37.390
Anthony Taylor: last thing, and then we'll let you go. Central grading does all of your grading. If you don't like what they have to say.

1547
02:48:40.660 --> 02:48:41.680
Anthony Taylor: tell me that.

1548
02:48:42.510 --> 02:48:49.120
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I can override any grade I want to. If I feel your argument is correct.

1549
02:48:50.400 --> 02:48:51.330
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1550
02:48:51.550 --> 02:48:56.839
Anthony Taylor: and I will. And I've done it pretty much, every go, or I least I always have at least one or 2,

1551
02:48:56.870 --> 02:49:00.790
Anthony Taylor: and a lot of. It's like, well, that was plagiarism. And I'm like.

1552
02:49:01.070 --> 02:49:03.660
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you're you're you're you're you're

1553
02:49:04.020 --> 02:49:06.290
Anthony Taylor: a central grader. What do I care what you have to say?

1554
02:49:06.400 --> 02:49:08.780
Anthony Taylor: Okay, my class love it.

1555
02:49:09.710 --> 02:49:15.910
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Okay. That's it, guys. So I will.

1556
02:49:16.010 --> 02:49:27.219
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yes, sorry, Anthony. Oh. like creating the repository and stuff like that. Should we figure out how to do that on our own, and like, be ready to do it next time

1557
02:49:27.230 --> 02:49:34.550
Anthony Taylor: you really. So what I will do not this week. So much

1558
02:49:34.610 --> 02:49:41.150
Anthony Taylor: is in your resources. Did you see? Do you guys see that channel resources right here?

1559
02:49:41.260 --> 02:49:55.180
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I will post. Probably not. This week is, I don't have any like cool resources for this week yet. but starting next week, when we start python, I will post like stuff that you guys can do

1560
02:49:55.710 --> 02:50:00.570
Anthony Taylor: ahead of time, and I 100% guarantee you.

1561
02:50:00.650 --> 02:50:02.349
Anthony Taylor: If you do it.

1562
02:50:02.410 --> 02:50:05.590
Anthony Taylor: class will be way easier for you

1563
02:50:06.120 --> 02:50:09.599
Anthony Taylor: most of the time. Students don't do it.

1564
02:50:10.170 --> 02:50:15.129
Anthony Taylor: But the ones that do always tend to tell me later, you're like, Oh, my God.

1565
02:50:15.290 --> 02:50:23.479
Anthony Taylor: that made class so easy, right? Because basically it's just like, Hey, this is what we're gonna do in class. Here's some really quick. I try to keep them short

1566
02:50:23.600 --> 02:50:27.549
Anthony Taylor: articles practice stuff like that that. You can go, do on your own.

1567
02:50:27.600 --> 02:50:33.979
Anthony Taylor: Come to class. It's like, Oh, my God, that's what I was just doing in these resources. Okay. so that's it, Gabe.

1568
02:50:34.090 --> 02:50:41.430
Anthony Taylor: so we will be here for 30 more minutes. But we do stop the recording. At this time class is officially over. You are free to leave.
