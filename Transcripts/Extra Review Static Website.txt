00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:14.399
Anthony Taylor: Start recording. Hi, everybody! Welcome to the extra review how to host a static website on us. Your.

2
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:25.779
Anthony Taylor: But first we need to make sure we have your account, and Sonya arrived, and she is setting hers up. So we thought we would show what that looks like.

3
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.340
Anthony Taylor: So she has gone to Portal. Dotom looks like looks like you're already set up.

4
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:41.979
Anthony Taylor: You think so. I just literally you're there. This is all you need. Well, you can do. Start as you're with free trial, the first one. There, hold on! Get my arrow this out.

5
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.410
Anthony Taylor: I found it

6
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.110
Baro, Sonja: right. And then just do

7
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:53.209
Anthony Taylor: yeah, start free. So all those services at the bottom there get those free forever, many of them.

8
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.559
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So click the start, the start free button.

9
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.110
Anthony Taylor: and it might have you sign up and do some stuff it might not. Let's see where it takes you.

10
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.600
Anthony Taylor: hoping it just takes you to the port. Okay, no, it's gonna give you a sign up screen.

11
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:19.030
Anthony Taylor: I signed up for this a very long time ago. I'm sure the screen has changed many, many times since I signed. Let's take a quick peek.

12
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:27.860
Meredith McCanse (she/her): It wasn't II just did it a few minutes ago. It's not terrible, but it was. It wouldn't let me get past the screen until I did the step of

13
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.919
Meredith McCanse (she/her):  texting me to confirm my phone number

14
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.060
Anthony Taylor: cool, which wasn't super clear that I had to do that first. So yeah, make sure you select your state.

15
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.650
Anthony Taylor: Confusion didn't work.

16
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.880
michael mcpherson: hey? Remember not to block out your credit card number as you type it in.

17
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.099
Anthony Taylor: I don't know if you need to. Here's your make sure you

18
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.950
Anthony Taylor: verify your code at the top. There. go up

19
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.739
Anthony Taylor: up on the screen. Oh, yeah.

20
00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.520
Baro, Sonja: I gotta get it.

21
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.859
Anthony Taylor: Gotta get it.

22
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.790
Anthony Taylor: God get it!

23
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.450
Anthony Taylor: See, this is perfectly fine for the demo, this demo, if I went full speed, takes about 3 min.

24
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.410
Anthony Taylor: Honest to God

25
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.670
michael mcpherson: her

26
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.049
michael mcpherson: sorry. It's growling at my dog.

27
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.149
Baro, Sonja: Can we help me? 7, 9. Tell her no.

28
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.430
michael mcpherson: he's asleep.

29
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.480
michael mcpherson: he growls in his sleep sometimes.

30
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.260
Anthony Taylor: so push. Oh, you do. Okay, alright. So you're good. Next.

31
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.990
Anthony Taylor: let's verify that address, which one is right. Second, one

32
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.560
Anthony Taylor: sign barrels

33
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.329
Anthony Taylor: and agree agree again. Oh, wait, maybe not.

34
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.950
Baro, Sonja: It's thinking it looks like it. Huh? It's thinking.

35
00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.030
Anthony Taylor: will it let you click on this?

36
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.449
Anthony Taylor: No, yeah, it's doing that little do, Hicky, down here.

37
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.639
Anthony Taylor: I wonder why?

38
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.350
Baro, Sonja: That's right. That's right. There it goes.

39
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.119
Anthony Taylor: Oh, wait. Or did you click something?

40
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:26.250
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Yeah. So you can turn off your share. For now you're just gonna put in a card again. You have a 200 credit. You're not gonna charge. You do not stress.

41
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.100
Anthony Taylor: You don't want to hide your screen.

42
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.380
Baro, Sonja: I'm not.

43
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.169
Kanouff, Christine: Yup, okay.

44
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.109
Baro, Sonja: Did I stop? Okay?

45
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:53.640
Anthony Taylor: No, you did. Fine. You're done now. Yeah, but that's alright. You're in now. So when Sonia finishes putting in her credit card.

46
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.490
Anthony Taylor: She will end up in a screen.

47
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.040
Baro, Sonja: Okay, there we go

48
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.659
Anthony Taylor: to this. They might have some other things, cause it's the first time I have a lot of stuff in mind.

49
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.280
Anthony Taylor:  but that's okay.

50
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.410
Anthony Taylor: That's okay.

51
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.560
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So

52
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:23.909
Anthony Taylor: we could do this super fast way, or I could give you guys a little bit of azure stuff since we have 30 min, and I know this isn't going to take very long. We'll also let people sign up who haven't signed up.

53
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.079
Anthony Taylor: Let's do a quick overview of what's on the screen.

54
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.610
Anthony Taylor: So this is the azure portal. This is the cloud service. Pretty much

55
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.500
Anthony Taylor: one of the top 2, and given the day of the week, it could be number one, it could be number 2.

56
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.509
Anthony Taylor: Aws is the only other one that's even close.

57
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.470
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

58
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.810
Anthony Taylor:  basically

59
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:57.670
Anthony Taylor: as a cloud provider. One of the number one things it gives us, or actually one of the first things it ever gave us

60
00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.980
Anthony Taylor: was virtual machines in the cloud. What does that mean?

61
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.870
Anthony Taylor: Imagine you need a computer that's bigger than your computer.

62
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:13.289
Anthony Taylor: What would you have had to do 10 years ago. Well, 20 years ago you would go out and buy a bigger computer.

63
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:20.659
Anthony Taylor: move all your stuff over to it, test it, hope it works thousands of dollars. And months later

64
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.920
Anthony Taylor: you have a new computer. Now, it's literally the click of a button

65
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.919
Anthony Taylor: takes about 30 s.

66
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:41.320
Anthony Taylor: Okay, to do the same thing that we used to spend 2 to 3 months doing. And I'm talking thousands of dollars. lots of job of work, hours

67
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.570
Anthony Taylor: we can now do. And

68
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.990
Anthony Taylor: minutes.

69
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.000
Anthony Taylor: Okay, which is super super cool.

70
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:55.440
Anthony Taylor: Cloud services grew immediately after, or pretty much along the same lines they created.

71
00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:01.059
Anthony Taylor: Cloud storage. cloud storage. Everyone uses it.

72
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.369
Anthony Taylor: even if you don't know you do. Google drive storage.

73
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.339
Anthony Taylor: Open our Google onedrive or Microsoft onedrive cloud storage.

74
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.059
Anthony Taylor: Okay, apple.

75
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.889
Baro, Sonja: What is the apple drive called? Is it called apple drive. I drive

76
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:26.629
Anthony Taylor: icloud file storage. Okay, they're all cloud storage.  it's actually pretty damn cheap.

77
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:36.280
Anthony Taylor: 4 and and and this was the quote I've been using for years. It's probably less than that now. But basically, it's like 0 0

78
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.189
Anthony Taylor: 4 cents per gigabyte per month.

79
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.900
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's crazy low. It's really, really cheap.

80
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:52.629
Anthony Taylor: And you get basically the full bandwidth of that provider

81
00:06:52.710 --> 00:07:00.240
Anthony Taylor: to pull your data down. And up. There is a minor charge for uploading and downloading data, but it's like

82
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:08.229
Anthony Taylor: like 5 zeroes before it even gets to a one. Okay, for every megabyte or gigabyte that you copy up and down.

83
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:10.679
Anthony Taylor: It's very, very cheap.

84
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:17.690
Anthony Taylor: Okay. A terabyte is like, I think, a terabyte like, for I want to say 40,

85
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.679
Anthony Taylor: but it might be, for I don't know. It's really cheap.

86
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.930
Anthony Taylor: Okay with that being said.

87
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:30.340
Anthony Taylor: Companies like our Drex or Hertz, 2 of the ones I've worked with recently. We spend

88
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.030
Anthony Taylor: $20,000 a month on storage.

89
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.680
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's how much storage we're storing.

90
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:46.060
Anthony Taylor: Just our data is 100 TB at arthritics. Okay, so, anyway.

91
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:55.390
Anthony Taylor:  so we have storage after storage. They started building other cool cloud services like databases in the cloud.

92
00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:01.020
Anthony Taylor: Alright, so we could create a SQL. Database in the cloud

93
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.589
Anthony Taylor: and access. Now, the cool thing about that

94
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:16.499
Anthony Taylor: databases need to be upgraded. They need better, better hardware. They need more storage. Anyone that's worked in databases has gone through this. Any of you ever gone through that

95
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:24.790
Anthony Taylor: upgrading a database at work harded. Most horrible thing you could do. Okay, now

96
00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:33.309
Anthony Taylor: I'm debt. I need double the cpus click. and

97
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.929
Anthony Taylor: I need 10 times the storage.

98
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:38.110
Anthony Taylor: I'm done.

99
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.039
Anthony Taylor: It's literally that easy now.

100
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:50.579
Anthony Taylor: After databases they started creating app services. And this is kind of where we're gonna end, that we're gonna stop.

101
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:54.730
Anthony Taylor: But app services are basically the capability to

102
00:08:54.870 --> 00:09:02.209
Anthony Taylor: run applications in the cloud. Almost every application on your phone is a cloud application.

103
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:11.710
Anthony Taylor: It may run some components on your phone, but the majority of it is pulling Apis down from a concert.

104
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:22.040
Anthony Taylor: Alright. there's other things. There's other databases there's networking. There's a lot of other things, too. But those were the main

105
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.639
Anthony Taylor: things, and of course, more recently.

106
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:30.439
Anthony Taylor: we now have Llm. Capabilities. Now Microsoft was the first

107
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:35.240
Anthony Taylor: to get Openai and basically make it part of azure.

108
00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:41.149
Anthony Taylor: What's the difference between azure open AI and open AI. Well, number one.

109
00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:45.129
Anthony Taylor: if I go in here and try to create an azure open. AI,

110
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.740
Baro, Sonja: it won't let me. I?

111
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:54.749
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And the reason is is, it's only open to business accounts.

112
00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:09.539
Anthony Taylor: Alright as yours. Open, AI. The cool thing about is yours. Open, AI. If anyone asks you at a business level is that it is not. It is. It is under the same nda

113
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:13.850
Anthony Taylor: as you and the rest of your organization that uses Microsoft.

114
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.240
Baro, Sonja: So if you have your data

115
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.760
Anthony Taylor: on Microsoft servers.

116
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:29.309
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's safe. They, I mean, they're basically they've signed agreements that they're not going to share your data. They're not going to use your data. They won't even look at your data.

117
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:30.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

118
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:39.759
Anthony Taylor: opening. Aye for azure. Same agreement. So you're guaranteed they're not gonna share. They're not gonna train. They're not gonna do anything with your day.

119
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.760
Anthony Taylor: right? Which is a good thing.

120
00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.459
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So with that being said.

121
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.649
Anthony Taylor: the way that azure

122
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:54.279
Anthony Taylor: services are are basically organized are, first, by subscription. Well, we all have one subscription.

123
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.390
Anthony Taylor: the one you just made.

124
00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:07.149
Anthony Taylor: Okay, second Level is a resource group. Now, you may not have this full icon. If you don't just go up to top and type our SO.

125
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:12.350
Anthony Taylor: And the first thing there should be a resource group. Go ahead and click on that.

126
00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:20.430
Anthony Taylor: So this is an organizational structure. We can secure things here. We can put things here that are like

127
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:31.429
Anthony Taylor: focused around a single application, maybe, or a single department. There's all kinds of ways. You can do this. We're just going to create one for ourselves. Just so we learn how to do it.

128
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.290
Anthony Taylor: So we'll hit, create.

129
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:44.260
Anthony Taylor: and the subscription is whatever subscription you guys have have set up, give it a name. The resource group name has to be somewhat unique. Well, S. Be completely unique to your account.

130
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:56.150
Anthony Taylor: to your subscription. So we'll call this at I don't know if let me do a dash. Let's find out. I always forget some of them. Let you do dashes some of them. Let you do underscores

131
00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.459
Anthony Taylor: 80 where the

132
00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.760
Anthony Taylor: dash Demo dash AI.

133
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:08.039
Anthony Taylor: So let me. Yep, okay. So that was okay. It will tell you if you put something here that is not unique.

134
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:10.200
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

135
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:21.780
Anthony Taylor: next is your region. So the cool thing about all these cloud services is that they have gigantic server rooms in every region

136
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:23.729
Anthony Taylor: pretty much in the world.

137
00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:27.799
Anthony Taylor: Why do you care? Well, you're going over the Internet.

138
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:41.009
Anthony Taylor: So what you want is to select a region that is geographically close to you. It may only save you a couple of milliseconds. But if you're generate, if you're moving a lot of data that couple of milliseconds could add up.

139
00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:41.970
Anthony Taylor: So

140
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:47.169
Anthony Taylor: go ahead for you guys, you're probably gonna go west.

141
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:51.630
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you you don't want South central. So go west.

142
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:57.499
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Hey, Anthony, if whichever like whatever resource group you create, is it

143
00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:04.610
Meredith McCanse (she/her): like available to anyone who wants to see it? Or is it just a private thing that's going to be only a

144
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:11.419
Anthony Taylor: it's only accessible by you for now everything and we're going to do today, except for the public. URL at the end

145
00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.079
Anthony Taylor: is only for you.

146
00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:21.859
Anthony Taylor: You could do West Central us. But don't do that. Just stick with one of the main ones, for now, because some services aren't available in every region.

147
00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:33.030
Anthony Taylor: so just stick with either West or don't do east, do West, us 2 or 3. Okay. alright. So once you're done with that, just do review and create.

148
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:38.380
Anthony Taylor: It'll make sure your name is okay, and then create and hit the create that.

149
00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:48.710
Anthony Taylor: And as soon as it's done up at the top here, a little button will come up and go ahead and hit go to resource group.

150
00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:55.550
Anthony Taylor: Now, we're not gonna do anything in this window. But I just wanna show you what's gonna happen.

151
00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:03.410
Anthony Taylor: Everything we create today, we're gonna put. That's funny, Demo. We're gonna put in this resource group

152
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:08.340
Anthony Taylor: and it will show up right down here. Okay.

153
00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:15.200
Anthony Taylor: why do I do this? Well, when I'm done. If I want to get rid of all of this, all I got to do is come to this research group.

154
00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:19.580
Anthony Taylor: delete it. and everything that's included will go away with.

155
00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:29.509
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so it's just organization and security. I can come in here and say what people could do

156
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:38.879
Anthony Taylor: in this resource group with the things I create. So this is where I would like Admins. Like, I decide, Meredith, she's gonna admin this website, we're gonna make.

157
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:47.929
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So I can give her access to be that admin, but and still get the rest of your access to see it, but not necessarily access to admin.

158
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.980
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. So go back to home.

159
00:14:51.610 --> 00:15:10.449
Anthony Taylor: So to do this static website, we need a place to store our website. Now, remember, in slack, under extra reviews, I gave you all the Zip file. It's like index. Zip. Be sure you have that somewhere where you can find it and unzipped because we're going to copy that into this file in just a minute.

160
00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:13.370
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So let's go to storage accounts.

161
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:19.220
Anthony Taylor: Notice, I have a bunch of them. Just so you guys know all of these storage accounts.

162
00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.069
Anthony Taylor: My azure bill every month is 0.

163
00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:31.030
Anthony Taylor: I don't pay a dime for this, and not because I do anything with them. I just don't have enough stuff to register their

164
00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:32.470
Anthony Taylor: their price tags.

165
00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.230
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So it's pretty short.

166
00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:41.240
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Anthony, will you show how you got to the storage account since I looked down for

167
00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:44.429
Anthony Taylor: back to the search at the top and just type storage

168
00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:49.340
Anthony Taylor: and then storage storage accounts. Thank you, Yup.

169
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:56.630
Anthony Taylor: and that's for anything. By the way, anything you can even think of. You can get your help, docs. You can get all kinds of stuff just typing up here and searchable.

170
00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:02.809
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So now that we're here. We're gonna do create. All of you should have nothing in here right? Pretty much.

171
00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.719
Anthony Taylor: So go ahead and hit create.

172
00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:12.189
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna walk through this little mini. So first under Resource group, select that resource group you just created.

173
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:21.440
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that means that this resource, this storage account, will be created in that resource group

174
00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:30.550
Anthony Taylor: just as a little heads up. You could have just come straight here and knock on resource group and create a new one from here to see it.

175
00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:37.359
Anthony Taylor: So the storage account name. Now, this one's interesting, this one has to be unique

176
00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:51.540
Anthony Taylor: across the globe. No one in the world can have whatever you typing. So be creative. Use your initials. whatever. So like. TT.

177
00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:57.600
Anthony Taylor: Web. Demo AI,

178
00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:01.980
Anthony Taylor: hey, mine work. Don't type what I type won't work

179
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:10.499
Anthony Taylor: alright. So try to type something. Just it doesn't really matter. It will come up in the URL whatever you put here.

180
00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:11.430
Anthony Taylor: but

181
00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:17.689
Anthony Taylor: just realize it's there. It's yeah, it's unlikely you're gonna get something totally fine.

182
00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:26.629
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So since we're in this build, the storage count, we still have 10 min to go. I will explain the storage account, too.

183
00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:31.729
Anthony Taylor: So this is basically going to create a logical hard drive on the Internet

184
00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:46.429
Anthony Taylor: with infinite and infinite is a strong word. But for all intents and purposes, infinite amounts of storage. You want to store one, Meg, you can do it. You want to store

185
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.249
Anthony Taylor: a thousand terabytes. You can do it.

186
00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:55.589
Anthony Taylor: and they will scale to you. They will charge you by the gig

187
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.440
Anthony Taylor: for everything you put in here. That's how they make their money.

188
00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.889
Anthony Taylor: Okay, the cool thing is, you notice down here

189
00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:11.869
Anthony Taylor: there's these options locally redundant. Geo. Redundant zone redundant. Geo. Zone redundant.

190
00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:20.400
Anthony Taylor: Alright! What is that? Everything you put on this cloud disk will be copied somewhere else.

191
00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:25.580
Anthony Taylor: so that if this cloud disk fails, you have backup without

192
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:27.729
Anthony Taylor: remembering to back it up.

193
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:40.519
Anthony Taylor: Now, local redundant basically means that it's going to be in the same geographic location. Mine is east us. That means it's going to be in the East, Us. Area.

194
00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:45.720
Anthony Taylor: That's great unless the entire East US. Goes down. That has happened

195
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:50.450
Anthony Taylor: to aws. It happened like 3 times a couple of years ago.

196
00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.899
Anthony Taylor: The whole east coast just dropped.

197
00:18:54.250 --> 00:19:03.099
Anthony Taylor: Okay. if you do, Geo. Redundance. it will keep a copy of your data in another geographical location.

198
00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:11.910
Anthony Taylor: You don't get to pick unless you want to pay more. But it doesn't matter. It's not. If East Coast goes down. You could redirect to that other location

199
00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:17.669
Anthony Taylor: alright and get your same data. which is a very smart thing to do.

200
00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:24.540
Anthony Taylor: The Geo and zone our. Our zone is like multiple in the same area.

201
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:36.399
Anthony Taylor: So you'll have east us one East. Us 2 East. Us 3 is his own Geo and zone is, you'll have multiple geographies, multiple zones. It's like, Be safe.

202
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.170
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's also the most expensive.

203
00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:47.919
Anthony Taylor: Alright, we really don't even need this. So we'll just do locally if you want. You don't have to change it. It's not gonna cost you thing. Don't worry about it.

204
00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:53.100
Anthony Taylor: If we wanted to, we'll just go to advance. We're not gonna change anything here.

205
00:19:53.480 --> 00:20:03.539
Anthony Taylor: Okay, just notice there's some stuff here. We've got secure. Transfer rest. Api. There is an Api that you can use to get to the storage you're gonna create.

206
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:09.189
Anthony Taylor: Allow anonymous. Don't check that unless you want just any old person read or

207
00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.880
Anthony Taylor: messing with your files?

208
00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:18.649
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna have storage count access. We don't need it for what we're doing today, but that's a way to let applications access

209
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.100
Anthony Taylor: your data if you want them to.

210
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:29.469
Anthony Taylor: Intra authorization. They used to call it Active Directory. For some reason they recently changed it to Intra.

211
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.590
Baro, Sonja: Okay, you will still see both.

212
00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:36.110
Anthony Taylor: But in the cloud they call it Intel. Okay.

213
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:41.330
Anthony Taylor: Tls version. Don't worry about the don't you have either one of these? They're not

214
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:55.680
Baro, Sonja: okay for what we're doing.

215
00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:02.390
Baro, Sonja: So active Directory, it's what they renamed it in.

216
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:05.069
Anthony Taylor: So if you go here.

217
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.780
Anthony Taylor: this is actually active Directory right now.

218
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:10.919
Baro, Sonja: but it cause if you try to type active directory.

219
00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:20.090
Anthony Taylor: it it no longer shows up. And they call it yeah, but that I don't know if that's happened on on domain servers like on site.

220
00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:27.720
Anthony Taylor: But I could tell you it's definitely happened in 5. Okay, this is important right here. So

221
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:37.979
Anthony Taylor: and and I'm I'm gonna tell you guys, some aws stuff here. Aws, has a product called S 3, which is basically the same thing that you're using right now. The storage account.

222
00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.840
Anthony Taylor: They only have s. 3. That's it.

223
00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:47.560
Anthony Taylor: On azure. You get the option of hierarchical

224
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:50.970
Anthony Taylor: storage or blob storage

225
00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:53.030
Anthony Taylor: the difference.

226
00:21:53.050 --> 00:22:07.380
Anthony Taylor: Hierarchical storage is designed to optimize data, retrieval and writing bottom line is, is it allows us to do a lot of parallel rights? That's really what it does.

227
00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:16.399
Anthony Taylor: If you were to be setting this up for data like for to access or write data, you would check this box.

228
00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:20.449
Anthony Taylor: Don't stress it, you can actually check it later if you forget.

229
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:25.640
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But this is this creates Adls 2,

230
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:31.260
Anthony Taylor: which is what I use like for all of my stuff. Okay.

231
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:43.520
Anthony Taylor: anyway. We're not gonna mess with networking. We're not gonna mess with cross origin. Just gonna keep all moving. So here's the networking settings we are gonna leave everything alone

232
00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:54.199
Anthony Taylor: by. But by doing public access from all networks. This is one of the reasons we're going to be able to do our web stuff. Microsoft. Routing is enough. Don't need to change that.

233
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:57.709
Anthony Taylor: We could come in here and in in enable encryption.

234
00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.689
Anthony Taylor: This one has soft delete.

235
00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:08.860
Anthony Taylor: which means, if you delete something, it's actually kind of still there for 7 days. You just can't see it. Think of it like a automatic recycle bit.

236
00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:16.330
Anthony Taylor: Anything that gets deleted is still there for 7 days. What's that good for? And you have idiots that

237
00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:19.309
Anthony Taylor: delete something that they shouldn't have deleted.

238
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:25.539
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this is. And by default, this is because there's more idiots than not.

239
00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:26.460
This kid.

240
00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.140
Anthony Taylor: Nobody's in giddy.

241
00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:40.509
Anthony Taylor: Here's our encryption. We can actually use their switches with a lot of people. Some more security. Conscious companies will do their own queues. Okay, that makes them feel warm and fuzzy

242
00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:53.969
Anthony Taylor: because they're managing them versus Microsoft and we can say what we want them to. Do this the last thing one of that time. The last thing is, tags. Tags are used for pricing

243
00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.070
Anthony Taylor: pretty much

244
00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:59.509
Anthony Taylor: alright and and tracking and stuff like that. So I'm gonna review it.

245
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:01.890
Anthony Taylor: And then I'm going to create it.

246
00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:04.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

247
00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.679
Anthony Taylor: So it's deploying.

248
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:14.109
Anthony Taylor: you would think I'm worried. I'm actually not. We're still gonna be done on time. I'm not joking. It's that easy.

249
00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:22.330
Anthony Taylor: So as soon as this deploys. So all this is doing basically is building up underneath.

250
00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:25.540
Anthony Taylor: It's it's allocating storage for us.

251
00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.849
Anthony Taylor: So as soon as it's done allocating that storage.

252
00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.139
Anthony Taylor: There we go. We'll click. Go to resource

253
00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:43.340
Anthony Taylor: now, right now, if you were to go look at this, and and one way you can go look at it is storage browser over here on the left.

254
00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:48.560
Anthony Taylor: Click, storage browser and go to blob containers.

255
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.639
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And you'll see there's nothing in.

256
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:56.450
Anthony Taylor: But this is the story. This is, Dick.

257
00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:08.780
Anthony Taylor: You can put whatever you want in here. We're not gonna put anything in it right now. Okay. so everybody saw how to get there. There is a cool tool called storage explorer.

258
00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:13.500
Anthony Taylor:  Then you can let me see if I have it. I might have

259
00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:25.680
Anthony Taylor: probably do, because I talk about it a lot. Anyway, it's an app you can install that lets you kind of see everything like a like a I can and explore

260
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:29.179
and it's very cool. We'll come back to that in just a sec.

261
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.810
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So let's conate our website.

262
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.270

Anthony Taylor: paste it in your address bar.

275
00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:36.349
Anthony Taylor: and if this happens, don't sled it. Just give it a few seconds.

276
00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:39.189
Anthony Taylor: You might get this at first.

277
00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.030

285

Anthony Taylor: Come on, now.

286
00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.440
Anthony Taylor: has anybody's come up yet?

287
00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:24.550
Anthony Taylor: It does take a second for it to deploy. Don't sweat it too much. Oh.

288
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.390
Anthony Taylor: I'm sorry, guys. Hold on. I forgot the important part.

294
00:27:50.570 --> 00:28:04.510
Anthony Taylor: And now that stuff I gave you earlier. I want you to copy those, or take those 3 files and drag them and drop them right there, or you can browse whatever you prefer.

295
00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.950
Anthony Taylor: It'll say 3 files ready to be uploaded. Just click upload.

296
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And now

297
00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:16.949
Anthony Taylor: go to your website

298
00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.359

300
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:23.909
Meredith McCanse (she/her): It worked for me.

301
00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:25.440
Anthony Taylor: Okay, good.

302
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:28.800
Anthony Taylor: I must have done something weird. But anyway.

303
00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:42.020
Anthony Taylor: upload, drop it or you can browse.

304
00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.829
Baro, Sonja: I just wasn't finding that

305
00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.710
Baro, Sonja: I got it. We're fine. We're fine

306
00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:55.570
Anthony Taylor: and and like I said, they don't all come up instantly. Okay, if they don't, don't worry about it. Just

307
00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.840
Anthony Taylor: keep trying. You should see something like this when you're done.

308
00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.710
Baro, Sonja: is working for most of you.

309
00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:13.599
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, drop all 3 of them. I'm actually going to disable and save and enable and do it again.

310
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:17.809
Anthony Taylor: If mine's taking way too much that normally ticked out.

311
00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:23.650
Anthony Taylor: let's say a minute or 2, but mine seems to be really low.

312
00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:29.950
Baro, Sonja: So once you put them in there, do you need to do anything else to out? Make the call?

313
00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:34.219
Anthony Taylor: No, you just gotta take your URL and bring it out.

314
00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.400
Baro, Sonja: hey?

315
00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:38.300

318
00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:49.979
Meredith McCanse (she/her): alright. So I'm gonna see? Is this working for most everybody

319
00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:56.680
Anthony Taylor: anybody did didn't work that that was able to go through it all. I'm gonna stop. The recording is all I'm asking.

320
00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:59.960
Anthony Taylor: Alright, good job. Everybody.
