1
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:13.209
Anthony Taylor: Right then, let's finish up Visualization day 3. And, by the way, I did confirm sort of

2
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:27.780
Anthony Taylor: one of the other instructors announced that there was no MoD. 7, challenge, and he was like, What are we supposed to do? And I said, we went forward with No. MoD. 7 challenge. and nobody argued with me. So that is the way it is.

3
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:44.669
Anthony Taylor: So there are no challenges for this particular module. So feel free to catch up anyone that's behind. Please do. You're doing great if anybody, and not that I want to. Just jack that score up even more. But if anybody got a better score, so you know.

4
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.519
Anthony Taylor: can resubmit so you can take the feedback.

5
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.580
Anthony Taylor: fix it, and then resubmit it if you choose to. If you decide you want to, but it's pass fail, of course.

6
00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.259
Anthony Taylor:  The only thing I would say, I think one of you might've got like a 50,

7
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:11.500
Anthony Taylor: which that's the same as not doing the challenge. So make sure if you got that, if you got the lowest 60 resubmit, fix, fix the few things and resubmit it. Okay, because

8
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:21.879
Anthony Taylor: in the end that will count against you as a not being done, you can miss 2, I think, without any issue. But after, if you miss more than 2. Then

9
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.930
Anthony Taylor: that's not good. Okay, anyway. Enough. Yes, Mike.

10
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.090
michael mcpherson: I thought the bottom 2 weren't counted.

11
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:44.139
Anthony Taylor: You can miss 2. So if the bottom are those 2? You're okay. If you did them all, and you only got 2 below 60, you're good.

12
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.680
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. I also have one below 60 cause I quit on this one

13
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.570
Anthony Taylor: I got about. I got about 30Â h into it. And I'm like.

14
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.699
michael mcpherson: I'm just. It's just not gonna happen.

15
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.870
Anthony Taylor: Well, maybe when you get the feedback. They'll give you just enough that you can

16
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:09.429
Anthony Taylor: jack it up a little bit if you want to. It's not necessary. I've just Clayton didn't know that earlier. He had one that got a little low, and and I told him, and he was very, very pleased. So

17
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:23.879
Anthony Taylor: anyway, I just want to make sure. All of, okay. So what are we gonna do today? Well, we're gonna talk about a lot of stats we've already talked about. First, we're gonna talk about the central tendency stuff, how to calculate mean median and mode.

18
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:35.570
Anthony Taylor: We're going to talk about box plots and how to calculate outliers and visualize outlier. We're also going to look at the Sem

19
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.849
Anthony Taylor: stuff guys. Remember the Sem

20
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:46.490
Anthony Taylor: where we had multiple populations. And we were seeing if they were statistically significant. Okay?

21
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:53.129
Anthony Taylor:  So those 3 things we literally have all done already in this class.

22
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.060
Anthony Taylor: So it's not gonna hurt us to have some refresher.

23
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.640
Anthony Taylor: We'll knock those out.

24
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:07.120
Anthony Taylor: After that, we're going to start getting into correlation. Now, we've talked about correlation. We haven't like, literally calculated correlation.

25
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:14.219
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we're going to calculate correlation. And then we're going to actually make some predictions

26
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.480
Anthony Taylor: using linear regression. Now.

27
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.190
Anthony Taylor: Well, just wait. I will wait to get there before I tell you the

28
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.640
Anthony Taylor: cautions with that.

29
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:26.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

30
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.330
Anthony Taylor: So

31
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:44.790
Anthony Taylor: some reminders, normal distribution has the 68, 95 99.7 rule. Okay, every there, 68% of your data is is within one standard deviation of mean.

32
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.020
Anthony Taylor: whether it be positive or negative.

33
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.320
Anthony Taylor: Okay, 95% of it is within 2

34
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:59.569
Anthony Taylor: 98 99.7 is within 3. This is assuming perfect

35
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:00.990
Anthony Taylor: distribution.

36
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.799
Anthony Taylor: Alright. And it happens.

37
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.340
Anthony Taylor: okay.

38
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.249
Anthony Taylor: that was quick.

39
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.599
Anthony Taylor: We're already on Demos. Okay.

40
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.390
Anthony Taylor: so let's go up here and let's go through.

41
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:26.320
Anthony Taylor: And again, this is, I'll study you guys. It's theme. So if you have any trouble or you have any questions, please ask. But

42
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.430
Anthony Taylor: hopefully. We remember some of it.

43
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.870
Clayton Graves: I went through a lot of this

44
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:35.700
Clayton Graves: early.

45
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:42.149
Clayton Graves: One of the things that I had a problem with, and I'm hoping that you'll explain it when we get to it.

46
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:54.660
Anthony Taylor: What, exactly is this box plot? Because I don't understand what it is okay, or how to read it. II will absolutely will do that. That's the second demo. And I will explain it in great detail.

47
00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:06.039
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So the first one we're gonna just look at mean Median and mode. Alright. And mostly this is to remind you guys how we do it. We do mean and median with numpy

48
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.790
Anthony Taylor: and you just do. Np, dot me past in your your data.

49
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:19.630
Anthony Taylor: and it will give you the mean Np Median passive data. It'll give in.

50
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.070
Anthony Taylor: And for

51
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.870
Anthony Taylor: mode we use Stypi. That's this library.

52
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:36.049
Anthony Taylor: and we'll do St. Mode. Pass it. Heat dens. You don't have to do that, but and then that'll give you the move

53
00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.319
Anthony Taylor: and see. And so that gives you that. So let's run that

54
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.660
Anthony Taylor: mean medium mode. These look good.

55
00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:56.220
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I'm trying to remember. I'm looking at the structure of this, like the data in the Csv, do we? Do you have to specify what it?

56
00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:04.639
Anthony Taylor: What it's taking the mean of like, I know, we're specifying. There's only one number for it to work.

57
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:13.760
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Would it do? Does it do any column that has numeric data, or I'm sorry I don't remember. I know, we talked

58
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.880
Anthony Taylor: the temperatures right here.

59
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.130
Anthony Taylor: Okay, see? Right here, this is where we're creating temperatures.

60
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.950
Anthony Taylor: So we're only using the dry bulb temperature.

61
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:28.459
Anthony Taylor: This one

62
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:43.290
Meredith McCanse (she/her): got it. So we did specify. I got it so. And remember, this will be a series. And that's what we have to pass into.

63
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:49.350
Anthony Taylor: Np, dot, main and Mp, dot, media. okay, okay, no good call.

64
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.679
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So now we're gonna take that same series, create a histogram.

65
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.360
Anthony Taylor: We'll take a good look at this. Is that a normal distribution

66
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:09.190
Anthony Taylor: mostly. Yeah, mostly. Well, but we could check for sure if we really wanted to. Let's get our variance.

67
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.470
Anthony Taylor: Okay, is everybody. Remember what variance is.

68
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:24.489
Anthony Taylor: it's basically the distance from the mean of all of your data.

69
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:32.690
Anthony Taylor: Okay, standard deviation. We like standard deviation better because it's this, the we square up the

70
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.330
Anthony Taylor: the variance, and we end up getting it in the same unit. So variance is just a measurement.

71
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.549
Anthony Taylor: But standard deviation in this case will be temperature.

72
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:49.659
Anthony Taylor: All right. So we've run this we could see, okay, well, variance was 32.3 3. What does that mean? I don't.

73
00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:57.749
Anthony Taylor: But I know what this one standard deviation is 5.6 8, which, if we break this up

74
00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.380
Anthony Taylor: right 5.6 8, take you about to hear.

75
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.100
Anthony Taylor: And to here.

76
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:12.010
Anthony Taylor: Okay, there's that where that 68% hopefully falls into play. This isn't perfectly distributed. So it may not.

77
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:22.400
Anthony Taylor: Okay. all right. so here we can see. Because we now have the standard deviation. We can actually say

78
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:30.560
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna we're gonna calculate that 68, 95 99.7. So I don't think we did this before, so let me explain what we're doing here.

79
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:39.509
Anthony Taylor: We're going to take the mean. subtract this number and round it to 3 digits.

80
00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:45.340
Anthony Taylor: all right. So that so we're subtracting it. Which means we're going

81
00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:55.160
Anthony Taylor: this direction and calculating this. then we're going to calculate this one by simply adding one standard deviation

82
00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:58.859
Anthony Taylor: to our values. So this will give us

83
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:06.720
Anthony Taylor: 68% of the data. The next one. All we're gonna do is subtract 2, or we're gonna subtract

84
00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:12.349
Anthony Taylor: 2 times this number that'll give us 5, 10

85
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:18.039
Anthony Taylor: closer to 12, actually, but still. And then the same on the left. 5.

86
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.210
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, okay?

87
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.380
Anthony Taylor: And then the last one, we're going to multiply by 3. So it'd be

88
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.139
Anthony Taylor: 5, 1015

89
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:38.050
Anthony Taylor: way out here. way out here. Everybody understand what each one of these is doing okay, we're gonna round it and we get picked. So this is saying that

90
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:44.039
Anthony Taylor: all of the values between 51 and 63. If this was normally distributed

91
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.569
Anthony Taylor: should be 68% of our data.

92
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.739
Anthony Taylor: is it? We didn't calculate that?

93
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.880
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we simply said.

94
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:56.459
Anthony Taylor: if this is perfectly distributed. This would be 68% of our data.

95
00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:58.160
Anthony Taylor: and then

96
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.980
Anthony Taylor: 95 99.7.

97
00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:04.300
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

98
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:09.290
Anthony Taylor: which is probably pretty close. Well, so you can see? Because the way this tail is.

99
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:18.630
Anthony Taylor: see how 40.5 9 7. That's almost like the lowest temperature. but 75 or 74.7 1 3. That's like right here.

100
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:27.349
Anthony Taylor: right? So we can tell it's not perfect, but it's still pretty good alright, and then see if I remember what the D score is.

101
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.399
Anthony Taylor: there's 2 factors of the Z score that's important.

102
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.070
Anthony Taylor: and I remember

103
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:43.470
Anthony Taylor: no. Well, the first thing about the Z-score is, it's calculated per value.

104
00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:54.459
Anthony Taylor: The second thing. And what? And really, the definition of a Z-score is, it's how many standard deviations a value is from the mean.

105
00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.839
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So when we look at this.

106
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.899
Anthony Taylor: we can see. So value one

107
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:06.460
Anthony Taylor: is to the left of the mean by

108
00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.930
Anthony Taylor: negative, 1.1 7 standard deviations.

109
00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:14.280
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so let's go look at value. One well have to look in here.

110
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.119
Anthony Taylor: So value one was 52 degrees.

111
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.550
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And our me was.

112
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.920
Anthony Taylor: that's our standard deviation.

113
00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.840
Anthony Taylor: Our mean was 57 degrees. So yeah.

114
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.720
Anthony Taylor: it's a little bit over 6,

115
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:36.410
Anthony Taylor: you know. 6 degrees lower. Okay.

116
00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:42.539
Anthony Taylor: that's it. So that's the reminder of central tendencies. Okay, that's what you're

117
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.369
Anthony Taylor: what you should remember.

118
00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:52.819
Anthony Taylor: real world. You should definitely know what these words mean.

119
00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.769
Anthony Taylor: Median, mean mode

120
00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:01.750
Anthony Taylor: and standard deviation. People will say variants to you.

121
00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:08.159
Anthony Taylor: I have found most people are not actually looking for the variance. They wanted to know the standard deviation.

122
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:17.629
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So if someone says, Well, what's the variance. You can say with a standard deviation is 5.6, because truth is, no one cares about the variable.

123
00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.710
Anthony Taylor: It's not readable.

124
00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.200
Anthony Taylor: Standard deviation makes perfect sense to everyone.

125
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:31.220
Anthony Taylor: Okay. and that's if they z score

126
00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.630
Anthony Taylor: enough about that.

127
00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.390
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so fox clubs.

128
00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:48.590
Anthony Taylor: So box plots are a way for us to visualize distribution of our data similar to this histogram.

129
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.370
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

130
00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:59.449
Anthony Taylor: just in a different format. And I think far more information is found in a box plot. But

131
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:07.900
Anthony Taylor: it will show us if we are perfectly distributed, and I'll show you. So here we have some data. 96, 98, etc., etc.

132
00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:11.130
Anthony Taylor: We're going to calculate. We're going to

133
00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.530
Anthony Taylor: for box plots, remember, we had to do this little subplot first

134
00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:18.420
Anthony Taylor: and then title label, and then we pass in data.

135
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.300
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then we're going to show it.

136
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:25.289
Anthony Taylor: So if this was normally distributed perfectly.

137
00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:29.469
Anthony Taylor: would there be any dots outside of the of these whiskers?

138
00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:43.389
Anthony Taylor: Absolutely not. Okay. Cause that means that all of our data fits within the the range we expect. Okay. so looking at this.

139
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:45.880
Anthony Taylor: we have our mean

140
00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:53.850
Anthony Taylor: right there. That's the line in the box are. And and the rest of this is quartiles.

141
00:13:54.500 --> 00:14:00.000
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we have a first, second, third, fourth, 4 times.

142
00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:05.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay, what we care about when we are calculating outliers.

143
00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.689
Anthony Taylor: Well, okay, hold on. Let me back up.

144
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:16.420
Anthony Taylor: This is the second and third quartile. What's important is is if it falls outside from whiskers, if it's if it's an outlier.

145
00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.509
Anthony Taylor: But how do we get that? Calculate?

146
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.939
Anthony Taylor: We take the total. So we subtract

147
00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:25.399
Anthony Taylor: the third quartile from the second quartile.

148
00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:29.250
Anthony Taylor: And for above we add

149
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:39.480
Anthony Taylor: 1.5 times this entire rate. So we basically want to say anything bigger than this, and 50% more

150
00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:45.079
Anthony Taylor: that we consider an outlier. So that's going to fall outside of these whiskers.

151
00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:47.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

152
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:57.499
Anthony Taylor:  the only thing good about box plots is, they very quickly can show you if you have potential outlier.

153
00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:02.460
Anthony Taylor: That's it. right? They're they're great way to demonstrate

154
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.800
Anthony Taylor: your data, and how

155
00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.839
Anthony Taylor: messy it might be so if you do this, and you have just.

156
00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:17.429
Anthony Taylor: you know, 100 dots on either side, like the La Times, weather one or the la, but the next one we're gonna do.

157
00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:21.920
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that is potentially just too dirty to play with.

158
00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:23.980
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

159
00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:32.599
Anthony Taylor: But the main thing, what you're looking at in this case, if I saw this I would go. I don't care about this one, but I want to know what's going on here.

160
00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.949
Anthony Taylor: So if I, as a data, scientist data, engineer, data analyst. Even.

161
00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:46.390
Anthony Taylor: I would go back because of this. And this is such an outlier. I would go back to whoever gathered this data and say, Hey, what happened?

162
00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:47.990
Anthony Taylor: What was this?

163
00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:52.109
Anthony Taylor: Probably I don't know. That's probably the answer you're getting.

164
00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:55.609
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. In that case it's tropical.

165
00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:59.429
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But yeah.

166
00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:10.400
Anthony Taylor: so that's that is what this is. It's a way to visualize the distribution of your data in a far more accurate way than just to Instagram.

167
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:21.920
Anthony Taylor: Okay, histogram gives us a really high level. This gives you a much closer look at your data distribution. Okay?

168
00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.949
Anthony Taylor: And then, if we wanted to see the data sorted.

169
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:30.590
Anthony Taylor: it becomes really obvious that that number does not seem right.

170
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:34.169
Anthony Taylor: That's really all there is to.

171
00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:37.019
Anthony Taylor: Does that help playing with the box plot?

172
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:45.999
Clayton Graves: So good data would all fit within that top bar and that bottom bar. Right?

173
00:16:46.530 --> 00:17:00.620
Anthony Taylor: II wanna be careful with the term good data, because just because it's not normally distributed doesn't make it wrong. I mean there any. But as long as it's close to this box, then we feel confident that we can use it.

174
00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:06.089
Anthony Taylor: You have a lot of stuff that's like, you know, like I said, you're gonna see it in the student one.

175
00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:11.049
Anthony Taylor:  then you have to decide if it's worth using. Or

176
00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:23.079
Anthony Taylor: I mean, if someone said, someone actually had a reaction time of 5Â ms. Okay. it's not really an outlier. Yes, it's a. Let me give you an example.

177
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:26.080
Anthony Taylor: Michael Jordan. Everybody know who Michael Jordan.

178
00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:32.870
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I know it's it's getting to the point now where that was so long ago that young people are like, Who's that?

179
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:34.399
Anthony Taylor: You spent an actor?

180
00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:39.020
Anthony Taylor: No, okay. Michael Jordan was an anomaly. He was an outlier

181
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.299
Anthony Taylor: in almost every category.

182
00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:45.679
Anthony Taylor: Okay, he did not make his High School basketball team.

183
00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.419
Anthony Taylor: This doesn't happen for Nba players.

184
00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:54.769
Anthony Taylor: Okay, he comes into the Nba. And he's like, and Mvp. First year. It happens not very often.

185
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:59.680
Anthony Taylor: his scoring, his rebound. Everything about this guy was an outlier.

186
00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.250
Anthony Taylor: alright. How much money he made.

187
00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.760
Anthony Taylor: how smart he was every day outliers.

188
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:15.909
Anthony Taylor: But it's a real thing. So here's the question. If you are judging and Nba players, does Michael Jordan belong in the database?

189
00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:20.579
Anthony Taylor: Right? Everyone compares and compares to Michael Jordan

190
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:30.459
Anthony Taylor: Kobe. He's the next Michael. Well, was the next. Michael Jordan is. The next is second Michael Jordan Lebron. He's greater than Michael Jordan.

191
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:33.869
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I guarantee you, Lebron.

192
00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:42.080
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So anyway, the the point is is that outliers do exist, and they're not always wrong.

193
00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:54.379
Anthony Taylor: So we still have to use our analytics to come up with. Well. is it wrong? Is it really an outlier? Do we want to dump it, cause it will skew our data badly

194
00:18:54.580 --> 00:19:00.839
Anthony Taylor: the average of our data, the mean of our data with this outlier really low.

195
00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:07.790
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you get rid of that. Armine is way up in, you know way high.

196
00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.569
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but this can really skew your data?

197
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.339
Anthony Taylor: Yes, Christine.

198
00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:19.360
Kanouff, Christine: so is the just a reminder. Is that

199
00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:27.179
Kanouff, Christine: figure one axis, one plus subplots. Is that? What's that? What creates

200
00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:30.150
Kanouff, Christine: the box plot? Pick?

201
00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.949
Anthony Taylor: This creates a canvas where we can put the boxpot.

202
00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:45.400
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this is what creates the box plot. So we're saying, put it in to this axis, and this allows us to create more than one box flat on the single pan. That's all.

203
00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:48.979
Anthony Taylor: So like, if we wanted to do a second one, we could

204
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.970
Anthony Taylor: do like an acts 2,

205
00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:55.250
Anthony Taylor: and it would be in the same canvas. But there'd be another box button.

206
00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:58.270
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

207
00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:06.539
Anthony Taylor: alright. I can tell you guys all confidence in world 30 years. I've never created box plot while working

208
00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:07.930
Anthony Taylor: effort.

209
00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I've never even. I've never even seen one

210
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:14.290
Anthony Taylor: created ever

211
00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:17.880
Anthony Taylor: alright. But

212
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:28.240
Anthony Taylor: that's why, because we do it mathematically. We don't do it with the visual at. So that's all. Hi. so we have an expert

213
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:35.520
Anthony Taylor: with the box plot. So you got reboot. I think you guys have actually done this one before

214
00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:43.350
Anthony Taylor: you're going to filter the data into hourly drywall temperature, create a boxplot to visualize it. use pandas to calculate quartiles.

215
00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:49.369
Anthony Taylor: display the values. Use the I. QR, you guys, remember the IQR. Calculation does tell you, both of us.

216
00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:55.920
Anthony Taylor: So see what I was telling you about all the outliers here. Lots of.

217
00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:00.069
Anthony Taylor: But it's awful lot of data in the minutes. It's probably okay.

218
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:09.139
Anthony Taylor:  I know we talked about it, but I don't know.

219
00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.000
McKimmy, Brandon: We if we set it.

220
00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:16.100
McKimmy, Brandon: did I show it to you already today. Yeah.

221
00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.359
McKimmy, Brandon: it's not today.

222
00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:20.169
Anthony Taylor: not today. Alright. Well, let me show it to you.

223
00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.920
sonja baro: Yeah.

224
00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:24.889
Anthony Taylor: So that you guys have it fresh.

225
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:31.510
Anthony Taylor: Cause I don't know why they would have you to it without showing it yet.

226
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:34.399
Anthony Taylor: So one sec.

227
00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:43.939
Anthony Taylor: And maybe this is their way of saying, well, see, you did this before.

228
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.440
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so

229
00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:51.799
Anthony Taylor: I'm just gonna put this in slack. So basically, what I'm doing is I'm putting this bell.

230
00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:58.580
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to put this cell in slack and lets you guys have that?

231
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:05.620
Anthony Taylor: The rest I think you guys can handle

232
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.550
Anthony Taylor: shouldn't be a problem.

233
00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:09.870
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Okay.

234
00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:11.880
sonja baro: Anthony.

235
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:13.510
Anthony Taylor: welcome back.

236
00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:16.500
Anthony Taylor: How'd you guys do any issues?

237
00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:19.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay, good.

238
00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:22.550
Anthony Taylor: Let's go through it.

239
00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.050
Anthony Taylor: Oh.

240
00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:26.350
room.

241
00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:31.560
Anthony Taylor: okay?

242
00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:36.110
Anthony Taylor: Dependency.

243
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:45.510
Anthony Taylor: So first thing we had to do load the file, then grab the jive temperature like we did in one of the demos.

244
00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:52.389
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna just do the same box plus. So this is exactly the same as what you do. The example

245
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:56.159
Anthony Taylor: I do is, change out the titles pretty much, and the data.

246
00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:15.600
Anthony Taylor: And we can see this. So again, we look at this, there's quite a few outliers there kind of depends on like, how's the data and everything else? Because these whiskers are so huge? Probably. Okay with this. But you would still want to at least check and see if there was any like problem readings. Or was this this just unusual temperatures?

247
00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.060
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

248
00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:20.309
Anthony Taylor: we use the quantile

249
00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:24.970
Anthony Taylor: method with our data. And and we tell it we want.

250
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:31.099
Anthony Taylor: you know, point 2 5.5 point 7 5, which gives us 2, 3, and 4

251
00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:34.580
Anthony Taylor: right of the Quantile or the portiles.

252
00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:41.540
Anthony Taylor: Then we get the lower quartile. We get the upper quartile. We subtract the 2 to get our I. QR.

253
00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:44.410
Anthony Taylor: And then that gets output here.

254
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:50.769
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we can also see the mean by asking for the point 5 or the medium. Sorry.

255
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:54.049
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Now, to get

256
00:23:54.110 --> 00:24:00.999
Anthony Taylor: our outlier range. We're going to say the lower bound is the lower quartile, minus

257
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:03.549
Anthony Taylor: 1.5 times Iqr.

258
00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:07.550
Anthony Taylor: Our upper bound is the upper quartile.

259
00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:13.419
Anthony Taylor: plus 1.5 times IQ. Up alright, and then that will give us

260
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:14.780
Anthony Taylor: anything

261
00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.960
Anthony Taylor: below. This could be an outlier. That's important.

262
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:24.540
Anthony Taylor: Anything above this could be an outline. Okay.

263
00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:32.210
Anthony Taylor: so these are important statements. Could you need to investigate? Don't just assume

264
00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:41.010
Anthony Taylor: that this or this is is accurate. You need to look at how they gather data and determine if it's a problem. Yes, sir.

265
00:24:41.920 --> 00:25:08.069
sonja baro: So I just wanna confirm my understanding because before we went to the the activity, you made a distinction that this was the graph is a visual representation, and that you'd like to do with the the qualitative right versus the quantitative. So if the graph is the qualitative, then this addition, the cells below were our quantitative

266
00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:13.409
sonja baro: way. What really representing what was in that visual graph

267
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:17.339
sonja baro: but more detail. Okay, I just wanted to check.

268
00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:23.370
Anthony Taylor: So so you would. I mean, if this was something we needed to know

269
00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:27.080
Anthony Taylor: this, would you would basically do this and this

270
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:29.809
Anthony Taylor: I mean, and look and see what the values are

271
00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:33.069
sonja baro: okay. Okay?

272
00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:46.940
sonja baro: And then how do you describe the other question we had, or at least I did in our group was, If you're explaining Iqr, like, what's a layman's way to describe? Iqr.

273
00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:51.250
Anthony Taylor: the the distance between the second quartile and the and the third

274
00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:53.050
sonja baro: right? So this

275
00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.049
Anthony Taylor: that's yeah. So if you figure

276
00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.449
Anthony Taylor: between 25% and 75% of the data

277
00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:02.749
sonja baro: perfect. How much data is in between? Yeah.

278
00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.300
sonja baro: okay, thank you.

279
00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:08.240
Anthony Taylor: No, not a problem. Any other questions.

280
00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.150
Anthony Taylor: Nay.

281
00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:13.340
Anthony Taylor: alright. So

282
00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:17.810
Anthony Taylor: I said, I'm like 99%, sure, we actually covered this one, too.

283
00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:29.690
Anthony Taylor: But we're gonna do it again as a review. So we're going to talk about Sem.  So this has a lot to do with like gathering

284
00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:34.110
Anthony Taylor: data and ensuring that multiple

285
00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.690
Anthony Taylor: populations or samples of our data

286
00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:50.770
Anthony Taylor: are representative of the original sample. Okay? So here, we're just gonna do some basic. So we're gonna mean or standard deviation. We're gonna create a histogram. Alright.

287
00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:53.600
Anthony Taylor: there's our histogram looks great.

288
00:26:54.040 --> 00:27:06.839
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna grab a specific range of data. We're gonna say, give me rows 766 through 856. So 90 rows of data and we're going to

289
00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.329
Anthony Taylor: make a histogram of it. Now, just looking at this.

290
00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.680
Anthony Taylor: we can see this data is pretty different.

291
00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:22.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay, our sample is probably not representative

292
00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:32.479
Anthony Taylor: of our data. And if you look here, it says, the the mean is 23.3 3, and the standard deviations 5.9 4. What we wanted is close to that as possible.

293
00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:37.069
Anthony Taylor: 18.4 8 and 2.4 one, not even close.

294
00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:39.090
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

295
00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:47.730
Anthony Taylor: So we can also say, just give me use the sample method and just give me 90 random records.

296
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:49.900
Anthony Taylor: And let's see how that comes up

297
00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:53.830
Anthony Taylor: much better.

298
00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:59.870
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And even visually, we can see much more simple.

299
00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:06.839
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So we did a much better job with getting a better representative sample of our data by using

300
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:11.150
Anthony Taylor: sample, which is just randomly selecting 90 rows of data.

301
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.380
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

302
00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:17.580
Anthony Taylor: Here we're going to sample 30 rows

303
00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:22.279
Anthony Taylor: and just print out the the Sem.

304
00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:30.259
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So let's look at what send is on here. Alright calculates the standard error of the mean

305
00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:34.360
Anthony Taylor: or a standard error measurement. The values input it right?

306
00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:40.020
Anthony Taylor: Basically, all this is going to do is tell us how close to the original

307
00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:46.080
Anthony Taylor: are we with this sample? So this sample with 30 was point 8 4.

308
00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:56.079
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so what we're looking for is as close to. I don't want to say it wrong one pretty sure.

309
00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:12.690
Anthony Taylor: But I don't want to say, Hello. so give me 1Â s statistics have to be populations. Jeremy. Function samples. It's there we go.  yes.

310
00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:20.470
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So yeah, we're looking for close to one. So this was pretty close notice. If we run this again. Aha! Change.

311
00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:25.399
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if we write it again, it's changed again. Why, we're using sample

312
00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:31.270
Anthony Taylor: sample is just randomly selected. Okay, but as long as that number stays close to one we're doing good.

313
00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:33.660
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So here

314
00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:37.029
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna do list comprehension. Yes, Meredith.

315
00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:52.469
Meredith McCanse (she/her): will you say I'm not fully wrapping my head around the set? The standard error of the mean. We used to say it one more time. I think you said it's the distance away from the mean. Is that so cool?

316
00:29:53.190 --> 00:30:00.170
Anthony Taylor: It gives us a good idea. The potential deviation of our sample mean from our population. So when you look at

317
00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:09.720
Anthony Taylor: this example, this mean is 1848. This is the original. This is our all of our data. And the mean was 23.3 3.

318
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:16.150
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So so we're not actually doing the 7. This one. This will probably be pretty pretty far

319
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:23.659
Anthony Taylor: while this one. The mean is like almost perfect right. This one would probably be like almost a what

320
00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:32.080
Meredith McCanse (she/her): and a one means. A one means it's exactly equal to it versus like a 0.

321
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:38.720
Anthony Taylor: Yes, I wanna make sure that before I say that again, because it doesn't say. And that's the way I remember it.

322
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:45.370
Anthony Taylor: Good SEN, yes, I.

323
00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:47.300
sonja baro: So

324
00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:53.400
sonja baro: wh. What is the purpose? Like? We're trying to find this value out.

325
00:30:53.790 --> 00:31:00.200
sonja baro: to do what to understand, what we need to modify, make sure our sample

326
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:06.250
Anthony Taylor: is is as close to the original as possible. So this isn't the same as like.

327
00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:09.659
Anthony Taylor: mean me, median and mode this is.

328
00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:24.390
Anthony Taylor: we want to know how good our sample is compared to our date. So our goal is, get a sample that represents our data. We're going to talk for about population

329
00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:31.590
sonja baro: similar to our data set. So whatever we're pulling as a sample looks similar to what the full data is.

330
00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.150
Anthony Taylor: Yes, exactly.

331
00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:36.100
sonja baro: Exactly.

332
00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:42.639
Anthony Taylor: That's so funny. I found like, like 500 different. You know what I'm gonna ask our friend.

333
00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:53.389
Anthony Taylor: This is probably the easiest way to do this, because we like looking at the. It's like looking at the composition of a rock

334
00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:58.120
Clayton Graves: to make sure it came from a certain mountain kind of

335
00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:59.849
Anthony Taylor: sort of yeah.

336
00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.080
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Here we go

337
00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:08.539
smaller. SIM indicates sample. Mean is more reliable.

338
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.600
Anthony Taylor: This is generally, yeah, okay. But we're getting ones.

339
00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:16.199
Anthony Taylor: Context matters. Consider confidence intervals.

340
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:22.980
Anthony Taylor: Ultimately, what constitutes a good score depends on the specific objectives or analysis. Okay, so

341
00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:31.850
Anthony Taylor: the one is putting us as close to that that mean as possible. So we should be good there, and this is going to make a little more sense. Let's dig a little deeper before we continue. So

342
00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.460
Anthony Taylor: here I'm going to grab 30

343
00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:42.309
Anthony Taylor: sample rows 10 times 10 different samples. 30 rows in each one.

344
00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:46.919
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna put it into a list called vehicle sample set.

345
00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:51.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Now, we're gonna get the means

346
00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:55.429
Anthony Taylor: of each of the samples

347
00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:59.900
Anthony Taylor: in vehicle sample. Set right here. Okay.

348
00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:04.960
Anthony Taylor: put that in the means. Our standard errors, we're going to say, give me the Sem.

349
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:16.060
Anthony Taylor: which is how we calculate it for the sample in each one of those items. And we're going to create an X-axis, which is basically

350
00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:21.999
Anthony Taylor: the length of our sample set. Okay? So we'll create that.

351
00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.030
Anthony Taylor: Now we're going to do a subplot where we're going to do

352
00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:29.250
Anthony Taylor: the we're going to pass this kind of error bar plot.

353
00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:31.469
Anthony Taylor: We're going to pass in our X-axis.

354
00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:34.849
Anthony Taylor: our averages and our send value.

355
00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:39.700
Anthony Taylor: Okay. and this Xlim y Lim. X. Take a Y label.

356
00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.770
Anthony Taylor: And it looks like this. Now.

357
00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:47.229
Anthony Taylor: all of us, that stuff put aside doesn't really matter what matters

358
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:50.410
Anthony Taylor: is which of these guys

359
00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:55.420
Anthony Taylor: are like we want the ones that are the closest, that are the most similar.

360
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:58.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And with the shortest whiskers.

361
00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:01.610
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

362
00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:06.249
Anthony Taylor: so that's how we tell is with the shortest whisker. So I would say, this is probably

363
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:09.070
Anthony Taylor: the best one. It's funny. In the last example.

364
00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:11.500
Anthony Taylor: We actually.

365
00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:19.650
Anthony Taylor: I remember when we did this last time, we actually had like a way to to show which one was the best.

366
00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.770
Anthony Taylor: There it is.

367
00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:29.839
Anthony Taylor: This might work.

368
00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:33.219
Anthony Taylor: I don't know why they didn't add this to this one

369
00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:46.280
Anthony Taylor: now. cause Sims isn't defined. Oh, we called it standard errors.

370
00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:50.100
Anthony Taylor: Maybe

371
00:34:55.239 --> 00:34:56.559
Anthony Taylor: there's still another one

372
00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:02.970
Anthony Taylor: there we go. So the smallest seminar was point 8 1.

373
00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:06.549
They got about.

374
00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:14.489
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so this is the distance of this is how long the whisker is. So the shorter you get that 0 the better.

375
00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:16.300
Anthony Taylor: But one is still pretty good.

376
00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:20.789
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but if we run this enough times you'll see it drop slower and lower.

377
00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:25.780
Anthony Taylor: which is what we're looking for. So in this case we got a point 8 1,

378
00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:34.170
Anthony Taylor: which is the seventh bar. Okay, so what we're looking for is close to 0 as possible, not one 0.

379
00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:37.380
Anthony Taylor: And the bigger the number, the less

380
00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.900
Anthony Taylor: representative it is. But

381
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:45.269
Anthony Taylor: again, a one isn't necessarily bad. It depends on your use case

382
00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:49.389
Anthony Taylor: if you can. So if you can tolerate that much. It's fine.

383
00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:53.220
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Alright.

384
00:35:53.390 --> 00:36:04.229
Anthony Taylor:  okay. We have a student activity with the same thing. This is definitely one

385
00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:09.099
Anthony Taylor: that I would have mine open next to it while you're doing it.

386
00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:18.469
Anthony Taylor: In fact, I'm gonna go through it real quick, just to make sure I ran all of these earlier. But I know there's one I'm not gonna think you guys do by yourself.

387
00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:20.230
Anthony Taylor: Don't think this is it.

388
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:23.670
Anthony Taylor: There's one that's just like I'm like.

389
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:34.649
Anthony Taylor: there's like 2 things we showed them and the rest you just expect them to know. Good sounds.

390
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.789
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So that last little thing I stuck on the end

391
00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:44.939
Anthony Taylor: to show the the the best one you're going to want to use that if they didn't give it to you. Let's see.

392
00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:53.690
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. See, this is that last little part I showed you at the end where I brought it in and pasted it.

393
00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:57.950
Anthony Taylor: You're going to want to bring that in to hear. Okay

394
00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:02.730
and make sure you change the variable. But for the most part.

395
00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:10.750
Anthony Taylor: think you guys will be okay. This is not an easy one, so don't get too upset if it's not crystal clear. Yes, I

396
00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:19.070
sonja baro: you said. Did you give us that last bit? Did you put it in line? Oh, you know what I didn't do that I just put it in line.

397
00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:25.860
sonja baro: Yeah. that's me. I'd be happy to pull it in. I

398
00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.710
Anthony Taylor: then we find it

399
00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:32.010
Anthony Taylor: there it is. Yeah.

400
00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:37.169
Anthony Taylor: I'm thinking about giving it to you with the proper variables, so that you don't have to change the variables.

401
00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:39.800
Anthony Taylor: Here you go

402
00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:46.560
Anthony Taylor: because I did not go because it wasn't included in the instructor. Demo. I just added it, that's all.

403
00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:49.919
And it helped, as it reminded me.

404
00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:51.550
Anthony Taylor: Alright. There we go!

405
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:53.380
sonja baro: Thank you

406
00:37:56.810 --> 00:38:02.140
Anthony Taylor: welcome back, everybody. Let's go through it.

407
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:04.829
Anthony Taylor: Oh, there we go!

408
00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:06.639
Clayton Graves: I'm rushed up.

409
00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:08.390
Anthony Taylor: Sorry.

410
00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:12.949
Clayton Graves: This is some rough stuff, not gonna lie. Well, it it.

411
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:26.409
Clayton Graves: I do get the concepts, though, about judging a subset of the original to see if it's a proper representative of the original that makes sense.

412
00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:33.800
Anthony Taylor: And and have we talked about samples and populations before

413
00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:44.260
Anthony Taylor: I know we talked about this, but did we get into my whole samples and population lecture? I don't think we did so. Let me just pause for quick second, and we'll come back to this.

414
00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:46.890
Anthony Taylor: Well, no, let's go through this, and then I'll do it.

415
00:38:46.990 --> 00:39:00.750
Anthony Taylor: So here we have. You know, we're pulling it in. This is one of those ones where it's a a pre-made dataset in sk learn. So we use sk learn data sets and pick the one we want

416
00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.860
Anthony Taylor: gives us a bunch of cool stuff.

417
00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:05.710
Anthony Taylor:  yeah.

418
00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:07.200
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

419
00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:18.460
Anthony Taylor: So it gave us this first little bit here and said, Hey, we want to use housing data. Me, Dv, as our data. Okay, here it is at the end.

420
00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:21.180
Anthony Taylor: Well, we created that. Oh.

421
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:26.869
Anthony Taylor: now I know why it wasn't. And I'm like, I don't understand why it wasn't in there. Okay, so

422
00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:36.069
Anthony Taylor: in these sk learn data sets. okay. these are actually designed for machine learning.

423
00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:40.739
Anthony Taylor: and they separate the data into features and targets.

424
00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:49.889
Anthony Taylor: All right. The Me. Dv. I don't know why it's sure it's listed. If we go deep enough in here. But the Me. Dv is the target.

425
00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:57.540
Anthony Taylor: That's the target of this particular data set. So you see here where

426
00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:06.800
Anthony Taylor: calling the target and we're assigning it to this, me Dv value. And that's where Medv comes from. That's why it's not listed here.

427
00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:10.879
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that'll make more sense in a couple weeks.

428
00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:15.909
Anthony Taylor: But it just it was there. You just didn't see it in this part of the description.

429
00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:24.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So once we have that we're going to say we're going to give 25 samples of 20 records. We're going to loop through. Output it

430
00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:26.380
Anthony Taylor: going to be exciting.

431
00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:36.279
Anthony Taylor: We're going to get the mean of each of those and the sem of the mean are of the sorry of the sem of that sample as well.

432
00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:41.510
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna do our subplots. The error bar. This is kind of

433
00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:47.220
Anthony Taylor: heavy. But basically, this is just how many samples. Okay.

434
00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.910
Anthony Taylor: we have our means. Yeah.

435
00:40:50.410 --> 00:41:02.419
Raugewitz, Tania: so just because and I hope this isn't too much. But can you just slow down in your running through what we did because we did it as a group without you? So not all of us are on the same page.

436
00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:04.180
Raugewitz, Tania: totally cool.

437
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:11.810
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So we'll go back to here. Is this fair back to? Okay? So this is our list comprehension.

438
00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:20.330
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And we're so we're doing our loop. And we're going for range 0 in number of samples. Because we said, we want 25 samples.

439
00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.559
Anthony Taylor: So this is going to loop 25 times

440
00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:29.769
Anthony Taylor: each time it's going to run the sample method on the data set

441
00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:40.130
Anthony Taylor: for and grab 20 records. See here. So this will be a list of

442
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:45.680
Anthony Taylor: 20 data outputs. Okay.

443
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:48.479
Anthony Taylor: of 25 records in each one.

444
00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:55.450
Anthony Taylor: So is that everybody comfortable with that? Wait. Okay, so here's oh, sorry! Go ahead, was it?

445
00:41:55.540 --> 00:42:01.909
Clayton Graves: It sounded like that was the reverse of what I'm comprehending here, because when I put this I see

446
00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.470
Clayton Graves: 25 samples of 20.

447
00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:06.509
sonja baro: I'm with Clayton.

448
00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:11.069
Anthony Taylor: Correct. Isn't that what I said? We're making 25 samples.

449
00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:25.170
Anthony Taylor: 20 records in each one. Okay, so

450
00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:29.049
Anthony Taylor: we're going to loop 25 times.

451
00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:32.860
Anthony Taylor: pulling 20 records each time

452
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:36.030
Anthony Taylor: into a list that will contain

453
00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:40.080
Anthony Taylor: 25 outputs of those 20 record.

454
00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:52.170
Anthony Taylor: Then we're going to loop through that list and get the mean of every data set that's in there. So all 25 of them.

455
00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:54.670
Anthony Taylor: we will have the mean of the average.

456
00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:57.040
Anthony Taylor: then the same thing.

457
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:59.779
Anthony Taylor: But we're going to calculate the Ccm

458
00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:04.090
Anthony Taylor: just a method just like meme, except for its sef

459
00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:11.320
Anthony Taylor: same exact values, same exact date. But we're gonna put those into separate lists. Everybody good. With that.

460
00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:20.920
Anthony Taylor: we're actually doing really good today. So I don't mind spending extra time so good. So this is probably the most complicated line of code in here.

461
00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:23.270
Anthony Taylor: So let's take it apart.

462
00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:29.310
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So first. well, first, we've got our figure, which is the canvas where our chart is going to live.

463
00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:39.710
Anthony Taylor: Our axes says we're gonna have one chart on this figure. and then we're gonna do Plt subplots. It draws the canvas

464
00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:41.340
Anthony Taylor: in the background.

465
00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:46.430
Anthony Taylor: Now, we're going to add an error bar to this axis.

466
00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:49.610
Anthony Taylor: which is the Sems chart.

467
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:55.769
Anthony Taylor: We're saying. And and again, this is so unnecessary.

468
00:43:55.860 --> 00:44:02.289
Anthony Taylor: But basically, what they're saying is, give me the length of this of of the samples list.

469
00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:06.089
Anthony Taylor: Okay, which we know is 25.

470
00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:13.269
Anthony Taylor: All right. So go 0 to 25, one at a time and add one.

471
00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:21.150
Anthony Taylor: We could have just said number of samples, plus one, or even better, just 26. But whatever.

472
00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:23.520
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So that's what this

473
00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:27.520
Anthony Taylor: 0 to length of samples plus one.

474
00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:30.530
Anthony Taylor: Then we're going to take those means we calculated.

475
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:34.900
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to take those Sims, we calculated

476
00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:40.970
Anthony Taylor: this little format. This is what ends up in the middle. If you want the circle or not.

477
00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:46.189
Anthony Taylor: Okay in that center point. color is just the color of the bar. So blue.

478
00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:50.129
Anthony Taylor: Alright, Alpha, we do this in case they overlap

479
00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:54.540
Anthony Taylor: label. This is just the label on the chart.

480
00:44:54.970 --> 00:45:08.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so X limit, just like before all this does is kind of squeeze the left and right together. So we're basically saying, Give me, you know, start at 0 and go to the. And this is so funny

481
00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:10.890
Anthony Taylor: the length of means plus one.

482
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:14.510
Anthony Taylor: Anybody. See why, that's kind of a silly thing to say.

483
00:45:15.850 --> 00:45:17.760
Anthony Taylor: What's the length of the means.

484
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:32.940
Anthony Taylor: Isn't it the same as the link of the samples? It's just like they're just like playing with it. Okay? So the length of the means is same as the link for the samples, which is the number of samples.

485
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:40.670
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we're doing 25 plus one  good programming technique

486
00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:43.749
Anthony Taylor: you would have if you really wanted to do it this way.

487
00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:54.079
Anthony Taylor: you would have simply created a variable at the top of this, and used that variable in both of these places. It's silly to code it twice, especially with entirely different

488
00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:58.320
Anthony Taylor: this, there's no point. It didn't add anything.

489
00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:10.780
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so our X label Y label. That's words that will be XY. Our legend, just like when we were doing our charts before our line charts. It's going to put it the best spot on the figure.

490
00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:16.350
Anthony Taylor: We're going to tell it to be font size. I don't actually know. I don't remember what fancy box does. So let's see.

491
00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:19.580
Anthony Taylor: Huh! It's a fancy box. I don't know why that's fancy.

492
00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:23.630
Anthony Taylor: but it is okay.

493
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:28.489
Anthony Taylor: I guess the cool thing about Alpha on this is you could kind of see through the dots a little bit

494
00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:35.459
Anthony Taylor: alright. But here you go. So this bar is the SEO. the.is the mean.

495
00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:47.699
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so boom, boom, boom, boom, boom! There you go. Okay, now. we can visually see this and go. This is probably the best one number 10.

496
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:50.379
Anthony Taylor: Okay, because it's the shortest.

497
00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:59.620
Anthony Taylor: So now we can print the range of sem values in sample set. So we're gonna take the Max Sdns

498
00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:03.690
Anthony Taylor: and the min. So remember, in fact, here, before we do that.

499
00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:07.970
Anthony Taylor: I'm just gonna print out test against.

500
00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:18.120
Anthony Taylor: And this is what that looks like. 25 values. These are the the what's making up the length of that bar? But we're saying, Give us the maximum and subtract the minimum.

501
00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:27.899
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So the range between these is 21 alright. The small. Oh, no, it's gonna give us the smallest.

502
00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:32.589
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to get the smallest. And then it's going to give us the index. So. In other words.

503
00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:42.049
Anthony Taylor: it's going to give us the smallest value in this list, and then the index of the smallest value which will effectively tell us which one of these bars is it?

504
00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:49.520
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we run this. The smallest value is 0 point 1 2. And yes, it was

505
00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:51.350
Anthony Taylor: sample 10.

506
00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:53.660
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

507
00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:04.819
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna print it all out at the end. So we're going to say, the mean of the sample 5. Is this the mean of the population data set.

508
00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:08.909
Anthony Taylor: Is this so? Not sure why they said.

509
00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:13.899
Anthony Taylor: this is wrong. So this word is wrong. And

510
00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:17.690
Anthony Taylor: it's like a changing thing. It's still the same. Right? Yeah.

511
00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:19.710
Anthony Taylor: okay.

512
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:24.060
Anthony Taylor: so is that fairly clear.

513
00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:33.789
Anthony Taylor: this is a really cool thing. And so now let's talk about population first. So I'm gonna get, I'm gonna get political for just a second. Oh, wait!

514
00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:36.060
Anthony Taylor: Mike has his hand up. He's gonna ruin it.

515
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:39.839
Anthony Taylor: What Mike.

516
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.300
michael mcpherson: can I say? The plot sample means with error bars absolutely

517
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:50.809
michael mcpherson: cause. I mine came up with no data. I need to see what I did.

518
00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:53.439
Anthony Taylor: He probably discoped it.

519
00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:59.319
Clayton Graves: Ours did that, too. For us. It was. The range was just way out of whack.

520
00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:06.200
Anthony Taylor: So the range that we put 26 right there, our 26 right there seems like 26,

521
00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:08.640
Anthony Taylor: and then you'll get the same thing.

522
00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:14.200
Anthony Taylor: Oh, and that didn't work. Why did that work? Oh, was it not 26? Hold up

523
00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:16.850
Dipinto, Matt: so range 26.

524
00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:19.020
Anthony Taylor: Oh, thank you.

525
00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:21.610
Anthony Taylor: So put 26 in here.

526
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:27.569
Dipinto, Matt: So that little snippet right there.

527
00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:34.210
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, that actually adds one to every value. And

528
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:39.030
Anthony Taylor: okay, so we still have to do arranging here, so you could do

529
00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:44.680
Anthony Taylor: 25. Okay.

530
00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:48.420
Anthony Taylor: alright. There you go, if that makes it easier for you.

531
00:49:51.350 --> 00:49:53.030
Anthony Taylor: and you do the same thing here.

532
00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:59.879
michael mcpherson: Still, no plot points, but I'll figure it out.

533
00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:03.680
michael mcpherson: Look at it. You want to look at it, Mike.

534
00:50:05.250 --> 00:50:09.250
Clayton Graves: Only take a second, Mike. Let's see yours, Buddy.

535
00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:11.940
Anthony Taylor: We're doing good, so don't worry about it.

536
00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:21.750
Anthony Taylor: So

537
00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:23.740
michael mcpherson: mine hates me

538
00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:29.370
Clayton Graves: your accent. Ylm is 20 to 28 that seems a little

539
00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:32.599
Clayton Graves: outside the scope. I think that's what we did, too.

540
00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:36.959
Dipinto, Matt: Yeah, just comment that line out. It'll auto-set it if you don't put it there at all.

541
00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:38.959
Anthony Taylor: There you go!

542
00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:45.149
michael mcpherson: Got it. Thank you. Y'all are smart.

543
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:51.440
michael mcpherson: good eye, both of you, Clayton and Matt on that good job.

544
00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:52.820
Anthony Taylor: Fine.

545
00:50:54.330 --> 00:51:06.049
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So let's talk about population versus sample. So I think maybe we did talk about this. Stop me if we did so. Back in 2,016

546
00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:14.299
Anthony Taylor: there was a whole lot of polls on election day

547
00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:17.040
Anthony Taylor: that said

548
00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:23.210
Anthony Taylor: we all knew who our next President was going right. Every one of them.

549
00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:26.930
Anthony Taylor: every single poll

550
00:51:27.850 --> 00:51:29.140
Anthony Taylor: said the same thing.

551
00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:31.550
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

552
00:51:31.830 --> 00:51:40.580
Anthony Taylor: So when we do data analysis. We, the reality is is we can't actually get every possible data point.

553
00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:50.499
Anthony Taylor: It's just not realistic. Alright, most of the time. It's not realistic. So we do a sample. Well. here's the problem.

554
00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:58.209
Anthony Taylor: the sample we don't even have to get into. Why the sample was so wrong, though there's a lot of discussion on that.

555
00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:12.800
Anthony Taylor: But the sample of the the polls that were taken back in that election overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly. did not match the actual demographic of the United States.

556
00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:18.139
Anthony Taylor: Okay. overwhelmingly did not match.

557
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:27.379
Anthony Taylor: And that is what went wrong. And now I mean and I'll tell you. Like every data gatherer, I mean everybody

558
00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:30.670
Anthony Taylor: to pause the next day.

559
00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:36.109
Anthony Taylor: and not because they cared who was President. They cared that every single one of them reported the wrong thing.

560
00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:46.380
Anthony Taylor: They didn't care. They don't care who wins or losers. I mean, maybe they do. But on paper, when we publish that stuff we don't care. We're publishing statistics.

561
00:52:47.110 --> 00:52:48.660
Anthony Taylor: This is what we think

562
00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:50.840
Anthony Taylor: confident

563
00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:59.559
Anthony Taylor: when your confidence level is really really high on paper and you publish it. And it's completely wrong. You're like.

564
00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:03.740
Anthony Taylor: I mean, people lost their jobs over there.

565
00:53:04.650 --> 00:53:07.979
Anthony Taylor: Okay, because the sample was wrong.

566
00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:10.659
Anthony Taylor: How could they have done a better job? Well.

567
00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:16.320
Anthony Taylor: I won't get into it too terribly much. I'll I'll throw out a couple of quick things. Okay?

568
00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:23.849
Anthony Taylor:  right? So they they're they're calling people.

569
00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:26.550
Anthony Taylor: And first off, how many of you.

570
00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:34.079
Anthony Taylor: when someone calls unsolicited and start saying, Hey, we're just curious. Who's gonna vote for

571
00:53:34.550 --> 00:53:41.829
Anthony Taylor: how many of you would say, Never mind anything. anybody. Okay, there's there's the first group of people.

572
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:43.889
Anthony Taylor: Okay, the second group of evil

573
00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:52.230
Anthony Taylor: you're voting for somebody who a lot of people aren't thinking is very popular right now, and you could be totally ostracizing your job

574
00:53:52.890 --> 00:54:00.960
Anthony Taylor: if someone found it out that you were going to vote for that person. Now, if that were true, and someone called you and said, hey? Who are you going to vote for?

575
00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:06.959
Anthony Taylor: Would anybody else change their mind? I'm not going to tell you, or just straight up. Lie about

576
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:09.419
Anthony Taylor: that happened, too.

577
00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:16.120
Anthony Taylor: So what we saw during that whole situation was that

578
00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:31.339
Anthony Taylor: one, the people who actually answer the phone and do those polls are very select, demographic, typically they're older, which you would think be more conservative. But a lot of the older Conservatives were scared to say anything

579
00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:33.510
Anthony Taylor: right there.

580
00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:35.430
Anthony Taylor: or they're activists.

581
00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:38.059
Anthony Taylor: And the activists overwhelmingly.

582
00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:46.089
Anthony Taylor: were leaning towards the democratic side. So, anyway, what we saw was this huge.

583
00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:48.570
Anthony Taylor: horribly

584
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:50.890
Anthony Taylor: skewed sample.

585
00:54:51.500 --> 00:55:00.969
Anthony Taylor: and if they could have done something like this. It would have made all the difference in the world, but they couldn't. Why? Because again, most of them weren't even telling the truth.

586
00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:04.779
Anthony Taylor: They didn't care. Nobody wanted to even admit.

587
00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:06.910
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

588
00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:11.489
Anthony Taylor: it's a funny. It's a funny, funny story to that.

589
00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:23.279
Anthony Taylor: People were going around and asking, Did you vote? Who did you vote for nobody. It's like if nobody you know, voted for that person out of the President. because some of them were life

590
00:55:23.690 --> 00:55:35.690
Clayton Graves: also kind of matters where you, Poll, too. Right? I mean, exactly. If you're polling in a in a in a red state, you're gonna get numbers that support a red candidate

591
00:55:36.090 --> 00:55:47.290
Anthony Taylor: absolutely, and doesn't even matter that it's that that one just stands out because the polls were so bad, like so wrong. I know that's a controversial one. But the polls were just crazy, wrong.

592
00:55:47.370 --> 00:55:59.870
Anthony Taylor: And and and it was, it's one of the best examples of where the sample just didn't match the population. And population isn't necessarily people. Population is your entire data set.

593
00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:03.420
Anthony Taylor: Okay, population could be measurements from a machine

594
00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:18.189
Anthony Taylor: all right, that you took a sample. If your sample doesn't even come close. Then, whatever you do with that sample is pretty much pointless. doesn't mean anything because it doesn't match the population.

595
00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:22.400
Anthony Taylor: It's just in this case. The population is the well, the actual population.

596
00:56:22.830 --> 00:56:33.580
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So anyway. that's my favorite like, it's it's, I know it's makes some people wiggle. But for the most part. it's

597
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:38.059
Anthony Taylor: It was just a great example of statistics gone wrong.

598
00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:40.600
Anthony Taylor: So yeah, Meredith

599
00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:45.710
Meredith McCanse (she/her): got me before I even hit the handout thing.

600
00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:48.840
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I have a question. Can you go back to the

601
00:56:49.210 --> 00:56:58.950
Meredith McCanse (she/her): the code you had on your screen a second ago? Can you talk through? Down, yeah, down towards the bottom where you're setting the index for the standard errors.

602
00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:03.349
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Oh, this one we're not setting it. We're simply asking for.

603
00:57:04.810 --> 00:57:12.390
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Can you explain? Will you say that again, what's happened? I don't understand how this made it. Say that you told us which sample was the minimum

604
00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:15.890
Anthony Taylor: perfect. Okay, so keep in mind.

605
00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:18.329
Anthony Taylor: Sims, in this case is just a list.

606
00:57:18.350 --> 00:57:19.550
Meredith McCanse (she/her): right? It's

607
00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:22.449
Anthony Taylor: where'd my list go that I had up on the screen

608
00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:26.430
Anthony Taylor: where they go? I guess I deleted it.

609
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:29.340
Anthony Taylor:  I'll put it back up there.

610
00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:31.380
Anthony Taylor: So

611
00:57:32.930 --> 00:57:34.450
Anthony Taylor: this is Samps.

612
00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:40.909
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so this is what that method calculated for each sample that we were going through.

613
00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:44.920
Anthony Taylor: Okay. the lowest one of these is the winner.

614
00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:53.029
Anthony Taylor: These bars are in order of this list, so whatever the lowest one is in here which we happen to know is this one.

615
00:57:53.250 --> 00:57:54.190
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

616
00:57:54.410 --> 00:58:01.569
Anthony Taylor: whatever it's indexes. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

617
00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:04.620
Anthony Taylor: Okay, whatever that index is

618
00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:08.879
Anthony Taylor: is which bar we're gonna see?

619
00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:19.980
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Which bar, we can say is the right sample. So if you were really, if we were really taking this to the next step, and we said, Hey, we want to use the best sample.

620
00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:23.330
Anthony Taylor: You would actually only go use

621
00:58:24.510 --> 00:58:27.100
Anthony Taylor: Thames bracket 9

622
00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:32.030
Anthony Taylor: to get the best sample, and then you would use that to do your analysis?

623
00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:34.090
Anthony Taylor: Does that make sense?

624
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:38.170
Meredith McCanse (she/her): As we're looking for the closest to the original?

625
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:42.140
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So in that code, you're not setting an index.

626
00:58:42.170 --> 00:58:49.189
Meredith McCanse (she/her): you're telling me. Give me the index number of the one that's the minimum

627
00:58:50.290 --> 00:58:53.079
Anthony Taylor: perfect. That is exactly right.

628
00:58:53.390 --> 00:59:00.699
Anthony Taylor: So we just needed the index number because these are in order of that list, and that'll tell us which one of these is the lowest.

629
00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:01.990
Okay.

630
00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:03.290
Meredith McCanse (she/her): thank you.

631
00:59:03.790 --> 00:59:05.280
Anthony Taylor: Yep, yep, yep.

632
00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:09.110
Anthony Taylor: I love that. You guys are into that. Okay.

633
00:59:10.170 --> 00:59:15.009
Anthony Taylor: that's it. So let's do break. See? You guys, 8, 25 have a good break.

634
00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:23.099
Anthony Taylor: most likely, unless I get one before then, which is pretty unlikely. All right.

635
00:59:25.290 --> 00:59:31.220
Anthony Taylor: so the reason I was looking what made me think about X class was, we're starting

636
00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:35.469
Anthony Taylor: some predictive analytics next class, like, really start.

637
00:59:35.710 --> 00:59:36.510
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

638
00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:39.440
Anthony Taylor: today, we're gonna peak

639
00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:41.800
Anthony Taylor: at it. But we're gonna cover.

640
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:47.520
Anthony Taylor: possibly one of the most important topics when starting. Ml.

641
00:59:47.830 --> 00:59:49.490
Anthony Taylor: and that's correlation.

642
00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:51.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

643
00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:57.809
Anthony Taylor:  so what does correlation mean? Well, it basically means

644
00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:01.770
Anthony Taylor: one value is how one value affects another.

645
01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:05.860
Anthony Taylor: Basically, that's it. Okay.

646
01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:11.170
Anthony Taylor: so a positive correlation when the X axes is going up.

647
01:00:11.290 --> 01:00:13.269
Anthony Taylor: The Y axis is going up

648
01:00:13.290 --> 01:00:20.780
Anthony Taylor: perfect correlation. That means they're going up at exactly the same rate which would give you this near perfect.

649
01:00:20.890 --> 01:00:22.840
Anthony Taylor: 45 degree angle.

650
01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:27.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Assuming you had a 90 degree box. Okay.

651
01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.000
Anthony Taylor: positive correlation.

652
01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:38.360
Anthony Taylor: negative correlation is exactly the opposite. As X goes up, Y comes down.

653
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:46.099
Anthony Taylor: But if they're doing it at exactly the same rate, it is a perfect negative correlation.

654
01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:49.210
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

655
01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:57.460
Anthony Taylor: no. Correlation basically means that no matter what X is doing y is doing its own thing

656
01:00:59.770 --> 01:01:01.079
Anthony Taylor: pretty much. That's it.

657
01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:03.330
Anthony Taylor: Now.

658
01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:09.310
Anthony Taylor: these are all our qualitative ways of seeing this.

659
01:01:09.730 --> 01:01:22.530
Anthony Taylor: I can guarantee you in correlations qualitative is not usually very successful. You'll get it right some of the time. But the reality is, we really, really, really

660
01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:28.789
Anthony Taylor: what a quantitative way come up with. So we have

661
01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:34.030
Anthony Taylor: pool function. Pearson's correlation coefficient.

662
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.689
Anthony Taylor: Okay? You should know this word.

663
01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:40.399
Anthony Taylor: these 3 words

664
01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:47.149
Anthony Taylor: alright. It's a quantitative measure that describes the variability of 2

665
01:01:47.410 --> 01:01:48.510
Anthony Taylor: variables.

666
01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:55.610
Anthony Taylor:  if the value is from 0 to negative one.

667
01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.359
Anthony Taylor: it is a negative correlation.

668
01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:04.200
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this is a negative one. Correlation.

669
01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:11.419
Anthony Taylor: Alright. if it's 0. No correlation at all.

670
01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:18.180
Anthony Taylor: The closer to positive one is this correlation

671
01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:20.429
Anthony Taylor: perfectly correlated?

672
01:02:20.850 --> 01:02:26.929
Anthony Taylor: Now, the reality is, most of your values are, gonna be like less than one, or.

673
01:02:28.110 --> 01:02:34.850
Anthony Taylor: you know, almost to one, or almost a negative one. the closer to 0 it is, the less correlated. It is.

674
01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:51.089
Anthony Taylor: What you're looking for is like the 80 s. 90 s. Right in there. Okay.  do they have it? There's actually a chart, and if I can't find it, I'll go find it for you.

675
01:02:51.610 --> 01:03:02.230
Anthony Taylor:  that talks about, you know. Mostly mostly correlated, nearly correlated, not correlated at all.

676
01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:03.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

677
01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:11.790
Anthony Taylor: so. But the bottom line is the closer to the outer number, negative one or one, the more correlated the value

678
01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:18.590
Anthony Taylor: as it starts to get to the center, the less correlated. What we want to identify

679
01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:29.040
Anthony Taylor: is correlation between variables in our data. Now, we're not going to worry, too. Today, we're just going to look at how to calculate peers. Pearson's correlation coefficient.

680
01:03:29.050 --> 01:03:32.710
Anthony Taylor: But as we start really doing these predictive analytics.

681
01:03:33.050 --> 01:03:39.229
Anthony Taylor: it's going to be important to us to understand what you're causing this thrive.

682
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:52.310
Anthony Taylor: Now, we're gonna build machine learning algorithms that do that mostly calculate that for us and use that information. But if we can tell 2 variables don't correlate at all.

683
01:03:52.830 --> 01:04:01.500
Anthony Taylor: we don't need to add them to that algorithm. They don't benefit the algorithm at all. So we can make our machine learning algorithm simpler.

684
01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:08.800
Anthony Taylor: which means it uses less compute, which means it trains faster, which means it costs us less

685
01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:09.890
Anthony Taylor: money.

686
01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:17.460
Anthony Taylor: Alright, all very, very important. So correlation kind of a big deal.

687
01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:18.690
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

688
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:24.109
Anthony Taylor: alright. So let's go and look at how

689
01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:28.310
Anthony Taylor: we calculate correlation.

690
01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:43.709
Anthony Taylor: drag it. So we're gonna bring in our plot and our stats and our Pd. we're going to take a look, get rid of the null values. And we have this interesting date.

691
01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:49.910
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Pretty exciting.  so

692
01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:53.429
Anthony Taylor: we're going. For the first example, we're just going to grab

693
01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:58.430
Anthony Taylor: 2 columns. Alright, we're grabbing

694
01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:01.600
Anthony Taylor: adjusted net national income per capita.

695
01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:06.679
Anthony Taylor: And we're grabbing average alcohol consumption. So this

696
01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:13.029
Anthony Taylor: okay. and we're going to plot them out. And that's what they look like.

697
01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:15.849
Anthony Taylor: Is there a correlation there?

698
01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:18.080
Anthony Taylor: What do you guys think?

699
01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:23.770
Anthony Taylor: Maybe maybe not. I would say a slide correlation, but very sly.

700
01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:25.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

701
01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:35.230
Anthony Taylor: so here we're gonna look at the third, which is populations, Median age and cell phones per 100 people. What? Yeah.

702
01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:37.660
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

703
01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:41.710
Anthony Taylor: Correlation. No correlation.

704
01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:54.410
Anthony Taylor: I'm saying, I see. I mean, if you drew a line through the center of all this. it would almost certainly go up. So I'm thinking there might actually be one which is interesting

705
01:05:54.430 --> 01:06:05.140
Anthony Taylor: median age and cell phones. Biography. Okay. alright. Next one population with access to clean water and male life expectancy.

706
01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:10.710
Anthony Taylor: definite. Come on now.

707
01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:13.589
Anthony Taylor: Tandy's like no, but look.

708
01:06:13.830 --> 01:06:15.289
Anthony Taylor: and almost for sure

709
01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:20.490
Anthony Taylor: I don't know how close it's definitely not a one, but it's it's on its way

710
01:06:21.050 --> 01:06:24.330
Anthony Taylor: income per per capita versus

711
01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:26.850
Anthony Taylor: percent needle immunization.

712
01:06:31.930 --> 01:06:33.650
Anthony Taylor: That's a no, almost for sure.

713
01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:38.820
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I mean, maybe a little one, but not much.

714
01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:40.870
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So

715
01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:46.320
Anthony Taylor: all of those we did not calculate. The Pearson's coefficient. Okay.

716
01:06:46.530 --> 01:06:50.830
Anthony Taylor: so now let's do that. So here the same exact

717
01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:57.720
Anthony Taylor: chart we did up above. But we're going to add ST.

718
01:06:57.830 --> 01:07:03.790
Anthony Taylor: Dot Pearson, r, and then just put the values, the X and the Y in

719
01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:09.279
Anthony Taylor: there, and then we're going to print out the correlation. Alright. So let's see what that first one was

720
01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:13.350
Anthony Taylor: point 4 2. So this guy went up here

721
01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:14.670
Anthony Taylor: point 4 2.

722
01:07:17.290 --> 01:07:30.500
Anthony Taylor: It's not 0. It's halfway between 0 and one. Hi, that's a slight correlation. very slight. Okay. let's look at the next one income and alcohol.

723
01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:31.630
Anthony Taylor: Oh, wait!

724
01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:34.080
Anthony Taylor: Is that the same one?

725
01:07:34.730 --> 01:07:43.090
Anthony Taylor: Oh, sorry we're gonna plot it. Okay. So we're gonna see the plot again, so you can see it again. So here you can see the correlation. And then the plot, all right.

726
01:07:44.490 --> 01:07:49.010
Anthony Taylor: So here we're going to do the Median age and cell phones again. We're

727
01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:54.279
Anthony Taylor: throwing them in there doing the correlation. We're gonna print out the correlation with the plot

728
01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:56.280
Anthony Taylor: point 5 3.

729
01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:01.440
Anthony Taylor: The weird part is is that's only slightly better than this.

730
01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:04.720
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

731
01:08:05.450 --> 01:08:09.520
Anthony Taylor:  clean water, male life expectancy.

732
01:08:09.610 --> 01:08:10.810
Anthony Taylor: Oh, boy.

733
01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:14.769
Anthony Taylor: that is a very strong correlation.

734
01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:24.259
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we would be able to say without question that these things have a correlation, and they should be considered.

735
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:26.769
Anthony Taylor: If we're trying to predict something

736
01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:29.290
Anthony Taylor: like male life expectancy.

737
01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:33.190
Anthony Taylor: And this would be a value we would want to try to include.

738
01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:37.049
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, I will tell you another quick note.

739
01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:43.440
Anthony Taylor: Sometimes a perfect correlation is means the means we don't want to include.

740
01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:46.789
Anthony Taylor: Why do you think that is

741
01:08:49.229 --> 01:08:50.779
Jennifer Dahlgren: multicolinarity?

742
01:08:52.490 --> 01:09:04.879
Anthony Taylor: Jenna forgot the good good stuff, man. She's got the good stuff, basically, in layman's terms. right? One in one. If they're exactly the same, they don't add anything to the calculation.

743
01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:14.879
Anthony Taylor: right. They don't add anything. So when you try to put it in a machine learning algorithm, if they're exactly one to one who cares, just drop one, get rid of it. Don't need it.

744
01:09:15.490 --> 01:09:18.340
Anthony Taylor: Doesn't tell me any. Okay.

745
01:09:18.710 --> 01:09:22.080
Anthony Taylor: alright, we'll get more into that when we get heavier into machine learning

746
01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:24.919
Anthony Taylor: income versus measles.

747
01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:30.630
Anthony Taylor: Yeah point 3 4. I mean, that's that's so light. It wouldn't be worth worrying about.

748
01:09:31.439 --> 01:09:32.850
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And then that's it.

749
01:09:33.779 --> 01:09:36.069
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So all we learned there.

750
01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:42.310
Anthony Taylor: because we've done scatter plots with 2 variables many, many times. All we've added

751
01:09:43.149 --> 01:09:45.350
Anthony Taylor: is this correlation?

752
01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:47.220
Anthony Taylor: That's it.

753
01:09:48.569 --> 01:09:54.700
Anthony Taylor: ST. Pears Snar. put your data into it. That's it.

754
01:09:57.150 --> 01:09:58.120
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

755
01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:00.980
Anthony Taylor: Questions.

756
01:10:05.190 --> 01:10:08.050
Derek Rikke: Correlation is a topple

757
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:11.520
Anthony Taylor: well.

758
01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:16.169
Anthony Taylor: it doesn't need to be. No, it's really a float. But

759
01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:24.030
Anthony Taylor:  I see. Oh, I see what you see, you know what? Let's take a look. See? Let's see.

760
01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:25.329
Anthony Taylor: that's a good question.

761
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:27.630
Anthony Taylor: The output

762
01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:31.750
Anthony Taylor: of that one was, Oh, yeah, because it puts in the p-value as well.

763
01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:34.360
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

764
01:10:35.050 --> 01:10:39.370
Anthony Taylor: so yeah, the p-value don't worry about for this one. It does not

765
01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:43.609
Anthony Taylor: affect what we're doing. So yeah, we're only looking for the statistic.

766
01:10:45.390 --> 01:10:54.859
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Is that why, when you tell it to print the correlation in square brackets, you have 0 because the index of it because it's the first.

767
01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:58.130
Anthony Taylor: Yes, ma'am. 100%

768
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:06.930
Anthony Taylor: good call. Derek. I like that one the good question.

769
01:11:07.230 --> 01:11:21.330
Anthony Taylor: Any other questions about Pearson's correlation?  I'm

770
01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:25.219
Anthony Taylor: looking for something. Don't look for a second.

771
01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:32.620
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I'll show you guys in the solution. Yeah.

772
01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:35.810
Anthony Taylor: I think.

773
01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:58.989
Anthony Taylor: yeah. The only thing you don't worry about the bonus unless you want to do the bonus. But it's not necessary. Okay, so here, you're gonna load some wine data. And you're going to basically just do the same thing we did over there, just with Flint, with the columns that they suggest.

774
01:11:59.190 --> 01:12:02.769
Anthony Taylor: Okay, except this one, you could do the correlation in the next one

775
01:12:04.010 --> 01:12:06.520
Anthony Taylor: color intensity versus alcohol.

776
01:12:07.170 --> 01:12:13.420
Anthony Taylor: and if you want you could try this, I'm going to show you a better way to do it, though, that they don't teach you.

777
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:15.360
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

778
01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:18.189
Anthony Taylor: alright. So 10Â min

779
01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:21.410
Anthony Taylor: for this one. not 15.

780
01:12:21.710 --> 01:12:26.050
Anthony Taylor: It's really. It's very, very similar to the instructor one. So

781
01:12:28.290 --> 01:12:31.060
Anthony Taylor: welcome back. How'd you guys do

782
01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.469
Anthony Taylor: everybody get to the bonus.

783
01:12:35.070 --> 01:12:39.770
Clayton Graves: started talking about it. But we didn't actually get through it.

784
01:12:40.090 --> 01:12:42.730
Anthony Taylor: That's alright. I'm gonna show you a better way. And

785
01:12:43.690 --> 01:12:44.600
Anthony Taylor: 5.

786
01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:54.000
Anthony Taylor: So first same import, says before, okay. we're going to bring in this wine data set

787
01:12:54.060 --> 01:13:08.109
Anthony Taylor: and the little description I know they gave you all of this. but this is pretty cool. It's a fun data set. Boo! Hoo! First one said. Plot flavonoids versus malic acids. So here

788
01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:11.280
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna do just like we did in the instructor one.

789
01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:14.500
Anthony Taylor: We're going to take this column, put it in a variable.

790
01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:17.780
Anthony Taylor: Take this column. put it in a variable

791
01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:22.259
Anthony Taylor: going to create a scatter plot, simply plot, scatter.

792
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:24.560
Anthony Taylor: and then each variable.

793
01:13:25.170 --> 01:13:28.309
Anthony Taylor: We can throw labels on there if you want, and show it

794
01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:30.540
Anthony Taylor: alright

795
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:46.080
Anthony Taylor: to get the correlation. All we have to do. ST. Pearson, R. Passing those 2 variables in this case, they're printing it out. So they're also routing it and getting just the first value.

796
01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:49.200
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Which was the statistic.

797
01:13:50.290 --> 01:13:54.820
Anthony Taylor: So we can run that we can see negative 41.

798
01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:59.209
Anthony Taylor: Which means there is a somewhat negative correlation.

799
01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:01.950
Anthony Taylor: Alright, not great.

800
01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:09.080
Clayton Graves: Is it just me or the the coefficient way more useful than the the scatterplot.

801
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:21.350
Anthony Taylor: Oh, I think well, that's what I said before. I analyzing scatterplots are rarely, rarely, rarely, I mean, unless they're obvious. Are you successful? But

802
01:14:22.150 --> 01:14:25.739
Anthony Taylor: I mean, like point 4 one. Yeah.

803
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:33.339
Anthony Taylor: it's not very correlated, but it might be enough to add some value to a machine learning model that has a lot of variables in it.

804
01:14:33.810 --> 01:14:34.880
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

805
01:14:34.890 --> 01:14:39.170
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, I wouldn't throw it out for a negative point 4 1

806
01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:49.040
Anthony Taylor: alright. So the next one was color intensity versus alcohol guys. You could have almost used the same exact lines of code and just change those 2 routes.

807
01:14:50.770 --> 01:14:53.769
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So you're a full column for color intensity

808
01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:57.530
Anthony Taylor: column for alcohol, scatter, label, show

809
01:15:01.410 --> 01:15:02.820
Anthony Taylor: everybody good with that.

810
01:15:04.410 --> 01:15:05.230
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

811
01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:12.210
Anthony Taylor: And then for the correlation, same function is up above, you're passing alcoholic color intensity.

812
01:15:12.890 --> 01:15:16.820
Anthony Taylor: And here we got a point 5 5. So. yeah.

813
01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:23.470
Anthony Taylor: pretty much a correlation. Not huge, but not terrible.

814
01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:25.510
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

815
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:29.919
Anthony Taylor: okay, to do the correlation matrix

816
01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:32.520
Anthony Taylor: that they are suggesting.

817
01:15:32.970 --> 01:15:35.550
Anthony Taylor: You can use just dot 4.

818
01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:37.929
Anthony Taylor: So data frame dot.

819
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:48.400
Anthony Taylor: then you have to unstack and sort it alright, and it looks like this. So malic acid, you

820
01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:51.249
Anthony Taylor: point or negative point 5 6 correlation

821
01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:58.020
Anthony Taylor: Q. Malic acid, negative oil force, non-flavanoid phenols with flavonoids

822
01:15:58.060 --> 01:15:59.270
Anthony Taylor: point 5 3.

823
01:16:00.330 --> 01:16:01.539
Anthony Taylor: So this is fine.

824
01:16:01.670 --> 01:16:06.940
Anthony Taylor: Now let me show you the way I do it, and I do do this at work every once in a while

825
01:16:07.290 --> 01:16:18.050
Anthony Taylor: I bring in a library you haven't heard of yet, or some of you have. I know you've mentioned it. Seaborn Seaborn is another like Map plot. Live library.

826
01:16:18.290 --> 01:16:19.180
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

827
01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:23.269
Anthony Taylor: And we do wine data. Same wine data is up here.

828
01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:28.950
Anthony Taylor: dot core round 2. And that creates this matrix. Right here.

829
01:16:29.230 --> 01:16:32.799
Anthony Taylor: Then we say, heat map with that matrix.

830
01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:35.619
Anthony Taylor: And this is what you get.

831
01:16:39.130 --> 01:16:45.740
Anthony Taylor: So now the lighter the square, the the closer to one.

832
01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:48.669
Anthony Taylor: The correlation is all right.

833
01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:52.930
Anthony Taylor: So with this we can come in here, and we can very quickly see

834
01:16:53.330 --> 01:17:00.780
Anthony Taylor: that we have.  so correlations. The darker it is, the more negative.

835
01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:06.380
Anthony Taylor: so like the the dark black ones. and then you have the lighter ones.

836
01:17:07.530 --> 01:17:09.250
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Which

837
01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:14.719
Anthony Taylor: I mean, point 7 is fairly correlated. Okay, so the Flavonoids and the

838
01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:27.680
Anthony Taylor: Od 2800. D. 3, 15 of diluted wines. definitely total phenols definite a correlation in the blacks. We don't have a lot of negative.

839
01:17:27.870 --> 01:17:30.160
Anthony Taylor: and you can make this bigger, of course.

840
01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:39.299
Anthony Taylor:  but you guys see why this would be valuable to you, because I'm done all that stuff we did up above. I could just do this and see everything I need to see.

841
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:47.210
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Can you scroll up a little and just show that code? One more time? Sure, absolutely. I'll put it in slack as it's well.

842
01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:50.270
Anthony Taylor: it'll be in the solutions that I give you guys today.

843
01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:54.740
Anthony Taylor: But it's not in the official solution. So

844
01:17:55.520 --> 01:18:02.709
Meredith McCanse (she/her): and I had a quick question about the unstack to. Is that what does that do? Is that something we've done before?

845
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:06.540
Anthony Taylor: No. So basically, if we just look at

846
01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:09.280
Anthony Taylor: wine core.

847
01:18:13.410 --> 01:18:22.010
Anthony Taylor: You see how it looks like this. So it has alcohol. And then each one of these, which to me, I think this is easier to read than this.

848
01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:26.259
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but unstack is basically

849
01:18:26.370 --> 01:18:28.230
Anthony Taylor: going to pivot

850
01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:34.509
Anthony Taylor: the data frame so that there you have column column instead of column column.

851
01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:36.290
Anthony Taylor: Make sense.

852
01:18:36.330 --> 01:18:41.690
Anthony Taylor: See how it's alcohol, malic acid. Well, it's fine malic acid, malic acid

853
01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:44.309
Anthony Taylor: and hue.

854
01:18:46.890 --> 01:18:49.170
Anthony Taylor: See? It's right there.

855
01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:58.199
Anthony Taylor: And so it does. It's it does. It's thing that doesn't seem like, does it? Oh, I was looking at the wrong one. There we go, malic acid and hue.

856
01:18:58.530 --> 01:19:04.070
Anthony Taylor: So all it did was flatten. It was pivoting so that you could have these pairs like this.

857
01:19:04.670 --> 01:19:09.140
Anthony Taylor: But I personally think this is easier to read. And I definitely think this is easier.

858
01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:14.440
Anthony Taylor: Okay, thank you. So it's up to you, if you like this, this method or not.

859
01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:16.530
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

860
01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:26.070
Gebrekristos, Hafton: not not a question. But when you go up to your Scotto play.

861
01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:30.049
Gebrekristos, Hafton: Yeah. So when you

862
01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:42.520
Gebrekristos, Hafton: do, you have any reason why you create a variables instead of, you know, putting those column names because we're gonna have to. But since we're gonna use them twice, so we use them here

863
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:45.909
Anthony Taylor: and we use them here. Okay.

864
01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:53.350
Anthony Taylor: right and then and and then, you know, and you've heard me say before, you're gonna use something twice, make it a variable or a function.

865
01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:56.650
Anthony Taylor: Alright, I mean, did we have to? No, we didn't have to.

866
01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:58.879
Anthony Taylor: This is a preference.

867
01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:01.329
Anthony Taylor: Good question. Thank you. Heather

868
01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:05.080
Anthony Taylor: any other questions.

869
01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:10.780
Anthony Taylor: La! Oh, go ahead!

870
01:20:11.150 --> 01:20:16.050
michael mcpherson: So in in the challenges and homework, when we're doing this

871
01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:19.179
michael mcpherson: instead of doing all the term, added Pods.

872
01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:22.740
Anthony Taylor: Can we just skip to the seaboard?

873
01:20:23.530 --> 01:20:24.330
Anthony Taylor: Huh!

874
01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:27.120
Anthony Taylor: Seaborn is pretty cool.

875
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:34.040
Anthony Taylor: I don't think you have any scatterplot homework for the rest of this course. Okay, pretty sure.

876
01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:40.139
Anthony Taylor: Pretty sure. But you can't do it in in. Well, no, there is no data visualization homework. So

877
01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:42.560
Anthony Taylor: so yeah, feel free to do it.

878
01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:45.289
michael mcpherson: Can we use it in the projects?

879
01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:49.690
Anthony Taylor: Yes, of course, you can use anything in the projects more or less.

880
01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:54.580
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Alright. thank you. Here we go. No pro

881
01:20:56.390 --> 01:21:03.540
Anthony Taylor: sorry gang. So now we're going to do our first linear regression prediction.

882
01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:05.920
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's lame.

883
01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:16.479
Anthony Taylor: But we're gonna do it alright. So first we're going to import what we need. The only thing we're importing new in this is this, Sci-fi stats, Lynn regress.

884
01:21:17.690 --> 01:21:28.810
Anthony Taylor:  then we're going to get our data set. We're using the California housing one. We're getting the everything in this, including the target.

885
01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:30.719
Anthony Taylor: So we have all of that.

886
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:39.859
Anthony Taylor: Now we're gonna filter to remove some outliers. Now we didn't go through how they got the outliers. but we went, I mean

887
01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:44.400
Anthony Taylor: houses with more than 10 rooms were going to say, are outlier.

888
01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.130
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

889
01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:56.559
Anthony Taylor: Then we're going to reduce it to just San Diego. How do we do them? Well, latitude, longitude, or the boundaries of San Diego, and they say

890
01:21:57.390 --> 01:22:02.669
Anthony Taylor: latitude's greater than this, and less than this, the longitudes greater than this and less than it.

891
01:22:03.730 --> 01:22:06.440
Anthony Taylor: and apparently city, wasn't an option

892
01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:08.799
Anthony Taylor: how we run that.

893
01:22:09.050 --> 01:22:12.409
Anthony Taylor: So now we're going to plot

894
01:22:13.630 --> 01:22:15.550
Anthony Taylor: average rooms and

895
01:22:16.050 --> 01:22:20.389
Anthony Taylor: the target value. Okay? Which is the median value

896
01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:21.780
Anthony Taylor: alright

897
01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:32.790
Anthony Taylor: visually. That looks like a definite correlation which think about it. Rooms in the house and the price of the house. Yep.

898
01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:37.560
Anthony Taylor: that makes sense. Okay. So

899
01:22:39.450 --> 01:22:41.619
Anthony Taylor: this code is complicated.

900
01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:47.330
Anthony Taylor: but it's always the same.

901
01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:51.830
Anthony Taylor: Only need it one time.

902
01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:53.830
Anthony Taylor: and you can copy it anywhere.

903
01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:55.980
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

904
01:22:56.250 --> 01:23:02.070
Anthony Taylor: So X values and Y values. Well, we already talked about our, we know what that is. That's X and y.

905
01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:04.829
Anthony Taylor: okay, so that one's not a problem.

906
01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:13.630
Anthony Taylor: Lin regress does this variable unpacking at a very huge way.

907
01:23:14.670 --> 01:23:15.720
Anthony Taylor: So

908
01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:21.190
Anthony Taylor: remember the slope of the line. Actually, you know what? There's a slide for this. Hold up!

909
01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:24.930
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Friends of Iran.

910
01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:27.610
Anthony Taylor: what was that?

911
01:23:28.230 --> 01:23:32.569
michael mcpherson: Rise over, run y equals x plus B.

912
01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:36.149
Anthony Taylor: There it is. Okay. So

913
01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:40.280
Anthony Taylor: to get this, we need the X and the Y alright.

914
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:48.609
Anthony Taylor: and if we can make it work. It'd be great if we had either the sorry, the white intercept if we add this slope.

915
01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:54.720
Anthony Taylor:  of of the values as well. Okay. So oops.

916
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:59.949
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So when it comes to variables and equation refer to X. The equation is independent. Y is dependent.

917
01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:09.010
Anthony Taylor: The slope of the line is m, the y-intercept is B. So if we have this information, we can predict Y,

918
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:10.709
Anthony Taylor: does that make sense?

919
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:19.320
Anthony Taylor: If I know the slope of the line? My X-value is what was given. and my y-intercept

920
01:24:19.450 --> 01:24:22.050
Anthony Taylor: I can predict the value. Y,

921
01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:28.520
Meredith McCanse (she/her): but the slope itself is rise over. So it tells you how much to go up and how much to go over.

922
01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:31.559
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Rise over, rise over, run.

923
01:24:31.570 --> 01:24:34.550
Anthony Taylor: Well, it's it's well, you'll see in a sec.

924
01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:47.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So the slope of the lines noted in in, you know, for the YI think it's easier to show this. Oh, okay. So the slope of the line

925
01:24:47.210 --> 01:24:48.270
Anthony Taylor: is

926
01:24:48.670 --> 01:24:51.379
Anthony Taylor: a, do they have a picture of the slope

927
01:24:52.970 --> 01:24:54.070
Anthony Taylor: come on.

928
01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:58.830
Anthony Taylor: They used to have a picture of the slope. Okay, the slope of the line is basically how it's going

929
01:24:59.270 --> 01:25:01.770
Anthony Taylor: or down. Okay.

930
01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:05.420
Anthony Taylor: the y-intercept is where this line.

931
01:25:05.530 --> 01:25:07.660
Anthony Taylor: based on its slope.

932
01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:11.239
Anthony Taylor: will cross the Y axis.

933
01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:15.290
Anthony Taylor: So in this case it's going down. probably 0.

934
01:25:15.770 --> 01:25:18.260
Anthony Taylor: Why? Because it's correlated. 1 1.

935
01:25:19.550 --> 01:25:21.039
Anthony Taylor: Okay, y equals that

936
01:25:22.710 --> 01:25:32.270
Anthony Taylor: alright. In this case you can see the slope is much more narrow. The Y intercept is 5.

937
01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:34.630
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

938
01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:38.500
Anthony Taylor:  so the slope of this one is point 2.

939
01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:43.009
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to multiply point 2 by our X value.

940
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:47.740
Anthony Taylor: That will give us our why vote? Sorry point to

941
01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:52.410
Anthony Taylor: by our X plus 5 will give us our Y value.

942
01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:55.520
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

943
01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:00.750
Anthony Taylor: Simplest form of predictive analytics you can do.

944
01:26:01.170 --> 01:26:07.510
Anthony Taylor: It's right here. Okay. so to do this, we need a couple of

945
01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:12.420
Anthony Taylor:  of variables. Right? So let's go back to here.

946
01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:15.910
Anthony Taylor: So what variables do we need? Well, we need the slope.

947
01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:22.060
Anthony Taylor: We need the Y intercept minimum. and we're going to need X.

948
01:26:23.230 --> 01:26:25.410
Anthony Taylor: So let's go back to here.

949
01:26:25.870 --> 01:26:29.580
Anthony Taylor: So here the lin regress method

950
01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:34.000
Anthony Taylor: takes your X value Andrew Wino

951
01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:37.940
Anthony Taylor: and returns slope

952
01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:45.260
Anthony Taylor: intercept. So there's M. And B. Our value. which we're not going to use right now.

953
01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:49.620
Anthony Taylor: P-value not going to use right now, and standard error.

954
01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:52.569
Anthony Taylor: Awesome. not gonna use right now.

955
01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:55.360
Anthony Taylor: All we care about is slope

956
01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:56.440
Anthony Taylor: an intercept.

957
01:26:58.490 --> 01:26:59.840
Anthony Taylor: MB.

958
01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:04.130
Anthony Taylor: Because we already have it. I already know what X is

959
01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:07.540
Anthony Taylor: everybody following with what this is.

960
01:27:10.170 --> 01:27:13.660
Anthony Taylor: It returns 5 variables

961
01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:17.770
Anthony Taylor: slope, intercept our value, p-value, standard error.

962
01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:22.329
Anthony Taylor: We only care about these 2, but we're gonna assign them all to a very

963
01:27:23.870 --> 01:27:25.670
Anthony Taylor: okay. Alright.

964
01:27:25.950 --> 01:27:39.330
Anthony Taylor: once you have that. we're going to actually get our regress value. And so we're gonna do X values the whole array times that slope, whatever slope this returns

965
01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:42.589
Anthony Taylor: plus the intercept

966
01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:46.479
Anthony Taylor: and that will give us regress value.

967
01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:49.620
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

968
01:27:50.880 --> 01:28:03.040
Anthony Taylor: now, this is where it really gets weird. And I'm gonna print. I'm gonna run this real quick. And then I'm gonna tell you what's going on alright. So up to here you can see we're going to plot X and regress values.

969
01:28:03.790 --> 01:28:06.970
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And we're gonna color it red.

970
01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:09.699
Anthony Taylor: And that little dash means it's gonna be a red line.

971
01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:22.280
Anthony Taylor: So here's what that means the blue dots are the actual X and Y values. This is the X values and the values that are

972
01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:25.220
Anthony Taylor: formula came up with

973
01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:32.620
Anthony Taylor: this form right here. So this is MX, plus. B.

974
01:28:34.110 --> 01:28:35.110
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

975
01:28:35.470 --> 01:28:40.800
Anthony Taylor: so the regress values is just nothing more than

976
01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:43.080
Anthony Taylor: point 4 4 times

977
01:28:43.330 --> 01:28:48.770
Anthony Taylor: whatever you know, 2.2 plus negative

978
01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:52.710
Anthony Taylor: point 19. And that gave us this wide up.

979
01:28:54.740 --> 01:29:03.239
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And so on. And so so this is what we predicted. This is the reality. All of the blue.

980
01:29:03.890 --> 01:29:07.519
Anthony Taylor: So we drew our line. That's our prediction. Now, what does that mean?

981
01:29:08.490 --> 01:29:11.630
Anthony Taylor: Well, we said, with 9 rooms

982
01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:15.120
Anthony Taylor: we can predict Y to be somewhere up here.

983
01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:19.100
Anthony Taylor: If we extended this to say 10 words.

984
01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:25.030
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we could draw this line a little further

985
01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:29.079
Anthony Taylor: and then run our little function, and we will come up with

986
01:29:30.150 --> 01:29:33.070
Anthony Taylor: 410,000 or something.

987
01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:38.880
Anthony Taylor: You understand. this lot is what we use to do predictions.

988
01:29:39.820 --> 01:29:42.920
Anthony Taylor: Now, looking at our data, I'll have to explain.

989
01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:46.270
Anthony Taylor: Probably not too good.

990
01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:48.430
Anthony Taylor: Alright, but

991
01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:50.560
Anthony Taylor: it's a nice representation.

992
01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:59.050
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so now let's talk about this formula. This is on the chart. I didn't put it there. That's not a picture

993
01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:03.980
Anthony Taylor: that actually was drawn on the chart. How do we do that?

994
01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:07.990
Anthony Taylor: Annotate.

995
01:30:08.210 --> 01:30:13.690
Anthony Taylor: So we've had plot Xlim plot, Ylm plot. X label, Bilabel title

996
01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:15.380
Anthony Taylor: legend.

997
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:18.160
Anthony Taylor: Well, now, we have annotate.

998
01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:21.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay. all it does

999
01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:25.030
Anthony Taylor: is write whatever you want it to write

1000
01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:32.820
Anthony Taylor: at the location that you tell it with the font size and the color that you choose.

1001
01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:43.660
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so line Eq, what's line? Eq, we'll check it out. This is a string Y equals round the slope to 2

1002
01:30:44.150 --> 01:30:48.249
Anthony Taylor: plus print x plus plus the intercept.

1003
01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:50.400
Anthony Taylor: And there you go

1004
01:30:51.540 --> 01:31:01.020
Anthony Taylor: alright. So it's putting it. Now, the only thing that's really important to remember about this. this value changes based on your X and Y value.

1005
01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:06.490
Anthony Taylor: Right? So if you have y values that go into hundreds

1006
01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:17.339
Anthony Taylor: and x values that go into the hundreds or even x values that go into the tens and y values and hundreds. If you did 5.8 point 8, you're gonna be like.

1007
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:23.290
Anthony Taylor: yeah, I didn't hear someone. Okay. So you have to keep in mind. This is the X and Y

1008
01:31:24.650 --> 01:31:34.800
Anthony Taylor: coordinates of where you want the annotation to show up. So we said. we said, 5.8 by point 8,

1009
01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:39.370
Anthony Taylor: you see? All right. Yeah, Mike.

1010
01:31:40.050 --> 01:31:41.719
michael mcpherson: can you use the best?

1011
01:31:42.770 --> 01:31:51.749
Anthony Taylor: An annotate is is is hard, hard type. I mean, you could programmatically come up way to get these

1012
01:31:51.890 --> 01:31:53.689
Anthony Taylor: these these values

1013
01:31:53.890 --> 01:31:56.110
Anthony Taylor: right. But

1014
01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:59.840
Anthony Taylor: but no, it it has to be, it has to be defined.

1015
01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:02.109
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now

1016
01:32:02.790 --> 01:32:06.279
Anthony Taylor: I know. I tell you guys this probably more often than I should

1017
01:32:07.610 --> 01:32:13.400
Anthony Taylor: until I started teaching the data science course. I had never in my life even seen this

1018
01:32:14.530 --> 01:32:21.890
Anthony Taylor: ever 30 years of doing this. Probably thousands

1019
01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:28.099
Anthony Taylor: of Ml models. Okay, I've never seen anybody do this, but it's really cool

1020
01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:29.830
Anthony Taylor: for projects

1021
01:32:31.110 --> 01:32:32.520
Anthony Taylor: and demonstrations.

1022
01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:34.530
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

1023
01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:41.819
Anthony Taylor: it's cool to understand what Bot annotate does, whether you put them slump those. The

1024
01:32:41.930 --> 01:32:52.750
Anthony Taylor: linear regression function there or not. You could put anything on your chart and put it anywhere you want. because you now know how. Use annotate. Yes, Claire.

1025
01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:54.770
Clayton Graves: so

1026
01:32:55.590 --> 01:33:06.230
Clayton Graves: the the, the position of the annotation. Yes, is dependent on the values of your y and your X axis. So.

1027
01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:09.050
Clayton Graves: okay, so. okay, cool.

1028
01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:13.139
Anthony Taylor: yeah, so x and y. So again, if this x was

1029
01:33:13.210 --> 01:33:20.579
Anthony Taylor: started at 20 and went to, you know 200 right your ex would be whatever

1030
01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:27.699
Anthony Taylor: X is at this point. So you know, 200 to 12.2 32 42 50, maybe 258.

1031
01:33:28.250 --> 01:33:29.910
Anthony Taylor: Alright, alright!

1032
01:33:30.020 --> 01:33:42.530
Anthony Taylor: And your Y could be all decimals depending on what you're measuring. So again, the Y would be whatever y across. Okay. alright.

1033
01:33:43.170 --> 01:33:47.150
Anthony Taylor: So let's do another average rooms versus our median value.

1034
01:33:47.310 --> 01:33:50.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Again, then, Regress X and Y,

1035
01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:52.650
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna get all these variables.

1036
01:33:52.750 --> 01:33:57.250
Anthony Taylor: We're going to calculate our regress values that calculate the red line.

1037
01:33:57.620 --> 01:34:06.040
Anthony Taylor: Okay, by basically typing out Mx, plus B, okay, we're going to

1038
01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:11.909
Anthony Taylor: create. And and again, what I tell you guys, once you have, this doesn't change

1039
01:34:12.350 --> 01:34:14.189
Anthony Taylor: the only thing that's going to change

1040
01:34:15.290 --> 01:34:21.540
Anthony Taylor: is that? And I mean, okay? And your leaves. okay, yeah, Derek.

1041
01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:42.810
Derek Rikke: so for the annotate thing, you could put in like a like X and Y value, you could put in like a point if you wanted to like highlight that or make a comment on that, you could. Yeah, yeah, you could put something else in here. I mean, we could even type something here. We can type like,

1042
01:34:42.850 --> 01:34:46.930
Anthony Taylor: this is Katie. Okay.

1043
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:54.500
Anthony Taylor: it could be anything. And you can even match it up to a single point on your your chart if you want

1044
01:34:54.710 --> 01:34:59.639
Anthony Taylor:  like, I said, I think learning annotate

1045
01:34:59.650 --> 01:35:00.920
Anthony Taylor: is a great idea.

1046
01:35:01.250 --> 01:35:05.079
Anthony Taylor: Okay, do I like? I said, have I seen this done before? Oh.

1047
01:35:05.130 --> 01:35:14.759
Anthony Taylor: you don't usually see this? Okay, I don't usually see. But again. it looks really good on a project. if all you're doing is linear regression.

1048
01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:22.780
Anthony Taylor: Something like this would look great in a project. Okay? Cause it's a really nice, clean way to show. Okay.

1049
01:35:22.850 --> 01:35:28.519
Anthony Taylor: alright. So remember, like I said, everything in here

1050
01:35:29.050 --> 01:35:32.959
Anthony Taylor: stays the same except for the position of your annotation.

1051
01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:37.890
Anthony Taylor: This is whatever your labels are. This is whatever your columns are.

1052
01:35:39.150 --> 01:35:40.080
Anthony Taylor: Alright

1053
01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:43.680
Anthony Taylor: r squared.

1054
01:35:44.430 --> 01:35:47.210
Anthony Taylor: You're gonna hear R squared a lot over the coming week.

1055
01:35:47.870 --> 01:35:56.669
Anthony Taylor: R-squared is basically our measurement of our accuracy of our model. In fact, if you were to take a machine learning model

1056
01:35:56.790 --> 01:36:02.010
Anthony Taylor: from Scikit, learn and say, give me the score of this model.

1057
01:36:02.110 --> 01:36:04.530
Anthony Taylor: It is the R squared score.

1058
01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:13.860
Anthony Taylor: Basically. the way you will read this is this is a percentage

1059
01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:18.450
Anthony Taylor: of accuracy. So

1060
01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:25.159
Anthony Taylor: this is telling me that this line is approximately 30% accurate.

1061
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:27.420
Anthony Taylor: There you go.

1062
01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:32.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay. that's what that's done

1063
01:36:33.110 --> 01:36:36.849
michael mcpherson: is that plus or minus 30% or 30% of the time.

1064
01:36:37.140 --> 01:36:42.260
Anthony Taylor: 30, right. So there is no minus 3, right can't be minus right.

1065
01:36:42.420 --> 01:36:48.940
Anthony Taylor: So it's either. It's 30% of the time. It's accurate. 75, 70% of the time it's wrong.

1066
01:36:51.130 --> 01:36:59.240
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, let's keep something in mind. And I want you guys to remember this. I don't think you have to worry about it in Project one. But I've mentioned this to you guys before

1067
01:36:59.260 --> 01:37:02.620
Anthony Taylor: anytime. You are trying to predict a number.

1068
01:37:02.700 --> 01:37:04.400
Anthony Taylor: Your scores are going to be the

1069
01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:12.790
Anthony Taylor: because think about it. A number can be wrong by one digit, and it's not wrong by one digit. It's just wrong.

1070
01:37:15.110 --> 01:37:20.260
Anthony Taylor: There is no. Well, it's almost right. Nope, it's wrong. But Nope.

1071
01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:22.650
Anthony Taylor: 0 one, that's it.

1072
01:37:24.290 --> 01:37:29.939
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so when you're doing linear regression, it's very common to have low scores.

1073
01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:33.550
Anthony Taylor: how do we get around this? We basically bid.

1074
01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:43.780
Anthony Taylor: okay? And you'll learn this later. But, like here, where they have the house prices instead of it being the exact price, we might say 0 to 100,000.

1075
01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:46.000
Anthony Taylor: 100,000 to 2,000,

1076
01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:53.830
Anthony Taylor: 2,003, 3 to 4, 4 to 5. Okay? Then maybe that's too big of being. Maybe we do 50 s. Whatever.

1077
01:37:53.940 --> 01:37:59.370
Anthony Taylor: But the point is is because it's now a bin. You have a whole lot more

1078
01:37:59.380 --> 01:38:03.200
Anthony Taylor: to get it right. Alright. hi!

1079
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:05.460
Anthony Taylor: So

1080
01:38:05.930 --> 01:38:10.970
Anthony Taylor: good news, I assume, for those that prefer to do everyone news.

1081
01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:15.290
Anthony Taylor: This next one is without question. And everyone do.

1082
01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:19.490
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're going to do this together.

1083
01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:24.990
Anthony Taylor: And if, like, if I remember correctly, it's because it's

1084
01:38:25.690 --> 01:38:26.960
Anthony Taylor: it's nutty.

1085
01:38:28.250 --> 01:38:32.330
Anthony Taylor: It's one of those ones where they have. You do a lot of stuff that we didn't show you.

1086
01:38:33.490 --> 01:38:35.990
Anthony Taylor: and I don't think that's fun or useful.

1087
01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:40.930
Anthony Taylor: not in 20Â min, anyway. But

1088
01:38:41.250 --> 01:38:43.110
Anthony Taylor: so here we go.

1089
01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:50.020
Anthony Taylor: But do do it with me, or at least watch closely and do it later.

1090
01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:58.710
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So we're going to bring in Sci-fi. We're going to bring in pandas numpy. We're going to read in this really cool vehicle data.

1091
01:38:59.010 --> 01:39:00.380
Anthony Taylor: Not a whole lot of data.

1092
01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:04.619
Anthony Taylor: Alright, in fact, very curious. What we're going to be predicting.

1093
01:39:04.980 --> 01:39:10.750
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So it says, generate a scatter plot your versus number. All right. So let's

1094
01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:32.720
Anthony Taylor:  understand why it's doing that. So we're gonna try to just do it and see what happens.

1095
01:39:35.770 --> 01:39:37.850
Anthony Taylor: So for year.

1096
01:39:43.410 --> 01:39:49.809
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so bottom line, this has a weird filter on it, and it doesn't explain why it has the filter.

1097
01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:56.179
Anthony Taylor:  I'm gonna go ahead and put the filter on it, because I'm sure there's a good reason for it.

1098
01:39:57.190 --> 01:40:02.700
Anthony Taylor: but don't know off the top of my head why, I'd have to go look at the data, which is what you would do.

1099
01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:07.350
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So what they're basically saying is is, make sure the type

1100
01:40:07.570 --> 01:40:10.880
Anthony Taylor: equals cars. Okay.

1101
01:40:13.770 --> 01:40:20.180
Anthony Taylor: and make sure that's the right punctuation. And

1102
01:40:22.170 --> 01:40:28.360
Anthony Taylor: so we went. Type equals cars. Let's wrap this in parentheses, because we're into an. And also

1103
01:40:31.130 --> 01:40:37.079
Anthony Taylor: I have to wonder. You know what I'm gonna check and see if this is even in the reading, this might be why I decided to do this, guys

1104
01:40:37.370 --> 01:40:40.779
Anthony Taylor: let me check because it's nuts that.

1105
01:40:46.460 --> 01:40:51.310
Anthony Taylor: So it does mention it only once. Petro-electric cars.

1106
01:40:53.700 --> 01:40:54.840
Anthony Taylor: Interesting.

1107
01:40:57.670 --> 01:40:58.350
Anthony Taylor: Huh?

1108
01:41:00.190 --> 01:41:04.369
Anthony Taylor: Okay. alright. So back to what we were doing.

1109
01:41:08.370 --> 01:41:13.979
Anthony Taylor: alright. So we're gonna get. We're gonna make sure it's a car. And then we're going to do Ampersand

1110
01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:17.469
Anthony Taylor: and make sure that the engine is petroleum.

1111
01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:21.029
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're gonna do vehicle data

1112
01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:22.170
Anthony Taylor: brackets.

1113
01:41:22.940 --> 01:41:24.020
Engine

1114
01:41:26.490 --> 01:41:30.150
Anthony Taylor: equals equals petrol

1115
01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:35.250
Anthony Taylor: dash, electric.

1116
01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:42.930
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And we could see there's a petrol electric. There's cars.

1117
01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:45.889
Anthony Taylor: There we go. And the column we want

1118
01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:47.809
Anthony Taylor: is just a year.

1119
01:41:48.990 --> 01:41:49.960
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

1120
01:41:50.110 --> 01:42:00.229
Anthony Taylor: So it's got a filter. Only give us data that has type equals car engine equals petrol electric, and we want the year value. So before we go any further.

1121
01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:02.220
Anthony Taylor: let's just look at that.

1122
01:42:03.250 --> 01:42:04.730
Anthony Taylor: And I did something.

1123
01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:07.259
Anthony Taylor: Oh, this needs to be in quotes.

1124
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:17.620
Anthony Taylor: There you go. So there's our data that looks okay. Okay. So now we're gonna do the same thing.

1125
01:42:21.490 --> 01:42:30.100
Anthony Taylor: But for a new variable called petroelectric cars. So we're gonna do petrol underscore electric cars equals

1126
01:42:30.330 --> 01:42:38.040
Anthony Taylor: paste, that everything stays the same. But the last variable is

1127
01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:40.469
Anthony Taylor: number instead of year.

1128
01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:48.780
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Which means we're going to plot our

1129
01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:53.159
Anthony Taylor: year. And how many of that are

1130
01:42:53.230 --> 01:42:56.969
Anthony Taylor: there is? So let's do that. So plot scatter.

1131
01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:03.470
Anthony Taylor: and we're going to pass in year and petrol.

1132
01:43:06.220 --> 01:43:10.830
Anthony Taylor: Why is it not coming up there petro-electric cars.

1133
01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:17.910
Anthony Taylor: And let's just show that just to make sure it's working, we're gonna we're gonna dress it up. But.

1134
01:43:18.110 --> 01:43:19.979
Anthony Taylor: darn it, what's wrong?

1135
01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:24.659
Dipinto, Matt: Then double equals.

1136
01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:31.860
Anthony Taylor: Wow, Matt. good. Okay. There, I see what I did there.

1137
01:43:32.330 --> 01:43:35.569
Anthony Taylor: Nobody caught and yelled at. And but that's all right, too.

1138
01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:40.229
Anthony Taylor: I put a double equals there. You can't do that. That's for comparing, not for a site.

1139
01:43:40.850 --> 01:43:47.419
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So here's what it looks like year by year by year. Look at this 2,016 holy, moly

1140
01:43:47.770 --> 01:43:52.030
Anthony Taylor: petroelectric cars went up a little bit alright.

1141
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:59.609
Anthony Taylor: So now that we have that this isn't very readable. So let's add a couple of quick things. Let's add some X ticks.

1142
01:44:00.950 --> 01:44:07.410
Anthony Taylor: and we're gonna do years. So it knows that. But we're going to rotate.

1143
01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:11.700
Anthony Taylor: Aye.

1144
01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:15.900
Anthony Taylor: and then we're going to do? Not years your

1145
01:44:18.150 --> 01:44:23.460
Anthony Taylor:  We're going to do the label.

1146
01:44:24.250 --> 01:44:33.250
Anthony Taylor: the Ltdex label. and we'll just say years. There, we can do years. And then Y label

1147
01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:36.840
Anthony Taylor: petrol

1148
01:44:37.870 --> 01:44:39.070
Anthony Taylor: electric.

1149
01:44:40.930 --> 01:44:47.250
Anthony Taylor: of course. And there we go. Not bad. Okay.

1150
01:44:47.470 --> 01:44:51.500
Anthony Taylor: alright. So now that we have that, let's do our linear regression.

1151
01:44:51.650 --> 01:44:52.550
Anthony Taylor: So

1152
01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:58.759
Anthony Taylor: remember, now, I'm gonna well, let's keep it simple. In fact, let's keep it so simple.

1153
01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:05.920
Anthony Taylor: I'll grab this. bring it here.

1154
01:45:06.670 --> 01:45:16.310
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And the only thing we gotta do is change our X and Y to match our X and Y up here, which is year and petrole electric cars. So we're gonna change this to year.

1155
01:45:19.580 --> 01:45:21.090
Anthony Taylor: and this to petrol

1156
01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:26.560
Anthony Taylor: electric cars  and that.

1157
01:45:26.610 --> 01:45:29.970
Anthony Taylor: And it doesn't like it. Why not? What's missing

1158
01:45:37.140 --> 01:45:41.570
McKimmy, Brandon: the dependencies? You have to import a request?

1159
01:45:44.340 --> 01:45:53.309
Anthony Taylor: Actually, you're right. But I did. I did actually bring in the dependency I needed just didn't add it to the

1160
01:45:53.850 --> 01:46:00.970
Anthony Taylor: the thing. So yeah, we could have brought lingress in our directly. This we just brought in stats. So now we have it.

1161
01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:02.190
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1162
01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:07.820
Anthony Taylor: So now that we have that, all of our values are filled in, let's just create

1163
01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:15.040
Anthony Taylor: our our regress line. So we'll say, fit equals. We're going to do slope

1164
01:46:16.650 --> 01:46:23.150
Anthony Taylor: times year plus intercept.

1165
01:46:24.270 --> 01:46:27.349
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So that'll give us our fit.

1166
01:46:28.870 --> 01:46:31.590
Anthony Taylor: No issue there. And then

1167
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:37.010
Anthony Taylor: why, in God's name, would you do this? So we're going to copy this whole thing.

1168
01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:42.430
Anthony Taylor: and we're simply gonna add

1169
01:46:42.610 --> 01:46:46.379
Anthony Taylor: our our re, our fit line

1170
01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:59.370
Anthony Taylor: and our annotation. Actually, we don't even that's so. They have to. That's funny. No way. they're so silly. So they didn't put the annotation on any of the activity.

1171
01:46:59.420 --> 01:47:08.039
Meredith McCanse (she/her): But we could just fit just like a word. You're calling it like Bob.

1172
01:47:08.230 --> 01:47:17.500
Meredith McCanse (she/her): or is that a term? Okay? So the short answer, yes, the reason I call it fit is as we go into machine learning every time we

1173
01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:20.120
Anthony Taylor: we're we're gonna fit every model.

1174
01:47:20.890 --> 01:47:25.969
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And this is, this is technically what we're doing here is the fit step.

1175
01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:29.829
Anthony Taylor: But you're right. It's just a variable. It could be any.

1176
01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:32.759
Anthony Taylor: I just put it there. So it makes sense.

1177
01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:40.019
Anthony Taylor: Did you had to import something extra to get the slope.

1178
01:47:40.130 --> 01:47:45.300
Anthony Taylor: This is what happened here. We did stats here.

1179
01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:49.450
Anthony Taylor: We did. Lynn regress from stacked.

1180
01:47:50.450 --> 01:47:51.450
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay.

1181
01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:57.840
Anthony Taylor: you see the difference. So this, when we said from stats, give them request. So we didn't need to say stack

1182
01:47:58.210 --> 01:48:02.479
Anthony Taylor: here we just did step that probably did it in your solution.

1183
01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:05.459
Anthony Taylor: So we had to tell it. Stats doctrine.

1184
01:48:06.390 --> 01:48:07.840
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Oh, okay.

1185
01:48:08.380 --> 01:48:16.109
Anthony Taylor: can you print out the fit variable? Is that a list that just every.

1186
01:48:18.890 --> 01:48:20.089
Dipinto, Matt: okay. Thank you.

1187
01:48:20.340 --> 01:48:21.120
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

1188
01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:22.750
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So

1189
01:48:23.260 --> 01:48:33.310
Anthony Taylor: now we have our scatter. Let's go ahead and add our fit line. So it's just a plot. This is just a line, right? We're gonna say, year comma fit.

1190
01:48:33.450 --> 01:48:36.530
Anthony Taylor: And we're going to tell it. We want it to be a dashed line.

1191
01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:44.629
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So now, when we run this. we could see there's our fit line. So this is what our

1192
01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:50.570
Anthony Taylor: slope function came up with as our fit money.

1193
01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:54.120
Anthony Taylor: Okay. fairly simple.

1194
01:48:54.690 --> 01:49:01.700
Anthony Taylor: Okay, nothing, nothing, too. Fancy. Now, here's what's kinda cool. And we could, in fact, if if I was

1195
01:49:02.210 --> 01:49:04.509
Anthony Taylor: given this to you guys right now.

1196
01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:11.520
Anthony Taylor: right, we could technically turn this into a function. Okay, so since we have.

1197
01:49:12.380 --> 01:49:16.789
Anthony Taylor: we know how to do this. Now. let's add it to our

1198
01:49:18.010 --> 01:49:25.260
Anthony Taylor: our charge. Okay, we are, gonna change the very, actually, maybe not.

1199
01:49:25.330 --> 01:49:29.140
Anthony Taylor:  And let's add the fit line

1200
01:49:30.530 --> 01:49:31.630
Anthony Taylor: also.

1201
01:49:36.430 --> 01:49:42.419
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so here, what do we do? Different cars, engine petrol, electric

1202
01:49:45.490 --> 01:49:48.830
Anthony Taylor: for year versus why is it having us do it again? No.

1203
01:49:50.670 --> 01:49:53.400
Anthony Taylor: Taipei was car engines. Petrol.

1204
01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:09.199
Anthony Taylor: Oh, oh, I see. Okay. So this chart. We're gonna change to just petrol.

1205
01:50:10.190 --> 01:50:15.190
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And that's it. So if you were, gonna do that, you should change this variable.

1206
01:50:16.270 --> 01:50:20.859
Anthony Taylor: which again, if we made this into a function. We could just do this one time.

1207
01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:25.970
Anthony Taylor: but we didn't yet, so we'll just

1208
01:50:26.260 --> 01:50:28.169
Anthony Taylor: manually fix this.

1209
01:50:32.050 --> 01:50:38.869
Anthony Taylor: And there you go. So what did we change there. All we did is we changed it from

1210
01:50:39.270 --> 01:50:41.779
Anthony Taylor: we changed the

1211
01:50:42.130 --> 01:50:53.020
Anthony Taylor: Why, we actually didn't need. We didn't even need this in there, because this is not changing. So we just changed the Y value to be a petrol car instead of a petrol electric.

1212
01:50:53.670 --> 01:50:55.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so if we take this whole thing.

1213
01:50:57.790 --> 01:51:04.699
Anthony Taylor: How much time do we got? Oh, gosh! Almost done. Okay. So we'll do the same thing except this time. It will be just electric.

1214
01:51:06.860 --> 01:51:12.940
Anthony Taylor: I'm just gonna leave the variable the same, so that we don't have to change it everywhere. But no, you would normally want to change it.

1215
01:51:15.970 --> 01:51:18.930
Anthony Taylor: And we run that. Now, you can see electric cars.

1216
01:51:20.830 --> 01:51:21.790
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1217
01:51:23.580 --> 01:51:27.239
Anthony Taylor:  okay, this last one.

1218
01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:34.310
Anthony Taylor: Oh, wait. Is there a Diesel? One also doesn't say to do Diesel. Huh?

1219
01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:36.490
Anthony Taylor: Interesting? Oh.

1220
01:51:38.150 --> 01:51:39.030
Anthony Taylor: okay.

1221
01:51:42.090 --> 01:51:42.990
Anthony Taylor: alright.

1222
01:51:43.710 --> 01:51:48.820
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna run a little over and think we would. But alright. So we're gonna create a new figure.

1223
01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:53.059
Anthony Taylor: Try to hang in there for this guys, this is really cool. This used to be on the homework.

1224
01:51:55.220 --> 01:52:01.150
Anthony Taylor: So I've I've told you guys many times that we were creating a figure and one

1225
01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:03.180
Anthony Taylor: chart in that figure.

1226
01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:04.910
Anthony Taylor: Well, this time

1227
01:52:04.980 --> 01:52:16.670
Anthony Taylor: we're going to create 3 charts in that figure. Okay? So we're gonna do plot subplots. And then we're going to say, 3

1228
01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:20.650
Anthony Taylor: comma share X

1229
01:52:20.910 --> 01:52:22.330
Anthony Taylor: equals. True.

1230
01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:31.379
Anthony Taylor: Okay, what's that mean? I'm gonna create 3 charts in one canvas, and they're all gonna have the same X value.

1231
01:52:31.780 --> 01:52:33.710
Anthony Taylor: So

1232
01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:43.870
Anthony Taylor: well, maybe we do. I don't know. We'll see. So first, we're going to create the first one. So we'll do acts one

1233
01:52:45.230 --> 01:52:46.900
Anthony Taylor: dot plot.

1234
01:52:48.030 --> 01:52:55.110
Anthony Taylor: and we're going to do basically the one from up above. So we're going to say, year comma petrol.

1235
01:52:55.290 --> 01:53:03.929
Anthony Taylor: electric cars. Oh, I'm gonna I messed up by not changing that variable. That's all right. We'll fix it and we're going to give this one a line width.

1236
01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:07.670
Anthony Taylor: So it's not a scatterplot. Okay.

1237
01:53:08.150 --> 01:53:12.249
Anthony Taylor: and it's gonna equal one. And we're gonna give it a marker of

1238
01:53:15.250 --> 01:53:17.440
Anthony Taylor: 0. Okay?

1239
01:53:17.630 --> 01:53:19.850
Anthony Taylor: So there's our first

1240
01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:26.040
Anthony Taylor:  we can do our fit line also. So we can say

1241
01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:33.429
Anthony Taylor: I'm just gonna copy this paste it here. and this is gonna be, oh,

1242
01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:45.760
Anthony Taylor: Cause we named everything exactly the same. This isn't gonna work as well as I'd like. But that's okay. Still, show you how to do alright. So we're gonna put the fit line here. not the fert line that would be weird.

1243
01:53:46.170 --> 01:53:49.529
Anthony Taylor: And this one is gonna be

1244
01:53:50.950 --> 01:53:52.040
Anthony Taylor: blue

1245
01:53:52.290 --> 01:53:54.729
Anthony Taylor: dash, dash in quotes.

1246
01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:03.450
Anthony Taylor: and then we're gonna keep our line width at one. We don't need a marker.

1247
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:09.139
Anthony Taylor: But we do need to close it alright. So

1248
01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:15.280
Anthony Taylor: it's all that's the minimum we need for a single axis. So I'm gonna copy this.

1249
01:54:15.300 --> 01:54:20.190
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna do axis 2. Okay. Try to do 2

1250
01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:26.940
Anthony Taylor: 2 now, because we didn't name the fit differently every time.

1251
01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:34.990
Anthony Taylor:  we're going to end up with the same fit line, which is not accurate. But it'll be fine.

1252
01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:39.139
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And this marker, we're gonna make a

1253
01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:45.549
Anthony Taylor: why like that. And our fit line for this one will also make y.

1254
01:54:46.100 --> 01:54:48.280
Anthony Taylor: And then we're gonna do a third one.

1255
01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:55.930
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And this one will be if I change it

1256
01:54:57.680 --> 01:54:58.960
Meredith McCanse (she/her): electric.

1257
01:54:59.570 --> 01:55:05.110
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And we'll rerun that we'll rerun that

1258
01:55:07.050 --> 01:55:13.600
Anthony Taylor: alright that way. They won't be identical, at least this one. We're going to make green.

1259
01:55:15.020 --> 01:55:17.119
Anthony Taylor: And we're going to make this line green.

1260
01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:20.460
Anthony Taylor: And technically, that's all you

1261
01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:22.429
absolutely have to help.

1262
01:55:22.450 --> 01:55:28.530
Anthony Taylor:  you could also. And I'll send it on one of these because we're so late. And I don't wanna

1263
01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:36.350
Anthony Taylor: mess you guys up. You can set the Y label for each one of these. So this is, you know, petrol, electric

1264
01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:43.140
Anthony Taylor: alright. And then

1265
01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:45.479
Anthony Taylor: well, I guess we can do it.

1266
01:55:48.170 --> 01:55:51.570
Anthony Taylor: This one's just electric. Oh, no, just petrol.

1267
01:55:54.620 --> 01:55:57.680
Anthony Taylor: And this one's just like.

1268
01:55:58.760 --> 01:55:59.890
Anthony Taylor: is that gonna work?

1269
01:56:01.470 --> 01:56:05.880
Meredith McCanse (she/her): You gotta change the way access.

1270
01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:16.759
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. So now we have our Y labels. We can send an app the next label on this the bottom one. Wait a minute. Let me change all of these.

1271
01:56:17.420 --> 01:56:18.510
Anthony Taylor: mess that up.

1272
01:56:19.940 --> 01:56:28.179
Anthony Taylor: We could set an X label on the bottom one, because that'll show up underneath everything. But that's really all we need to get this to work. So let's do plot, show

1273
01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:31.490
Anthony Taylor: and dark.

1274
01:56:31.950 --> 01:56:33.979
Anthony Taylor: Where's it?

1275
01:56:34.180 --> 01:56:37.510
Sihong Zhou: Figure so sub sub plug.

1276
01:56:37.770 --> 01:56:39.740
Sihong Zhou: You need an s

1277
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:43.150
Sihong Zhou: nice Cindy.

1278
01:56:45.490 --> 01:56:50.159
Anthony Taylor: Oh, darn! It could not convert string to float! Why did I not?

1279
01:56:51.610 --> 01:56:55.710
Anthony Taylor: Where is that one? A pathmarker?

1280
01:56:57.220 --> 01:57:00.079
Anthony Taylor: It's somewhere in my marker code.

1281
01:57:01.490 --> 01:57:04.590
Dipinto, Matt: I think it's the yellow dash! Dash that it's not liking.

1282
01:57:05.950 --> 01:57:07.029
Dipinto, Matt: or never mind.

1283
01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:08.950
Anthony Taylor: Hmm!

1284
01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:11.889
Anthony Taylor: That's interesting.

1285
01:57:12.850 --> 01:57:18.080
Anthony Taylor: So color! Oh, oh, oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! The first ones marker! These 2 are color.

1286
01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:21.810
Anthony Taylor: There we go.

1287
01:57:24.210 --> 01:57:29.070
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. well, the lines are weird. But

1288
01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:34.099
Anthony Taylor: basically, this is how you would create a multi chart chart.

1289
01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:40.199
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you'd have your figure. You tell it how many axes you want, and then you would be, and

1290
01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:44.140
Anthony Taylor: everything we do in a single chart. You can do here.

1291
01:57:44.860 --> 01:57:54.809
Anthony Taylor: Okay. The only thing I would avoid is putting an X label on each one because they're all using the same one. So if you just put it on the last one. the bottom one.

1292
01:57:56.550 --> 01:57:58.610
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1293
01:58:04.460 --> 01:58:05.879
Anthony Taylor: it makes more sense.

1294
01:58:07.740 --> 01:58:08.620
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1295
01:58:10.680 --> 01:58:11.709
Anthony Taylor: pretty cool.

1296
01:58:13.170 --> 01:58:14.209
Anthony Taylor: That's pretty cool.

1297
01:58:15.380 --> 01:58:16.659
Anthony Taylor: and that's it.

1298
01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:20.220
Anthony Taylor: Oh.

1299
01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:24.349
Anthony Taylor: oh, alright! I'm just gonna bring this one in. You guys are, gonna get this in the solution.

1300
01:58:24.380 --> 01:58:29.280
Anthony Taylor: So it says, calculate for 2,024. Well, before I do it.

1301
01:58:29.340 --> 01:58:32.260
Anthony Taylor: how would we do that? We know?

1302
01:58:32.550 --> 01:58:35.759
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we we have slope

1303
01:58:36.550 --> 01:58:50.680
Anthony Taylor: right? I'll get it right eventually. times year plus intercept. Okay. But we have all of we have slope, and we have intercept.

1304
01:58:51.870 --> 01:59:03.600
Anthony Taylor: So all we have to do is set the year equal to something. Okay? And then output

1305
01:59:05.150 --> 01:59:07.069
Anthony Taylor: whatever this value is.

1306
01:59:11.820 --> 01:59:16.709
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And what did I miss? Oh.

1307
01:59:19.170 --> 01:59:21.240
Anthony Taylor: we have to make this into

1308
01:59:23.910 --> 01:59:26.040
Anthony Taylor: and and wait. See?

1309
01:59:26.130 --> 01:59:28.359
Anthony Taylor: Slope plus year

1310
01:59:29.380 --> 01:59:34.590
Anthony Taylor: sometimes here, plus intercept. Where is my is? Oh, wait! Did I not call it intercept?

1311
01:59:35.870 --> 01:59:38.640
Anthony Taylor: Oh! Spelled it out

1312
01:59:40.730 --> 01:59:44.140
Anthony Taylor: even I forgot that one. Sorry. And there you go.

1313
01:59:44.270 --> 01:59:47.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So this is saying, in 2,024,

1314
01:59:48.290 --> 01:59:49.790
Anthony Taylor: we will have

1315
01:59:50.530 --> 01:59:55.140
Anthony Taylor: 64, 645,370 electric cars

1316
01:59:58.560 --> 02:00:02.079
Anthony Taylor: interesting. So we were able to predict it.

1317
02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.940
Anthony Taylor: because we already had the rest of the function, the formula.

1318
02:00:08.610 --> 02:00:14.030
Anthony Taylor: alright. Any questions? We went over a little bit. Sorry, guys.

1319
02:00:17.210 --> 02:00:26.569
Anthony Taylor: are you glad I didn't try to make you guys do this one by yourself. He would have been really pissed at me because you're like, we've never seen that ever

1320
02:00:26.690 --> 02:00:28.180
Anthony Taylor: it's like, Oh.

1321
02:00:30.660 --> 02:00:44.010
Anthony Taylor: but yeah. Hi. that's it, guys what is it? Monday? So tomorrow we start time series, predictive analytics. It's the beginning of machine learning.

1322
02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:46.440
Anthony Taylor: This is where we start

1323
02:00:48.140 --> 02:00:52.119
Anthony Taylor: breaking away from data engineering and becoming data scientists.

1324
02:00:53.890 --> 02:01:02.420
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I know we're gonna wear your lab coats. It'll be great. Okay, thanks. Guys have a good night. We'll be here till 11.
