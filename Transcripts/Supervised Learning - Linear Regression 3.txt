00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.810
Anthony Taylor: Welcome everybody.

2
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.599
Anthony Taylor: Well. so day three's

3
00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:05.190
Anthony Taylor: in this year. Boot Camp, as you guys have found, can be very interesting and varying.  Today's interesting

4
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.729
Anthony Taylor: and buried.

5
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.719
Anthony Taylor: We're going to do

6
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.220
Anthony Taylor: one more very important lecture

7
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.159
Anthony Taylor: that they have made incredibly complicated, and I would do my best to simplify it for you

8
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.340
Anthony Taylor: and then

9
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.520
Anthony Taylor: you are going to spend 2 h in your groups doing a project

10
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.590
Anthony Taylor: exciting, huh?

11
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:41.509
Anthony Taylor: And I'd say, Hey, you could leave early if you get done except can't, because the last 30 min is going to be you guys presenting

12
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.079
Anthony Taylor: what you did? Doesn't that sound like fuck?

13
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.950
Anthony Taylor: That's what I thought. But I couldn't get my theme ready for you fast enough.

14
00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:00.970
Anthony Taylor:  so we're gonna start with, believe, this isn't everyone do? Yeah.

15
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.959
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna do a quick review of everything we've learned so far.

16
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.129
Anthony Taylor: In and everyone there. And I said, Look, Matt put his thump down.

17
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.209
Anthony Taylor: Dog, got it, Matt.

18
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.009
Anthony Taylor: that's all right. I kind of felt the same way. I'm being totally honest.

19
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.810
Anthony Taylor: I was hoping to get that

20
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.489
Anthony Taylor: length chain thing put together for you, but

21
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.649
Anthony Taylor: I just got busy with other things.

22
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.440
Anthony Taylor: Damn real life work.

23
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.639
Masarirambi, Rodney: We did. Can we just blame James and Kevin?

24
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.660
Anthony Taylor: Why?

25
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.859
Anthony Taylor: Oh, cause the tas? Yeah, of course. Yeah.

26
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.069
Masarirambi, Rodney: I'm like, who the hell is James Kevin?

27
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:58.449
Anthony Taylor: You know the people you work with that's right. Forgot about them. No, it wasn't their work. It was like real life work, day job work.

28
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.799
Anthony Taylor:  yeah. Today was was a busy day, which is highly unusual. I usually don't have very busy days.

29
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.330
Anthony Taylor: I usually can like

30
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.929
Anthony Taylor: do all kinds of fun stuff. But that's it.

31
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:19.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so we're gonna do what everyone do. This is a. this is very similar or not similar. This will be a combination

32
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.660
Anthony Taylor: of all the stuff been learning. So please follow along.

33
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:33.620
Anthony Taylor:  so we're going to bring in train test split linear regression. These are pretty much everything you've learned over the past.

34
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.520
Anthony Taylor: Okay. we're going to bring in some data. This is rent data.

35
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.019
Anthony Taylor: We actually have seen this data before.

36
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:58.969
Anthony Taylor:  we're going to get rid of our nulls. And the way that we've all discussed is not probably the right way. and we're going to create our ex. So all of our feature set by dropping the price column.

37
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.650
Anthony Taylor: we end up with this. That's beautiful.

38
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.339
Anthony Taylor:  we're just going to select. We're not going to use any cool tricks to do it.

39
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:18.910
Anthony Taylor: But we're gonna select these columns only. Oh, but they actually do want us to code. So let's write some code.

40
00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:21.629
Anthony Taylor: So basically, all it wants is to do

41
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.480
Anthony Taylor: is create another X variable

42
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.200
Anthony Taylor: X select

43
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:36.579
Anthony Taylor: and set it equal or or just pass in the data from those columns. So all we got to do say, df

44
00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.380
Anthony Taylor: select features

45
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.980
Anthony Taylor:  and then we can take a look at what we got.

46
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.590
Anthony Taylor: Oh, my goodness.

47
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.400
Anthony Taylor: And there we go. So now we have just these features.

48
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

49
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.509
Anthony Taylor: and now we need to set our target variable, which, as we know, is priced because up here we dropped it.

50
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:12.180
Anthony Taylor: So we know that that's actually the one we're going to use as our target variables. So we'll say, Y equals data frame

51
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.710
Anthony Taylor: slicing price.

52
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.680
Anthony Taylor: and then we'll go ahead and reshape it to one

53
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.619
Anthony Taylor: by one. And do you need to do this?

54
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:34.929
Anthony Taylor: Probably not. Actually, it was Derek, that showed me this the other day that, hey? You don't even need to do that. It's like, yeah.

55
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.370
Anthony Taylor: okay.

56
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:51.500
Anthony Taylor: and then we're gonna do our train test split. So this is the full and the select. So X underscore full underscore Train X underscore full underscore test

57
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.710
Anthony Taylor: S. Underscore selected

58
00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.200
Anthony Taylor: Underscore train

59
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.510
Anthony Taylor: X underscore selected underscore.

60
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.790
Anthony Taylor: Why underscore train?

61
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.549
Anthony Taylor: Why underscore tests.

62
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:16.469
Anthony Taylor: guys, this is probably the best time. If you guys have questions about

63
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:25.550
Anthony Taylor: any of this stuff to ask cause we got a lot of that. We can spare questions.

64
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.030
Anthony Taylor: So this is the time to ask.

65
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.280
Anthony Taylor: Don't wait. I mean, I know you guys are like, well, we don't have a possible challenge. So

66
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.210
Anthony Taylor: okay, so there, we've done our split.

67
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.329
Anthony Taylor: Yes, Natalie, I don't know why it didn't beep. It should have beeped.

68
00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:53.830
Mason, Natalie: Can you please remind me why we would drop price and then bring it back?

69
00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:02.390
Anthony Taylor: We didn't bring it back. So so first we dropped it, because that's our, our, the very, the.

70
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.060
Mason, Natalie: That's what we're trying to predict.

71
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.079
Mason, Natalie: Okay? So you don't want to give the model the answer.

72
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.670
Mason, Natalie: Okay, alright. Well.

73
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:23.310
Anthony Taylor: you do. But but you want to make sure that it's not part of the feature set. So for X. It's like Anthony taking answers off the test before he gives us the test

74
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:29.649
Anthony Taylor: right? Sort of right? So here we're saying, we need the features

75
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.110
Anthony Taylor: to predict price. We're going to take Price out of those features.

76
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.890
Anthony Taylor: Okay, cause it would weigh an awful lot if the actual answer was in the feature set

77
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:49.620
Anthony Taylor: and then all we're doing here is putting so notice we when we dropped it, we created a new data frame. So we didn't drop it from

78
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:50.979
Anthony Taylor: the actual data.

79
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:57.649
Anthony Taylor: The actual data frame still has price. So down here, we're simply assigning price

80
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:06.450
Anthony Taylor: to a variable that we're going to pass into a model as answer. Here's the answer right here. Train to predict this answer.

81
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:10.959
Mason, Natalie: Gotcha, does that make sense? Thank you for clarifying that. I like the question.

82
00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.710
Anthony Taylor: good question.

83
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:19.330
Anthony Taylor: alright. So we're gonna create our models. This isn't hard. We've been doing models now for a while. So we're going to say.

84
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:25.879
Anthony Taylor: equals linear regression. All we're working on today.

85
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And we're going to do 2 of it.

86
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.289
Anthony Taylor: one for our full and one for our select.

87
00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:36.690
Anthony Taylor: Alright. then we're gonna fit them.

88
00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:44.400
Anthony Taylor: Pretty exciting. Actually, this is fit the first one. So lr, one that fit. And we're gonna pass in all full

89
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:49.550
Anthony Taylor: training data and labels. X, 4,

90
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:53.750
Anthony Taylor: underscore train comma. Why underscore train.

91
00:08:54.490 --> 00:09:01.950
Anthony Taylor: and then down here it says fit the second. So LR. 2. That's it. X selected

92
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.870
Anthony Taylor: underscore train comma.

93
00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:07.129
Anthony Taylor: Why underscore train.

94
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:14.570
Anthony Taylor: So now we've trained 2 models, one with all the columns, and one with the select few

95
00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.170
Anthony Taylor: alright questions about that.

96
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.100
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

97
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:27.520
Anthony Taylor: So let's make predictions with our model. So we're gonna do a predicted variable.

98
00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:32.219
Anthony Taylor: predicted one equals LR. One dot for

99
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.990
Anthony Taylor: what the heck just happened there.

100
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.180
LR. One predict.

101
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:49.960
Anthony Taylor:  x. This drove me. Because it wants you to calculate the mean squared error before you do the prediction

102
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:55.309
Anthony Taylor: where I mean, we're doing the prediction right here.

103
00:09:55.370 --> 00:10:01.940
Clayton Graves: Yeah. But if you look above in the green, this is calculated. Yeah, this is for the wholesale.

104
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.279
Anthony Taylor: This is the instructions for the wholesale. It was, it is.

105
00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:14.180
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, that's not. Yeah. I can see why. Cause that's not normally how they do it. But that's what they this. That's the directions for the whole cell.

106
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.470
Anthony Taylor: So

107
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:19.250
Anthony Taylor: yeah, you're you're not off. It's you're I see your point.

108
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:32.009
Anthony Taylor: X underscore select underscore test. Good. Now we'll do. We're and we're gonna follow the variables they use here. So we'll have Mse one

109
00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:40.920
Anthony Taylor: equals. And we're going to use the mean squared error function and ask Y underscore test

110
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.269
Anthony Taylor: and predicted what?

111
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

112
00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:59.059
Anthony Taylor: And then we'll do the same for R. 2 1.

113
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:03.410
Hmm.

114
00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.770
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna say, one values.

115
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.240
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. This is faster, but it feels faster

116
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.350
Anthony Taylor: as I'm moving my hands. Okay, and then we'll do MSE. 2

117
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:31.920
Anthony Taylor: equals. And honestly, I'm just gonna take this. Actually, I'm going to take all of this copy paste. change that to 2

118
00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.760
Anthony Taylor: that the 2

119
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:41.110
Anthony Taylor: that to. and that too.

120
00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:45.139
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And we run that.

121
00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.909
Anthony Taylor: And we see these. These scores are bad.

122
00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:51.570
Anthony Taylor: But that's it.

123
00:11:52.280 --> 00:12:01.289
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we can see it did go down with the adjusted or with the smaller. Actually, this is kind of an interesting one. When we selected the features it actually got worse.

124
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.350
Anthony Taylor: which is interesting, but if you look at the features we selected, they were terrible.

125
00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.160
Anthony Taylor: I mean literally terror.

126
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.030
Anthony Taylor: But whatever

127
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:18.760
Anthony Taylor:  now we can do adjusted. And it's just going to show it gets worse still.

128
00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:23.139
Anthony Taylor:  so for the adjusted

129
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:25.120
Anthony Taylor: really.

130
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.759
Anthony Taylor: is there a way I can speed this up? Not really. So we're gonna do adjusted score.

131
00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:37.050
Anthony Taylor: One equals our new function we just made.

132
00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.700
Anthony Taylor: We're going to pass in the full test.

133
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.249
Anthony Taylor: You know. What's happening is is my. It's my watch.

134
00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.659
Anthony Taylor: I don't usually wear a watch, and I just got this one bearing it.

135
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:55.940
Anthony Taylor: and it's causing me to have my hands on the keyboard in a weird way. Aye.

136
00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:01.909
Anthony Taylor: feel so much better without much. But now my heart rate is being monitored.

137
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:07.689
Anthony Taylor: You know, you need your heart rate monitored at all.

138
00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:15.340
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And we're gonna pass in our what?

139
00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:19.079
Anthony Taylor: And we're going to do the same thing.

140
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.959
Anthony Taylor: So we'll copy and paste. Make this 2

141
00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:31.429
Anthony Taylor: and make this 2. And we're flying.

142
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:38.180
Anthony Taylor:  okay, so prints.

143
00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:42.169
Anthony Taylor: Oh, where we got all features

144
00:13:54.310 --> 00:14:01.070
Anthony Taylor: and oops. That's totally wrong. Did that the old-fashioned way.

145
00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:05.030
Anthony Taylor: God! I haven't done that in so long

146
00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:08.110
Anthony Taylor: using that method.

147
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.560
Anthony Taylor: I don't even know if we showed you that man

148
00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:24.880
Anthony Taylor: alright.

149
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:28.640
Anthony Taylor: Oh.

150
00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:32.780
Anthony Taylor: what did I do?

151
00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:36.679
Anthony Taylor: We have a value error.

152
00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:50.439
Anthony Taylor: Anybody see what I did.

153
00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:59.629
Vasquez, Gabriel: Was it because you put up the full test on the score? The second score.

154
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:06.289
Anthony Taylor: Betty? It is because it's a different set than what's in the train.

155
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:09.829
Anthony Taylor: Look at that good job, Dave.

156
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:14.979
Anthony Taylor: and is it even any different.

157
00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:19.440
Anthony Taylor: slightly different. or

158
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.749
Anthony Taylor: both of them really but very slight?

159
00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:33.999
Anthony Taylor: Hi! And then the last thing we're gonna do is do the cross-validate. And this will be the last thing we learned yesterday. So this will be fun. We're gonna do Cv underscore scores

160
00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:37.990
Anthony Taylor: equals? We're gonna do our cross

161
00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.660
Anthony Taylor: Val score method

162
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.250
Anthony Taylor: and pass in

163
00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.140
Anthony Taylor: what model we want to use.

164
00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:50.639
Anthony Taylor: And then we're gonna pass in our training data.

165
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:56.630
Anthony Taylor: And then we're gonna pass in our our target data.

166
00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:01.790
Anthony Taylor: So it has something to train against. And we're going to tell it how we want it to score.

167
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:05.170
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

168
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:18.619
Anthony Taylor: and from that we'll pull out.  I was so tempted to just go copy and paste it, but we're not in there all scores.

169
00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:26.220
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna pat. We're gonna get seat, the the actual scores. Okay? And then

170
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.329
Anthony Taylor: we're going to do mean score.

171
00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.760
Anthony Taylor: which will be

172
00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:43.459
Anthony Taylor: very good. Every webinar. Cv, scores dot neat.

173
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:48.990
Anthony Taylor: and last, but not least. the standard deviation.

174
00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:02.209
Anthony Taylor: And and there we go.

175
00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:11.320
Anthony Taylor: So all scores, (283) 317-4045.

176
00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:12.980
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

177
00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:16.689
Anthony Taylor: good. I mean, is the model any good? No, not really.

178
00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:20.310
Anthony Taylor: It's it's so bad.

179
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.159
Anthony Taylor: You would be better just like flipping a coin to guess what the value is.

180
00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:27.240
Anthony Taylor: All right. It's that it's that good.

181
00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.380
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Any questions.

182
00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:37.619
Anthony Taylor: Alright, guys, as your brains warmed up. That's what I want to know

183
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.330
Anthony Taylor: is what I'm about to show you.

184
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.939
Anthony Taylor: It's going to break some brains.

185
00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:48.120
Anthony Taylor: pretty sure. But it's really really cool.

186
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:54.489
Anthony Taylor:  and it's it's kind of important.

187
00:17:55.480 --> 00:18:04.840
Anthony Taylor:  Here we go.

188
00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.460
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So first off, before we get started.

189
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:22.309
Anthony Taylor: walk me through the steps to get from. I have data to. I have a scored moment. So what's the first step?

190
00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.010
Mason, Natalie: Besides importing?

191
00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:39.610
Anthony Taylor: Well, that would be the first step. Well, wait. Importing python packages. Okay, no, but that's alright. We actually. But what's the first step we do with the data?

192
00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:44.899
Anthony Taylor: First thing we gotta do. What was that, Jennifer? I saw your mouth?

193
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:50.569
Anthony Taylor: Well, that's true, too. But yeah, but you have to import the data first.

194
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.360
Jennifer Dahlgren: and then you could. Yeah.

195
00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:55.590
Anthony Taylor: don't give it all away.

196
00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:59.209
Jennifer Dahlgren: That's good. That's the first step.

197
00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:01.740
Anthony Taylor: the first step load the data.

198
00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:07.559
Anthony Taylor: Okay, yeah, you have to investigate it. But we're talking. We're gonna assume those steps are in the middle.

199
00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:12.130
Anthony Taylor: What's the next programmatic step? After we load our data

200
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:15.500
Anthony Taylor: that we've learned over the last

201
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:18.520
Anthony Taylor: train train test is bleed.

202
00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:28.370
Anthony Taylor: Cindy. That is fantastic. But you jumped ahead like 2 steps. Okay. so what's the step after we load the data that we have to

203
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.239
Clayton Graves: gonna use my private day or

204
00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:44.879
Anthony Taylor: scale it, or whatever you gotta clean process. Thank you. So we're gonna do get dummies. We're gonna do scaling all of that pre-processing steps. Okay?

205
00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:46.109
Anthony Taylor: Then, what?

206
00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.070
Anthony Taylor: Now? We have standardized scale.

207
00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:55.450
Anthony Taylor: No dummies are no categorical variables. What's next?

208
00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:57.510
michael mcpherson: Great data frame

209
00:19:58.370 --> 00:19:59.949
Sihong Zhou: define X,

210
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:05.209
Anthony Taylor: create a new data point. create a new data flip.

211
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:14.699
Anthony Taylor:  okay, X, and y, that's fair. X and Y is fair. So you define X, you define y. Okay. After that.

212
00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:18.220
Anthony Taylor: Pafton.

213
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.070
Gebrekristos, Hafton: I was gonna say, Eda

214
00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:30.209
Anthony Taylor: Edi. Well, that's that's not wrong. But I'm really looking just for the steps to get us through, making them all so like the Covid steps.

215
00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:42.590
Anthony Taylor: So the Eda. Yes, you need that when you did your pre process. Okay, but we're talking right now, mostly about the the coding steps. It took us to get from load data

216
00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:47.270
Anthony Taylor: to a score. So what would be after defining X and Y and

217
00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:50.120
Anthony Taylor: standard scale and reprocessing

218
00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:55.250
Mason, Natalie: splitting the data into training. And Natalie.

219
00:20:55.320 --> 00:21:00.990
Anthony Taylor: brain test split. Okay? So we're getting there. Okay.

220
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:04.820
Anthony Taylor:  and then what.

221
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:08.580
Anthony Taylor: Cindy? This is your cue. And then what?

222
00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:13.580
Sihong Zhou: Then train the model.

223
00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:17.310
Sihong Zhou: Yeah. Chain, the model faded and a predicate

224
00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.380
Anthony Taylor: exactly right.

225
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:26.420
Anthony Taylor: And and that was perfect. That's the answer. So now we have model. We have fit in, and now we can store it.

226
00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:27.350
Anthony Taylor: Now

227
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:35.460
Anthony Taylor: I will say I'm gonna kind of add next to step, kind of been doing this, and that is trying multiple models or

228
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:44.960
Anthony Taylor: multiple variables in our model. So that's usually the last step while we're scoring. Okay? So these patterns

229
00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:49.450
Anthony Taylor: are pretty consistent on all machine learning.

230
00:21:50.450 --> 00:22:02.930
Anthony Taylor: all of it. Everything you're going to learn over the next month. Alright. but we actually have a word for it. Word, we've all used before a workflow

231
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:12.750
Anthony Taylor: or a pipeline. Okay? So the workflow defines how each phase of the project is going to work. And in which order.

232
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:16.540
Anthony Taylor: But to do this, we typically are going to create

233
00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:19.329
Anthony Taylor: a function for each step.

234
00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:22.869
Anthony Taylor: Okay, to kind of knock things out.

235
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:26.730
Anthony Taylor:  so

236
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:37.159
Anthony Taylor: alright, I'm looking to see if actually, let's see if there's anything in the slideshow there might be

237
00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:45.649
Anthony Taylor: defines. Each phase of the project unfolds, into which order, why use it?

238
00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:51.949
Anthony Taylor: Again? And and I kind of said this a lot. But you guys go really see it going forward.

239
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:58.469
Anthony Taylor: We're going to use like the exact same. just with different variables. Pretty much

240
00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:02.000
Anthony Taylor: for a while. Okay?

241
00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:10.580
Anthony Taylor:  when you're when you do something like this, if you create all of these functions and

242
00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:15.990
Anthony Taylor: make them generic enough. you can actually reuse them in a lot of stuff.

243
00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:28.499
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Which means you can have like this little utility file which I'm going to give you today that you could reuse for other other Ml, engineering tasks.

244
00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:32.709
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And yeah, it might take a little longer to build it.

245
00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.510
Anthony Taylor: but the just the fact that you have it.

246
00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:45.380
Anthony Taylor: And now I can go. You know what. Let's try that with this with Velasso instead of linear regression. Let's try it with Ridge instead of lasso.

247
00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:50.620
Anthony Taylor: And you just do like change like one variable. And then everything runs.

248
00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:55.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's the goal. That's what we're gonna get to

249
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:59.280
Anthony Taylor: to that. So we already answered this question.

250
00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:03.819
Anthony Taylor: loading, splitting, finding and selecting features

251
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:15.280
Anthony Taylor: training and scoring and trying multiple models. Okay? Which situations might benefit from being able to train multiple models at the same time. Right

252
00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:18.249
Anthony Taylor: truth be known. Botcho.

253
00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:29.299
Anthony Taylor: So training and forecasting sales from multiple stores instead of one awesome training to predict the payroll of a company instead of train one model per department and combine the predictions

254
00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:30.560
Anthony Taylor: also possible

255
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:36.770
Anthony Taylor: training. Individual models predict whether in states instead, use a workflow to train all of them.

256
00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:50.600
Anthony Taylor: You can basically create a loop. run the workflow for every single state you're done. If you didn't have a work flow, you'd have to build out this huge giant notebook every time.

257
00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so

258
00:24:58.030 --> 00:24:59.979
Anthony Taylor: the way this works

259
00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.380
Anthony Taylor: is, we're gonna have.

260
00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:05.800
Anthony Taylor:  hmm.

261
00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.230
Anthony Taylor: okay. So

262
00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:21.620
Anthony Taylor: they're using this odd terminology. It's the right terminology. But it's not necessary here. So basically, we're gonna have a pipeline. And in that pipeline we're gonna have a list of functions that we're gonna call.

263
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:24.270
Anthony Taylor: And it's gonna run each of those functions.

264
00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:30.570
Anthony Taylor: But we're gonna fit it to the data. So once we create this pipeline.

265
00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:32.829
Anthony Taylor: see if they show it.

266
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.529
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So

267
00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:38.819
Anthony Taylor: we have. Here's the steps we want to do in the pipeline.

268
00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:44.179
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna do one high coding standard scalar run a linear regression model. That's it.

269
00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:45.900
Anthony Taylor: 3 steps.

270
00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:50.600
Anthony Taylor: You create it. Using this pipeline method

271
00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:57.100
Anthony Taylor: and that gives it the step. Then you take that pipeline and say, Okay. train it

272
00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:59.369
Anthony Taylor: with this data.

273
00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:06.139
Anthony Taylor: What does it do? It's gonna run one hiding, coding. It's gonna run standard scalar and fit it.

274
00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.569
Anthony Taylor: And it's going to run linear regression and train it.

275
00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:14.249
Anthony Taylor: So it's going to do all those steps in one call

276
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:17.400
Anthony Taylor: pretty cool. Right? Yeah, Mike.

277
00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:24.930
Anthony Taylor: you're muted

278
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:32.510
michael mcpherson: sorry. Do you have to secondary step? Write out those

279
00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:41.019
Anthony Taylor: those functions one hot encoder? Well, some of them. Yes, some of them. No, I will. And I'm gonna show you that just a minute.

280
00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:47.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're gonna write out functions to do a whole bunch of stuff. And yes, you can set them in

281
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:50.899
Anthony Taylor: alright. yeah, you'll see that.

282
00:26:51.470 --> 00:27:03.589
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But they the only thing that's kind of interesting here is this in in the training step. It's actually gonna attempt to train all of these like one out of coders to acquire train.

283
00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but it's gonna attempt to do it. When you run this.

284
00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:12.550
Anthony Taylor: not gonna hurt anything, it's just it's just what it does. Okay.

285
00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:20.539
Anthony Taylor: alright. And then at the end, we can say, pipeline, that same pipeline as before. Give us our predictions.

286
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:27.670
Anthony Taylor: Alright, that's pretty cool. Okay.  So

287
00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.689
Anthony Taylor: hang here with me for a second notice. We have

288
00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:39.170
Anthony Taylor: a python file in our solution to it.

289
00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:44.449
Anthony Taylor: Not just Nope. okay. we do have a new.

290
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:48.749
Anthony Taylor: But when everybody go to the pipeline utilities first

291
00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:56.020
Anthony Taylor: in this notebook. now II will tell you what I don't like about what they did. Here

292
00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:59.029
Anthony Taylor: is a lot of this is really good.

293
00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:03.480
Anthony Taylor: The problem that I don't like is, they made it specific to rent.

294
00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:09.470
Anthony Taylor: So if you guys decide, you want to use these later, not today.

295
00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:13.520
Anthony Taylor: you should go through this and figure out well.

296
00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.740
Anthony Taylor: if we removed rent.

297
00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:18.870
Anthony Taylor: because none of this talks about

298
00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:28.930
Anthony Taylor: well, it does have price in there. So you could go through this and rewrite this to pass in any data frame

299
00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:32.620
Anthony Taylor: and any

300
00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:34.520
Anthony Taylor: target column.

301
00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:38.469
Anthony Taylor: And then this function would still work.

302
00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.010
Anthony Taylor: Okay, not to worry about that. Today.

303
00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:45.059
Anthony Taylor: This function was written specifically for the data frame. We're going to pass it.

304
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:49.039
Anthony Taylor: And just take a look, how many rows are there?

305
00:28:50.250 --> 00:29:02.100
Anthony Taylor: Dude? We're gonna drop in a we're gonna get how many rows are left? Okay? Then we're going to see how many of them are null. So what percentage of the rows were null. Then we're going to print.

306
00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.870
Anthony Taylor: We dropped this many growth.

307
00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:13.899
Anthony Taylor: Then we're gonna create our X and our Y, we're gonna return our train tests with

308
00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:19.010
Anthony Taylor: for X and y. so 4 variables make sense.

309
00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:25.940
Anthony Taylor: Everybody follow what we did there? We did a whole bunch of preprocessing one function.

310
00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:30.600
Anthony Taylor: Am I comfortable with that before I move on to the next.

311
00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:33.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

312
00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.780
Anthony Taylor: now, we're gonna do a little more preprocessing.

313
00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:44.550
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're gonna split in the training and testing sets and use prices. The target. So here they're just dropping price.

314
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.860
Anthony Taylor: creating X and Y and doing a train test split.

315
00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:52.999
Anthony Taylor: This is just another function. This one does a lot more. This one does a lot less.

316
00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:56.729
Anthony Taylor: Basically, this gets rid of those tells you how many.

317
00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:01.329
Anthony Taylor: So if you look, this whole section that is added to this

318
00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:04.510
Anthony Taylor: is just dealing with the nulls

319
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:09.990
Anthony Taylor: in this function. We're we're like, we're gonna keep the nose. We're fine.

320
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.589
Anthony Taylor: Yes, dear.

321
00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:20.790
Anthony Taylor: muted. So your return train test split. So I mean, you have to

322
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:30.569
Derek Rikke: like, define X train and X test and Y, you would totally do that function. Yes, you would totally do.

323
00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:36.729
Anthony Taylor: Yes, I know, John.

324
00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:46.109
Anthony Taylor: I'm I'm actually typing this all out for a reason, I promise equals pre processed

325
00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:54.900
Anthony Taylor: underscore rents. underscore data. And then you'd pass it in the data frame.

326
00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:09.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then that's gonna return the result of this function. And that would be all for those variables. You'll see that in just a second and good question.

327
00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:18.850
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So this one, we're handling those this one. We're gonna keep the nose lots. Simple.

328
00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:30.470
Anthony Taylor: R, 2 adjusted. We've been doing this one for a couple of days, the same R, 2 adjusted. There's nothing fancy about that check metrics. So here we're going to take our predicted data.

329
00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:34.980
Anthony Taylor: and we're going to print out. MSER. Squared and adjusted R squared.

330
00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.270
Anthony Taylor: It's all that function does.

331
00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:43.729
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Well, actually, we're gonna print them out. But we're gonna return, adjust.

332
00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:50.630
Anthony Taylor: get best pipelines. So this one's kind of interesting. So

333
00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:54.809
Anthony Taylor: assuming we do more than one pipeline.

334
00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:58.479
Anthony Taylor: So a pipeline one and a pipeline 2.

335
00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:05.070
Anthony Taylor: We're going to take this data. We're going to run the preprocessing step.

336
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:12.180
Anthony Taylor: We're going to do the pipeline that we passed in. And

337
00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:21.200
Anthony Taylor: we're going to check the metrics. Okay? So this one tested it. Dropping the in a

338
00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:31.859
Anthony Taylor: this one, we're going to keep DNA. So we're gonna do the same thing. But then then we're gonna keep DNA's. We're gonna use pipeline, too.

339
00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:36.530
and return the adjusted

340
00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:42.940
Anthony Taylor: r, 2. If and all this says. yeah.

341
00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:50.689
Anthony Taylor: P. 2 adjusted R, 2 is greater than P. One adjusted. R, 2. Return B, 2.

342
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:57.670
Anthony Taylor: Otherwise return the first just checking to see which one's better. That's it.

343
00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:01.650
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So that's what that function does

344
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:02.940
Anthony Taylor: questions.

345
00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:09.440
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're gonna see them all in work in a minute. I just wanted to go through these first.

346
00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:14.179
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so this is the cool one. So this

347
00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:21.529
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna pass in just the data frame. we're going to create a list of steps we want to execute.

348
00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:27.699
Anthony Taylor: This is basically what we just talked about. Right? This is the pipeline.

349
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:37.050
Anthony Taylor: We're going to initialize the pipeline for one and for 2 exactly the same stuff.

350
00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:43.659
Anthony Taylor: Pipeline equals get best pipeline. We're going to pass these both in

351
00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:54.429
Anthony Taylor: and we're gonna return the pipeline that comes back from this function. So we go backwards from here. I'm not going to go all the way through it. But let's just quickly talk about.

352
00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:56.670
Anthony Taylor: So this

353
00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:03.259
Anthony Taylor: is going to execute this which is going to execute

354
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:07.490
Anthony Taylor: this right here.

355
00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:16.190
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then, when it's done executing that it's going to do check metrics.

356
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:21.850
Anthony Taylor: this one which, just for the record, executes this one.

357
00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:27.199
Anthony Taylor: Now, this might be the best

358
00:34:28.219 --> 00:34:31.800
Anthony Taylor: example of a python

359
00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:35.209
Anthony Taylor: program that you guys have seen so far.

360
00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.480
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

361
00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:40.750
Anthony Taylor: so when you run this.

362
00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:46.260
Anthony Taylor: there's really not anything you need to do it says this script should not be run directly.

363
00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:50.350
Anthony Taylor: So what are we gonna do with this? We're gonna go to our

364
00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.080
Anthony Taylor: notebook

365
00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:58.180
Anthony Taylor: and we're gonna import 2 data sets, Texas, California.

366
00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:02.290
Anthony Taylor: Okay? I did not pick those.

367
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:03.619
Anthony Taylor: This is for the record.

368
00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:06.810
Anthony Taylor: Then we're gonna take a peek

369
00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:12.159
Anthony Taylor: boy. Is that free? Okay, we're gonna take a peek at this one.

370
00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:16.190
Anthony Taylor: Oh, wait. Well, I peaked at one up. Yep, okay.

371
00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:20.520
Anthony Taylor: and then we're gonna import. What is this?

372
00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:25.580
Anthony Taylor: What library is that? That?

373
00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:40.060
Anthony Taylor: What library? That that's the python script that we just went over. I love that good job like. So yes, we're importing this. Okay, that's all we're doing is importing this, and we're calling it

374
00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:41.410
Anthony Taylor: key utils.

375
00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:45.929
Anthony Taylor: So now we can call Texas.

376
00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:50.300
Anthony Taylor: He utils rent, model, generate. What's it going to do.

377
00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:55.739
Anthony Taylor: going to run this function down here at the bottom. which is going to do a pipeline.

378
00:35:56.230 --> 00:36:02.139
Anthony Taylor: It's going to get the best pipeline which is going to run all that other stuff and then return the final

379
00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:06.270
Anthony Taylor: pipeline quick question. So that's yes.

380
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.430
Dipinto, Matt: Can can you go back to the utilities?

381
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:20.179
Dipinto, Matt: Sure. So I guess what I'm not understanding here is it's putting the same steps into both of those pipelines. So aren't they? Therefore the identical pipeline

382
00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:25.380
Anthony Taylor: they would be, except when they call this, get best pipeline

383
00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:35.580
Dipinto, Matt: for pipeline one first pipeline once, not dropping at once.

384
00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:49.249
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So so we're going to pass the Texas data in. It's going to tell us everything. You dropped 74% of the road mean squared error, 43 r squared, 31 adjust

385
00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:50.580
Anthony Taylor: testing

386
00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:53.639
Anthony Taylor: with the notes 33%,

387
00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.270
Anthony Taylor: 30%.

388
00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:58.620
Anthony Taylor: It returned the dropped in a S cause. That was better.

389
00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:03.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's pretty damn cool.

390
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:06.550
Anthony Taylor: We could do the same thing with California.

391
00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:10.230
Anthony Taylor: dropped 83% of the roads.

392
00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:15.000
Anthony Taylor: 18%. Wow, that's really bad.

393
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:21.610
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so it returned, the no dropped again because it wasn't as bad as the other.

394
00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:30.000
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Now, biggest problem I have with this one. The drop in a thing is dumb. In this data we have 22 columns.

395
00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:41.390
Anthony Taylor: the odds of at least one of these columns being dull is very high. Okay? But that's alright. That's something easy to fix. Okay, what you're supposed to get from all of this

396
00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:44.890
Anthony Taylor: is how awesome it is that now we could take

397
00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:47.940
Anthony Taylor: this data frame from any state

398
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:52.709
Anthony Taylor: or city, if it's the same structure, more or less.

399
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:59.030
Anthony Taylor: and we could pump it through just this one thing, and you get all of this information

400
00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:02.259
Anthony Taylor: pretty cool. Huh?

401
00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:12.579
Anthony Taylor: That's the purpose of the pipeline. Now I know this was a lot. But I want you guys to look at it and realize that while it's very verbose

402
00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:14.500
Anthony Taylor: like me.

403
00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:19.089
Anthony Taylor: Okay. it's all stuff. You've done

404
00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:28.789
Anthony Taylor: everything in here. You guys have done. You've just done it like one cell at a time. We're basically just taking those cells and putting them into functions.

405
00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:33.180
Anthony Taylor: Got it pretty exciting.

406
00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.819
Anthony Taylor: Alright, any questions.

407
00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:47.470
Anthony Taylor: Huh? That's fair.

408
00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:52.790
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

409
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:56.440
Anthony Taylor: Part 3.

410
00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:04.139
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna be honest with you guys. I'll say this on the recording

411
00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:16.569
Anthony Taylor: in my history of teaching these courses 9 cohorts with you guys. I have never once honored a mini project. I find them to be late.

412
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:20.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but I'm going to say this.

413
00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:23.490
Anthony Taylor: I wanna try it out

414
00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:28.979
Anthony Taylor: because they at least gave you a limited amount of data.

415
00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:39.680
Anthony Taylor: So it's not as hard as like in the past. Many projects were, have the students go find some data, create a linear regression project and tell. But tell you about what they did.

416
00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:52.350
Anthony Taylor: Okay. that was crazy. This one. We're going to give you 3 data sets. You may pick one of these data sets and then you simply do the project. It's pretty much

417
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:56.510
Anthony Taylor: exactly what we've been talking about all week. Okay.

418
00:39:56.700 --> 00:40:05.159
Anthony Taylor:  it's it keeps talking about an application. So what it's kind of talking about. It would love for you to try this.

419
00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:11.870
Anthony Taylor: and you do have a lot of time to do so. You can try this. I will tell you. Here's my thought of.

420
00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:20.959
Anthony Taylor: oh, that sucks. I just realized that we have a group that almost the entire group is.

421
00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:28.349
Anthony Taylor: huh? Okay?

422
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:34.960
Anthony Taylor: so yeah. So so you're just gonna knock it out. It's it's not tough.

423
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:37.080
Anthony Taylor: But you're gonna have fun with.

424
00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:44.750
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so you're gonna work in small groups. You're gonna explore some data set. You're gonna pre-process. The data, select the model linear regression

425
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:50.829
Anthony Taylor: and incorporate a machine learning pipeline before returning. You guys back to here.

426
00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:56.709
Anthony Taylor: And then you're going to explain how it went. We're not going to do

427
00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:59.220
Anthony Taylor: like. Oh, I need a slide show. No.

428
00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:12.840
Anthony Taylor: they're gonna come back. Gonna ask a couple of you to tell us how it went. That's the end of the day. Happy weekend. Okay. But you're gonna be doing this till let's say

429
00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:15.220
Anthony Taylor: 9, 10.

430
00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:28.740
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, we'll give 20 min to go over. Okay, so that's that's only an hour. That's not right. Yeah, no, that's right. It's 7, 11 right now. Right? Okay, sorry. Get my time zone fixed up

431
00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:31.469
Anthony Taylor: so 2 h to do this.

432
00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:33.489
Anthony Taylor: Here's what I was thinking.

433
00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:38.730
Anthony Taylor: I'm just gonna let you guys go back into your groups that you were in for project. What?

434
00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:40.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

435
00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:46.150
Anthony Taylor:  yeah.

436
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:49.840
Anthony Taylor: Does anybody.

437
00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:55.790
Anthony Taylor: Does anybody have an objection that everybody? Okay with objects to call? Tell? Tell me later.

438
00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:57.609
Anthony Taylor: okay, I cool?

439
00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:02.130
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So I'm going to set up the rooms.

440
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:11.200
Anthony Taylor: We do just like we did for project. I think Curry said he had an objection.

441
00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:18.259
Anthony Taylor: Curry's fired. You don't get to object. Curry.

442
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:20.399
michael mcpherson: Yeah, you love our group.

443
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:22.000
Mason, Natalie: I do.

444
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.930
There.

445
00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:24.940
Anthony Taylor: Dang, man.

446
00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:28.530
Masarirambi, Rodney: you got you to feel that bus coming first.

447
00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:30.480
Anthony Taylor: you know.

448
00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:34.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you come with us. You come with us.

449
00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:43.030
Anthony Taylor: II will say here, if any of you guys for this, I don't care if you guys work a group or work together. Just decide at the beginning.

450
00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:45.570
Anthony Taylor: You're gonna work together, or you're gonna work separately.

451
00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:52.749
Anthony Taylor: It's not easy. So I mean, I think doing it as a group will probably benefit you.

452
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:59.800
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but you guys can decide when you get into your group rooms. I will have some extra rooms in here.

453
00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:04.949
Anthony Taylor: So if you guys decide, somebody wants to do it themselves, whatever.

454
00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:18.630
Anthony Taylor: Okay. you feel free. But anyway, I will see you guys back here at 10 after 9.

455
00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:22.020
Anthony Taylor: Does that sound right to you guys? Yeah, 2 h from now

456
00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:26.600
Anthony Taylor: over here, I'll put a timer on. I could do that. I could do 120 min.

457
00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:29.840
Anthony Taylor: There we go. Hi, Gay.

458
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:40.540
Anthony Taylor: have fun with this. Call us if you need us, get us up in slack, whatever. Alright pretty set. Go. Oh, sleeping on the job. Yeah.

459
00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:44.039
Anthony Taylor: I'm not gonna sleep anymore. I'm gonna sit here and go like this

460
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:48.169
Anthony Taylor: and like drool.

461
00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.760
Anthony Taylor: Anyway.

462
00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:55.890
Anthony Taylor: yeah, go to your rooms. They're open. I didn't send you to them. Go to your room.

463
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:58.510
Anthony Taylor: your brows.

464
00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:01.319
Mason, Natalie: We're Number 4,

465
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.479
Masarirambi, Rodney: Clayton. We need it. Say it. Say the words, Clayton.

466
00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:09.579
Anthony Taylor: He's already there. It says he's my X-men

467
00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:13.390
Masarirambi, Rodney: who it says to me, My ex man, X men is simple.

468
00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:16.890
Clayton Graves: Okay, that's

469
00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:27.689
Clayton Graves: we saw the solution. And we said, Okay, that's cheating. And we decided to pick a different topic. And we did the the popularity of and the news popularity one

470
00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:35.400
Clayton Graves: and basically, what we did was we took the solution and we used it as a guide

471
00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:49.439
Clayton Graves: for picking the the data points. And at the very beginning where it's where you're picking days. We pick sources instead. And Derek went into the

472
00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:56.709
Clayton Graves: the pipeline and changed out where the columns were hard coded

473
00:44:57.110 --> 00:45:03.600
Clayton Graves: in. The original solution change those out to target column

474
00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:06.770
Clayton Graves: is created a variable called target column.

475
00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:19.639
Clayton Graves: So that when you are calling the data you're calling the pipeline for the data you specify the data frame and the column you want to use.

476
00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:23.680
Clayton Graves: and it will pass it into the pipeline and run the data.

477
00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:28.740
Clayton Graves: That's that's the excellent.

478
00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:37.669
Anthony Taylor: Now, that is what I mentioned some of the other ones to do, too. So did any of the other groups do something like this. Mike's group. Did I know that

479
00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:43.340
Anthony Taylor: Gabe and Halfton? Did you guys, Tanya.

480
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:46.479
Anthony Taylor: did you guys do this? Something like that

481
00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:54.969
Anthony Taylor: they were the first ones to point out that that the solution was there. By the way, they were the most honest of the group.

482
00:45:56.130 --> 00:46:01.129
Gebrekristos, Hafton: Yeah, we added a common as a parameter to one of the functions.

483
00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:06.159
Gebrekristos, Hafton: And we were. We were also working not dropping na.

484
00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:13.680
Gebrekristos, Hafton: computing, na like. But we're trying to.

485
00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:19.140
Gebrekristos, Hafton: We were trying to look through all the columns that has missing values.

486
00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:23.249
Gebrekristos, Hafton: and calculate either average or median and then replace it.

487
00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:27.950
Anthony Taylor: Well, there's a whole bunch of stuff on dealing with missing values.

488
00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:36.760
Raugewitz, Tania: Well, yeah, so we just what we did was identify the column that had it so

489
00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:45.120
Raugewitz, Tania: that we could at least see which column was giving us the issue, and then decide what to do with it, if

490
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:51.769
Raugewitz, Tania: like. In this case, there was roughly 50 was 0. So we didn't necessarily want to put in by default

491
00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:56.820
Raugewitz, Tania: the the median or the mean but because

492
00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:07.360
Raugewitz, Tania: time limitation we just put that in there? No, but that's good. That's an excellent, excellent direction. Did anybody else go weird direction

493
00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:09.630
Anthony Taylor: or do something different?

494
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:28.699
Jennifer Dahlgren: I was gonna say that Brandon was a Brainchild for us. And he did very similar things and found code that allowed us to do mean imputation. So so, yeah. And then we got to talk about is that really good? Should we do it? And so so yeah, he he was. He was pretty awesome.

495
00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:31.990
Jennifer Dahlgren: We decided to do it because it was more fun.

496
00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:36.680
Raugewitz, Tania: It is definitely more fun. And like, I said, there is

497
00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:40.330
Anthony Taylor: a lot of of of

498
00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:42.970
Anthony Taylor: missing value

499
00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:46.950
Anthony Taylor: techniques. Okay, main invitation is a great one

500
00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:51.159
Anthony Taylor: there's there's there's a stick, there's quite a few, and the some of them are actually

501
00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:57.020
Anthony Taylor: like other models that you run on the data and train them

502
00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:09.290
Anthony Taylor: to come up with the best option to fill a blank. So but anyway, that's great. That's really good. I'm really I didn't. I think anybody would try that. That's pretty, Dugdon. Impressive. Nice work, Brando.

503
00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:13.240
Anthony Taylor: and for sorry

504
00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:15.839
Anthony Taylor: by his name's Jennifer, said Jenny.

505
00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:24.330
Anthony Taylor:  alright. So

506
00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:28.300
Anthony Taylor: great work regression check

507
00:48:28.810 --> 00:48:31.950
Anthony Taylor: alright. Next week we start

508
00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:41.729
Anthony Taylor: supervise, which is where we're gonna really get into heavy classification stuff. To me it's probably the most fun one

509
00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:44.520
Anthony Taylor: of all of them.

510
00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:51.310
Anthony Taylor:  yeah. And you know, just just just

511
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:54.660
Anthony Taylor: we're 3 weeks away from Project 2 gang

512
00:48:56.420 --> 00:49:05.859
Anthony Taylor: yeah, crazy. So we have classification next week. Then we're gonna talk about optimization of all these models. Super important.

513
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:21.909
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna have a week of data ethics which I'm trying to get that changed.  don't get me wrong. Data. Ethics are important. That's probably the one week I'm gonna understand. And you're trying to get rid of it.

514
00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:27.580
Anthony Taylor: I it's one of those things where

515
00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:35.150
Anthony Taylor: it's great. And we could. But but okay, so in the data science course.

516
00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:38.980
Anthony Taylor: literally the course where we teach this stuff.

517
00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:43.100
Anthony Taylor: we spend like 2 h on data ethics.

518
00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:50.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And they have somehow stretched that 2 h into a week. So that's my problem.

519
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:58.520
Anthony Taylor: And actually looking at it, they have lots of great examples. It may not be terrible. We may just do it, and and we'll do it.

520
00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:08.199
Anthony Taylor: But I just I keep thinking there's got to be something better we could do with that time. But some of you might be like, hey ethics. That's something we need to know about. So

521
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:09.550
Anthony Taylor: we're okay.

522
00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:18.639
Mason, Natalie: We could just spend time working on my AI application that I'm trying to build.

523
00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:22.360
michael mcpherson: I'm doing one, too.

524
00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:28.989
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, Mike's working on one.

525
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:32.119
Mason, Natalie: Yeah, for what? For? So schools.

526
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:38.780
Anthony Taylor: yes, for schools. Okay, hold on, hold on. Let's just wrap it up. And then we can talk about those. So

527
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:47.460
Anthony Taylor: classification next class super excited starts on Monday. No challenge for this one we just finished.

528
00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:50.560
Anthony Taylor: So if you're not caught up, catch up.

529
00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:52.690
Anthony Taylor: have a great weekend.

530
00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:54.870
Anthony Taylor: See ya.
