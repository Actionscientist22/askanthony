1
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.220
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

2
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.059
Anthony Taylor: So bar charts. Right? So now we're on bar charts.

3
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.560
Anthony Taylor: So

4
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.940
Anthony Taylor: Clayton, part 2,

5
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.949
Anthony Taylor: II Mpl.

6
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.170
hmm.

7
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.490
Anthony Taylor: not everybody came back yet

8
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:48.410
Anthony Taylor: I am truly sorry that I ended the meeting one last time. That was an accident. Okay, so map. Now, we're gonna do bar charts. So here.

9
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.300
Anthony Taylor: keeping in mind that the X-axis is simply a label.

10
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.429
Anthony Taylor: Okay, the the data values are going to rise

11
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.549
Anthony Taylor: from that label

12
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.630
Anthony Taylor: alright. The good news is

13
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.930
Anthony Taylor: instead of dot plot.

14
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.800
Anthony Taylor: Right? You're gonna put bar.

15
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.580
Anthony Taylor: That's it.

16
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.160
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you need to pass in the X axes.

17
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:26.339
Anthony Taylor: which in this case is just going to be some number values the values that you want to rise from each one in the order at which they're gonna they're going in there.

18
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.910
Anthony Taylor: The color of the bar.

19
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.369
Anthony Taylor: the alpha, so like an alpha again, is, how transparent it is!

20
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.890
Anthony Taylor: Alright. And this alignment is where the tick

21
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.870
Anthony Taylor: under the bar

22
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.350
Anthony Taylor: sits. So if we run this

23
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.329
Anthony Taylor: because we said aligned center is right in the middle of the bar.

24
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.820
Anthony Taylor: You might want it on the left side. You might want it on the right side. But this is right in the middle of the ball.

25
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.190
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

26
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.730
Anthony Taylor: so bars very similar to your regular plots. Just

27
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.240
Anthony Taylor: dot bar instead of that bar.

28
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.919
Anthony Taylor: Now, here's where Bar gets a little more interesting.

29
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:17.750
Anthony Taylor: This is not very informative, is it? 0 1, 2, 3, 4. So we want to put values like, so.

30
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.270
Anthony Taylor: okay, so what we can do. And and you is, you get

31
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.680
Anthony Taylor: the tick locations is basically these numbers.

32
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.189
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So this is a really simple one. So the numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. But

33
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.730
Anthony Taylor: okay. the tick location. So, but that's not always the case.

34
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.399
Anthony Taylor: All right. You might have an X that has all kinds of different things.

35
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:55.850
Anthony Taylor:  so you use this, or you can do a for loop, whichever you prefer, and this will give you a list

36
00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.550
Anthony Taylor: of values that correspond to your ex axis.

37
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:08.380
Anthony Taylor: Then you run X ticks. give it that list of value.

38
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.479
Anthony Taylor: and then tell it what place each one. And again, this is in order.

39
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.019
Anthony Taylor: So Java will replace 0 c plus plus 1, 5, 2 ruby, 3. Close your pool.

40
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.279
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then you can show it, and you'll have

41
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.360
Anthony Taylor: pick marks

42
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.650
Anthony Taylor: account. Okay?

43
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.850
Anthony Taylor: So now you get the cool tick marks for each bar. So the actual leaders.

44
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.090
Anthony Taylor: alright.

45
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:59.140
Anthony Taylor: again, we can do, Xlim, because this is still just. A map plotlid plot. So Xlim applies to everything. I do want you guys to notice we're starting to add some mathematics to it

46
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.180
Anthony Taylor: instead of just, you know, like, earlier, we were saying 0 to 10 negative 1 one, because we could see

47
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.650
Anthony Taylor: that was the values that were there.

48
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:13.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But in this case we're like, well, X,

49
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.580
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna start, you know, we're gonna do this. And then why we want to go up to the top.

50
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.549
Anthony Taylor: and then maybe subtract a little bit.

51
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.369
Anthony Taylor: But you know, so this gives us a way to dynamically

52
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.180
Anthony Taylor: do the the same thing. Sorry, this is just X. So we're starting at 0 point 7 5 and going

53
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.610
Anthony Taylor: all the way over to just slightly less than what it is. Now I'm gonna run it again and say.

54
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:44.790
Anthony Taylor: and then for y, we're doing the verdict. You're starting at 0 point 7 5 negative. And you're going

55
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.180
Anthony Taylor: in this case, the Max. whatever this value means, plus

56
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.299
Anthony Taylor: 5,000.

57
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.660
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so

58
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.310
Anthony Taylor: get that to run again.

59
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.370
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So we go from that. And now we have a little bit cleaner

60
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:11.580
Anthony Taylor: output. I ran off so last, but not least, you're make your chart as aesthetically pleasing as possible.

61
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.109
Anthony Taylor: Add your title, your labels, and that's the end of it.

62
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.960
Anthony Taylor: So all of this can be done in one cell. Just so we're clear on this.

63
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.040
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you can create it.

64
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:31.840
Anthony Taylor: Do your tick locations. your excellent Ylm. And your titles. One cell show at the end, and you're done.

65
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.280
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

66
00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.580
Anthony Taylor: alright.

67
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.419
Anthony Taylor: So for the next

68
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.140
Anthony Taylor: a

69
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.169
Anthony Taylor:  I was hoping we had a little extra, but we don't.

70
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.899
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So for this one you will get

71
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.750
Anthony Taylor: 12Â min. Brian. and

72
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.180
Anthony Taylor: knock it out.

73
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:24.090
Anthony Taylor: It's should be fairly similar to what I just showed you. Okay. they've given. They're giving you the except in this one. They're even giving you the labels and the value.

74
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.140
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So

75
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:33.420
Anthony Taylor: really, a lot of this is just going to be. Get your ticks, so follow the example. Set your limits.

76
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.280
Anthony Taylor: give your your title and your labels, and save

77
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.200
Anthony Taylor: right awesome

78
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.590
Anthony Taylor: welcome back. So how do we do we get through it? That one was

79
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:54.220
Clayton Graves: probably tougher than some of the other ones. Actually, the the tick stuff was a little tricky, but we got it figured out.

80
00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.750
Clayton Graves: and we didn't further than that. But we did get it

81
00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.510
Anthony Taylor: actually.

82
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:10.810
Anthony Taylor: everything in here, because plot bar is so similar to the other one. The X ticks was probably the most important thing to pick up in this one. because it's the only thing that's like totally different.

83
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.650
Anthony Taylor: Then the line chart one. So once you have this

84
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:20.199
Anthony Taylor: figured out, then this other stuff, you know, is is going to be the same all the time.

85
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.590
Anthony Taylor: Alright, let me talk through that real quick. So you have your values.

86
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:33.860
Anthony Taylor: You have your city. Okay, we're just doing plucked up our X and values. We're doing color blue, align center. Alright.

87
00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:40.959
Anthony Taylor: For tick locations. We did our list comprehension, or you could have used a for loop. And we passed in

88
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:42.660
Anthony Taylor: this list of cities.

89
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:49.630
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so this is often in this situation, how you might be presented with the data.

90
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:56.390
Anthony Taylor: Okay, is in either 2 arrays or even series.

91
00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:01.719
Anthony Taylor:  so that's often how that will get presented to

92
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.779
Anthony Taylor: the X-lim and wiling.

93
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:13.020
Anthony Taylor: It's just like that. It's just here to kind of clean up. Make this look a little nicer. This one doesn't actually look too bad nicely

94
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.370
Anthony Taylor: laid out.

95
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.840
Anthony Taylor: But I mean, you can see. Okay.

96
00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.980
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. I don't really think that changed that much at all. But

97
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.730
Anthony Taylor: yeah. anyway.

98
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:32.279
Anthony Taylor: And then you have your title, your label, your Y label. So the bottom line there is on configuring.

99
00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:46.450
Anthony Taylor: There's whole books written on how to make visualizations as aesthetically pleasing as possible. Okay, for what we're using visualizations for cause. Remember

100
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:54.279
Anthony Taylor: our deal with machine learning. And AI, we're learn using them more for ourselves or for our peers.

101
00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.599
Anthony Taylor: If you're gonna do it for management.

102
00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:08.309
Anthony Taylor: It's good to make it look as nice as possible, but you know they're gonna value much more for your ability to analyze this and all of that than they are to do. Dashboard.

103
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.210
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's a different group of people. Yeah, there

104
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.660
Derek Rikke: for the X ticks.

105
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.390
Derek Rikke: Can you just go X-axis

106
00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:25.630
Derek Rikke: instead of doing the tick. I don't know when you do the tick locations. Are you just getting X-axis again?

107
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.770
Anthony Taylor: A 100%. Yes. in this case.

108
00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:38.580
Anthony Taylor: okay, but not all, if there's values there, or something, you need to let it come up with those values. Because, yeah, it's just that's just how it works.

109
00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:50.510
Anthony Taylor: right? That that the reason we show you this is because it's not always going to be as simple as 0 1 2 people. It could be almost anything

110
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:56.430
Anthony Taylor: alright. So since we don't know you do this, you're for sure. Gonna get the right thing in the right place.

111
00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.480
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Any questions.

112
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:03.370
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

113
00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:11.730
Anthony Taylor: So last one, we're gonna learn today. And you guys are gonna have it. Ask a question on that. Please stick locations thing. Can you go back to?

114
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.209
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, hold on

115
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:14.380
kind of

116
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.499
Anthony Taylor: type in before I lose it. Okay.

117
00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:23.300
Dipinto, Matt: so is that not effectively just recreating the X Axis list.

118
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:37.689
Anthony Taylor:  because effective, because it's exactly the one to one transposal of it. Yeah, yeah, 100% for X equals X and X axis print X, that's basically what it is.

119
00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.829
Dipinto, Matt: So again, this is something that we always

120
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:48.039
Anthony Taylor: explain that you might have situations where you might need to do more with it. Okay, so, but I'm with you. I agree

121
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:52.769
Anthony Taylor: 100% that you could probably just leave that out. But

122
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:57.400
Anthony Taylor: X-axis here, and you'll be fine. Okay, especially with these really simple.

123
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:02.870
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Right? Now, that's a great observation. Thank you.

124
00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.750
Anthony Taylor: All right, scatterplot. So

125
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.620
Anthony Taylor: scatterplots

126
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.760
same imports.

127
00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:21.260
Anthony Taylor: Remember the biggest difference between a scatterplot, a bar chart and line chart is a scatterplot at at

128
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:22.510
Anthony Taylor: values.

129
00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:31.589
Anthony Taylor: It's not a label and a value. It's too value. So we're going to do an X limit of a hundred. We're going to grab

130
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.900
Anthony Taylor: 0 to a hundred.

131
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:39.560
Anthony Taylor: and then we're going to grab a random value for each of these values.

132
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.260
Anthony Taylor: Alright, does everybody see how that's working? We're saying, give me a hundred.

133
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:53.369
Anthony Taylor: So Npa, range 0 to a hundred. And then here we're saying for each value in here.

134
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.710
Anthony Taylor: give me a random number.

135
00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:02.360
Anthony Taylor: Okay. now. plt.

136
00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:06.199
Anthony Taylor: there it is, gather not bar, not plot.

137
00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:12.150
Anthony Taylor: scatter. pass in X passen y way, you want your markers.

138
00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:16.049
Anthony Taylor: They're normally when we teach this, we don't actually show.

139
00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:18.760
Anthony Taylor: Like all of this extra stuff. First.

140
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:25.330
Anthony Taylor: okay, we just say you can make it with just these actually, just these 2 valid.

141
00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:26.630
Anthony Taylor: And that's it.

142
00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.709
Anthony Taylor: So all the rest of this is to make it prettier

143
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:35.389
Anthony Taylor: markers. This is going to make little. So little circle. face, color.

144
00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:40.930
Anthony Taylor: the face, color, and the edge color. It's just like you might well, you know. Let me show.

145
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:48.549
Anthony Taylor: So the face color is this inside the circle. the edge color. the edge of the circle.

146
00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:56.740
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Now cool thing about scatterplots is you can have

147
00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:58.360
third

148
00:12:58.620 --> 00:12:59.560
Anthony Taylor: value.

149
00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:02.060
Anthony Taylor: which is side

150
00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:10.490
Anthony Taylor: so S equals. In this case they made it the same as the X axis. So as it moves across the screen, they get bigger and bigger and bigger.

151
00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:13.510
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but you could have.

152
00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:17.230
Anthony Taylor: you know, an X-axis, a Y axis, and then a side

153
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:23.650
Anthony Taylor: and be honest. You could actually put values into the colors as well.

154
00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:30.770
Anthony Taylor: So a single scatter plot, when done well. can actually represent a lot of value

155
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.330
Anthony Taylor: not just to.

156
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.679
Anthony Taylor: But we need at least 2.

157
00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:42.950
Anthony Taylor: So then we're just gonna do our Y lim, and it's gonna break again and our x ln, and then that's it. Okay.

158
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:45.780
Anthony Taylor: y'all might.

159
00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.710
michael mcpherson: What is the Alpha

160
00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.560
Anthony Taylor: alpha is how transparent is it?

161
00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.600
Anthony Taylor: Right? So 1.0

162
00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.150
Anthony Taylor: stallage can't see through it at all. The reason

163
00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.710
Anthony Taylor: we do, Alpha.

164
00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:03.049
Anthony Taylor: If you have face color, you want to do our.

165
00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:05.940
Anthony Taylor: You want to explain why that might be

166
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:12.850
michael mcpherson: overlap. Look at this. Look at this circle right there. Oh.

167
00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:19.419
Anthony Taylor: that figures! You can't see it when you do that. But if you look at that circle, you see how you can see the circle underneath it.

168
00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:24.280
michael mcpherson: That's because we did, Alpha. If we didn't, that would just look like a blob.

169
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:26.460
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

170
00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:30.230
Anthony Taylor: so that's why we do, Alpha, any time we do face cover.

171
00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:31.700
michael mcpherson: Thank you.

172
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:33.479
Anthony Taylor: It's a great question.

173
00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:37.060
Anthony Taylor: Hi. feeling good.

174
00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:46.350
Anthony Taylor: pretty, straightforward, locked up together. Alright. We are going to go a few minutes over. That's probably because of my accidentally ending meeting. Apologize.

175
00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:56.730
Anthony Taylor:  So for this one I gotta give you 10. But I gotta be honest. This looks pretty straightforward. You're gonna have 3 values. Well.

176
00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:01.239
Anthony Taylor: but you guys just want to do this, doesn't everyone do? Let's do it as everyone

177
00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:02.909
Anthony Taylor: that's fine. We can do that.

178
00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:07.870
Anthony Taylor: We can do that. I don't think you need it as an. But

179
00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.829
that way we can get through on time. Mostly.

180
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:20.270
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So we're gonna change this BYNP. L.

181
00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.970
Anthony Taylor: Going to

182
00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.569
Anthony Taylor: run that one

183
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:41.409
Anthony Taylor: alright gonna import. So here's the temps they gave us. And then they gave us. They? Okay. So we're going to. We're going to have map, plot, live.

184
00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:44.120
Anthony Taylor: Create us

185
00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:50.509
Anthony Taylor: a charts that will have that. Now

186
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:55.349
Anthony Taylor: let's just go straight down here. We don't need to do the without scoop price. Let's throw this in.

187
00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:57.540
Anthony Taylor: So this will be our third value.

188
00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:02.420
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we're going to do pl tatter.

189
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.260
Anthony Taylor: and we're gonna pass in our X, which was 10,

190
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:15.280
Anthony Taylor: our Y, which was failed. Honestly, you could have reversed them. It wouldn't have been that big a deal. You just have to make sure you do your labels right?

191
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:21.250
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna do a circle. So we'll say, Marker equals. O,

192
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.260
Anthony Taylor: okay.

193
00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.489
and then face color.

194
00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:32.159
Anthony Taylor: That's interesting. Why did it go away? It shouldn't stay there, and then we'll do red again.

195
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.530
Edge colors.

196
00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.180
Anthony Taylor: what?

197
00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:42.890
Anthony Taylor: And then for Ste, we're going to use scoop price.

198
00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:51.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Which is kind of cool, right? We can say, Okay, well, this is the individual scoop price. And that's really all we need.

199
00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.000
Anthony Taylor: Once you have that, you can plot that show.

200
00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:06.519
Anthony Taylor: And what did I not run? Oh, I didn't run to sell. That was lame. Okay, and see and hearing. You can see we have

201
00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.880
Anthony Taylor: our temp. our sales.

202
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:14.760
Anthony Taylor: and the size is how much we were charging by the school

203
00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:18.460
Anthony Taylor: definitely a correlation here. Huh?

204
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:31.789
Mccanse, Meredith: Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. I'm sorry I didn't need to interrupt. Oh, when you say the S. Are you saying size 5 Si ze like small medium, large.

205
00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:34.329
Anthony Taylor: yes, and the size of the circle.

206
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.919
Anthony Taylor: So the size of the circle, like

207
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:40.770
Anthony Taylor: like, if you look here, you know, the first one was 89.

208
00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:49.589
Anthony Taylor: The first value, which was 14 to 215. So 14 to 215. So this one. you see how it's kind of big

209
00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:54.640
Anthony Taylor: right? And then like this one, the third 1, 11, 9, 1, 85,

210
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.370
Anthony Taylor: 11, 9, 1 85. D.

211
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:59.180
Mccanse, Meredith: Got it. Okay? Yup.

212
00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:04.420
Baro, Sonja: thank you. Thank you

213
00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.250
Baro, Sonja: was like, cause, what's making it bigger, small.

214
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:12.220
Anthony Taylor: right? Because of that? That's what they asked. That that's all that does. That's why I'm saying. That's what's so cool.

215
00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:14.800
Anthony Taylor: We get 1, 2,

216
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:22.420
Anthony Taylor: 3 different values to look at in one chart, and like I said we could do the color too sorry.

217
00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:23.859
Anthony Taylor: alright like.

218
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:32.920
Clayton Graves: Why your dots look so much bigger than mine. That's not a euphemism. Why, why.

219
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:38.450
Anthony Taylor: II don't know. Let me see yours. I don't know. It's probably just

220
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:41.819
Anthony Taylor: some kind of formatting or something or screen, or

221
00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:47.550
Anthony Taylor: maybe my red, because I do have my stuff scaled up really big. So you guys can see it. But

222
00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.499
Anthony Taylor: oh, looks like your size is wrong. Go back up.

223
00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:00.759
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Okay. So while that is great.

224
00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:06.370
Anthony Taylor: move that below scoop price. So so copy that line you you wrote there.

225
00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:08.879
Anthony Taylor: we can fix this fast

226
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:14.520
Anthony Taylor: or cut it. Yeah, and then put it under here under scoop price

227
00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.750
Anthony Taylor: uncomment scoop.

228
00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:25.239
Anthony Taylor: This member control slash or you're complete. Go ahead and comment this line back out. So you don't

229
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.090
Anthony Taylor: accidentally run it again.

230
00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.820
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and then here, up that. That too sorry.

231
00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:38.239
Anthony Taylor: And then here put S. Equals scoop price

232
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.780
Anthony Taylor: instead of 10.

233
00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:46.419
Anthony Taylor: Now run it.

234
00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:54.270
Anthony Taylor: you having that weird problem like I'm having you have to restart everything, every name time.

235
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:56.720
Derek Rikke: Give you show.

236
00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:09.170
Anthony Taylor: Oh, yeah, yeah, you could. Yeah, you got you, Plato. Thank you very much. But actually, I guess you don't with that one. But yeah. So now you have your science. So good work.

237
00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:17.030
Anthony Taylor: Okay? What else is on here? Okay, so real quick. We'll do y-lin.

238
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:25.689
Anthony Taylor: And and I mean, I've kind of blossomed over. Why, we ended all of that stuff. But honestly, guys, these were these are really.

239
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:29.580
Anthony Taylor: I mean, they can be

240
00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:38.599
Anthony Taylor: really helpful like if you have like a chart that's just totally imbalanced. Putting in Xlim and Y Lim is helpful.

241
00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:42.949
Anthony Taylor: And and again, I'm gonna say, this is another one of those moments

242
00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:47.740
Anthony Taylor: where if II mean when I'm doing something like this for a data science project.

243
00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:53.439
Anthony Taylor: I'm I'm I'm not worrying too much about, you know whether or not

244
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.699
Anthony Taylor: there's space around the

245
00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:04.580
Anthony Taylor:  the chart. Okay. So here, ice cream sales versus Tim.

246
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:14.180
Anthony Taylor: That's our title. But dots hex label. we'll just say, Temp.

247
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:17.690
Anthony Taylor: You might want to be a little more descriptive.

248
00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:18.770
Anthony Taylor: but that

249
00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.589
Anthony Taylor: Bilabel is sales.

250
00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.320
Anthony Taylor: and

251
00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:27.090
Anthony Taylor: we'll go ahead and show it again.

252
00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:31.719
Anthony Taylor: and there we go. Oh, I'm way zoomed in, or something. What happened there?

253
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:37.039
Anthony Taylor: Well, that's interesting. What? Oh. but I do.

254
00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:39.940
Anthony Taylor: That's so weird.

255
00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's alright. We can fix it.

256
00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.989
Jennifer Dahlgren: I think, on your y lim, you you can put in like 200.

257
00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:57.939
Anthony Taylor: Did I do something weird? Oh, you're right. 186, 20.

258
00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:01.289
Anthony Taylor: I'm not even dyslexic. That was just me.

259
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.720
michael mcpherson: I did Max sales plus a hundred.

260
00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.220
Anthony Taylor: And that is the way to do it right.

261
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.960
Anthony Taylor: Okay. What Mike just said is actually the way that

262
00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:20.400
Anthony Taylor: I would want you to do this, and you'll learn to do it more when we do Pantis tomorrow. But yeah, I mean, mathematically doing this makes sense

263
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:24.380
Anthony Taylor: doing this like hard coded like this is really.

264
00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:32.359
Anthony Taylor: it's okay. If you just, you know one visual. But you know what if the data substantially changed? And

265
00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:41.100
Anthony Taylor: now you're you know. Why don't we change it to Fahrenheit all of a sudden? Now you have to go hard code and change everything. You do it. The way Michael just said you wouldn't have to.

266
00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:46.660
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But that's it. Questions

267
00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.100
Anthony Taylor: pretty exciting.

268
00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:57.000
Anthony Taylor: I can. You guys have a great night? I we will be here for office hours.

269
00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:01.350
Anthony Taylor:  Feel free to stop in.

270
00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:03.750
Anthony Taylor: We can discuss anything you like.
