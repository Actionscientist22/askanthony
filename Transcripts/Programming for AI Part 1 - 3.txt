00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.690
Anthony Taylor: Resuming.

2
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.750
Anthony Taylor: welcome back.

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:20.120
Anthony Taylor: everybody. Wait! How many people are here? This looks like no, it's probably about right. Huh? I know we're missing one Mac, for sure.

4
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.990
Anthony Taylor: Where's Meredith?

5
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.140
michael mcpherson: Especially? Your class is so small you can miss one person.

6
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.110
sonja baro:  we're probably coming.

7
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.890
sonja baro: Look at that! Look at that! Look at that

8
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.710
Anthony Taylor: watch.

9
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.610
sonja baro: Watch what?

10
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:46.590
Anthony Taylor: Pretend like we're all frozen when she comes in. Yeah.

11
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.119
Anthony Taylor: we were all frozen for you, Meredith. We were just messing around.

12
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.319
Anthony Taylor: Okay,

13
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:18.860
michael mcpherson: Sorry I thought I was on mute. I was I was coding. So he's doing circus music all right, man.

14
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.740
Anthony Taylor: Alright! No, you know what III used to.

15
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.630
Anthony Taylor: So one more. Hold on

16
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.349
Anthony Taylor: alright, everybody. So here we go. First off we have to remember.

17
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.070
Anthony Taylor: We're we're one lesson behind

18
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:43.739
Anthony Taylor: on from last class. So we're going to start with that one. But before we do, I just want to give you guys a little bitty pep talk you'll be with.

19
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.709
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So first off fistfight. How you feeling right now about all of this

20
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.710
Anthony Taylor: one I have no idea. Why, here 5. I'm a freaking genius.

21
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.630
Anthony Taylor: We got some some data, too.

22
00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.150
Anthony Taylor: Alright, 3, 2, 3. That's about what I would expect. Okay, and great to see the fours.

23
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.110
Anthony Taylor: Alright, that's awesome.

24
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.290
Anthony Taylor:  I just want to explain something to you.

25
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.750
Anthony Taylor: You guys have only been learning the code for 6 h

26
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.380
Anthony Taylor: 6 h.

27
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.209
Anthony Taylor: That's probably the same amount of time, for when you woke up till you ate lunch today

28
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.760
Anthony Taylor: 6 h. I want you to realize already what you've learned in that amount of time.

29
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.389
Anthony Taylor: how much stuff you're doing that you didn't know how to do a week ago.

30
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.989
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we are moving at a very fast pace.

31
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:51.820
Anthony Taylor: I promise we are going to redo these things. You are going to do them many, many times. and it will be challenging. And you're going to be great. But already in just 6 h.

32
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.870
Anthony Taylor: you guys are using github.

33
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.650
Anthony Taylor: You guys know how to open notebooks. You guys know how to run. Python. Tell, you know what python is.

34
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.539
Anthony Taylor: Okay? You can do loops, you can create variables. You can

35
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.860
Anthony Taylor: all of these different fun things.

36
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.580
Anthony Taylor: 6 h.

37
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.480
Anthony Taylor: That's

38
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.130
Anthony Taylor: shocking. So those numbers you flipped in the air

39
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.330
Anthony Taylor: 6 h. And you're there.

40
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.929
Anthony Taylor: That's pretty doggone. Good.

41
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.529
Anthony Taylor: Okay. First week that was his talk. What, Rodney.

42
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:43.829
Anthony Taylor: hey? Most mornings between breakfast and lunch. I haven't even finished reading the news yet.

43
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.010
Anthony Taylor: So yeah.

44
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.530
Mason, Natalie: do you find that people who take these courses tend to be

45
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.570
Mason, Natalie: maybe for lack of a better word, perfectionist or overthinkers?

46
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.720
Anthony Taylor: I see all kinds of courses.

47
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:11.650
Anthony Taylor: I see folks that have a lot of background in it. They come in and they think they're going to rock this course, and then they just they. After a few weeks they go. Oh, God!

48
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:23.839
Anthony Taylor: Right cause they were so confident. And then all of a sudden, they're like they're like, they don't know what to do. And they haven't been going through the same problems you guys have. And all of a sudden some of you will start to ask

49
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:36.080
Anthony Taylor: right? Because you're you're forcing yourself to learn faster again. you're basically relearning how to work. They, since they felt they already knew it. They've been skating.

50
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.849
Anthony Taylor: and then we all of a sudden hit something they've never seen before. I'm just like, Oh.

51
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.640
Anthony Taylor: okay, so that's the that's one thing we see a lot.

52
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.130
Anthony Taylor: we do get the like. Sal and I have

53
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.460
Anthony Taylor: in a cohorts. I have had one student.

54
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.030
Anthony Taylor: not graduates

55
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.460
Anthony Taylor: one.

56
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.599
michael mcpherson: and that's a new area.

57
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.330
Anthony Taylor: Sorry?

58
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.839
michael mcpherson: Why, me, we haven't even got there yet.

59
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:13.599
Anthony Taylor: That one student about we 14. He just stopped talking.

60
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:22.180
Anthony Taylor: He never talked, he never did. He never turned any homework after week. 14. Never did anybody showed up at every class

61
00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.600
Anthony Taylor: until the final project.

62
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:35.510
Anthony Taylor: but he missed third, the third project and the last project, and you can't miss a project so we can't. We couldn't pass it, but he showed up. He got all the information.

63
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.330
Anthony Taylor: but he never spoke, never turned on his camera after week. 14. We don't know why.

64
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:48.500
Anthony Taylor: but, he finished and didn't pass. We've had a couple like we've had people who lost family members and stuff, and they quit and stuff like that. But

65
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:49.919
Anthony Taylor: for the most part

66
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.250
Anthony Taylor: my students finish, and they rocked

67
00:05:53.850 --> 00:06:01.630
Anthony Taylor: alright. So let's get to this before we get even further behind. So the next thing we're gonna talk about is nested

68
00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:03.790
Anthony Taylor: conditionals

69
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.350
Anthony Taylor: alright, which all that really means is we're gonna put conditionals inside of conditionals.

70
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:17.320
Anthony Taylor: That's it. Okay? So in this first example, we're saying, if the price well, here, let's run this first cell

71
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:24.409
Anthony Taylor: issue currency price. Third, okay. if the price is greater than or equal to 0.

72
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:34.189
Anthony Taylor: And then we say, Okay, so that's the first thing. If it's greater than 0, we're going to do all of this stuff. How do I? How do I know? That's what stuff we're going to do?

73
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.619
Derek Rikke: We talked about this yesterday. Yeah, there.

74
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:54.020
Anthony Taylor: it's indented. It's all it all has the same indentation. So I know I'm going to go to here because the invitation goes out right here. Okay, so it says, if it's greater than 0 and

75
00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.820
Anthony Taylor: well, not, and then we're going to check and see if the currency is Usd.

76
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:05.960
Anthony Taylor: If it is, we'll do this. If it's not, then do it. Else if is it? Ui?

77
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:18.109
Anthony Taylor: Well, it is so. We're going to print. The currency is we're going to do that cool symbol which I don't even know how to type. Okay? And the price. Else we're just going to say it's not us dollar or euro.

78
00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:19.700
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, euros

79
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:27.959
Anthony Taylor: else print. There's a. So if it's not 0, if it's like negative, one print error, the price listed is a negative number.

80
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:35.310
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So here's the first, if and notice in Vs code. We can do this

81
00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.239
Anthony Taylor: alright. You see what I did there

82
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.110
Anthony Taylor: it collapsed. Everything inside of that that if statement

83
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:48.819
Anthony Taylor: that also lets you kind. If you're when your indentation is perfect. you can do that and see what is included.

84
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so that's that we run that we're gonna get.

85
00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.050
Anthony Taylor: Oh, I haven't done my kernel yet.

86
00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.149
Anthony Taylor: Hold on, that's gonna fail because I didn't do the first one.

87
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:00.960
Anthony Taylor: Hmm, hmm!

88
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.570
Anthony Taylor: There you go. Okay, now we can do. I'll

89
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:12.680
Anthony Taylor: alright, guys, you're gonna have to fix this one. I'm sorry. Oh, wait! No, you're not just delete these 2 sales.

90
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:18.060
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So here we're going to do a condition. And this is a very common thing.

91
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:26.379
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're going to do a condition inside of a loop. So we're basically going to say while true.

92
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.849
Anthony Taylor: Now that's interesting. while true. Can it? Can true, ever be false?

93
00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:42.070
Anthony Taylor: No, so does this loop have an in right now. It does not. So we need to make sure that this thing has a break or something, and we'll get to that.

94
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:52.600
Anthony Taylor: So first thing, it's going to create this variable that's empty. And then we're going to say, Well, if the user number is not an int type of it.

95
00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.969
Anthony Taylor: ask how many numbers

96
00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:02.980
Anthony Taylor: we're going to answer the question. It's going to say, if it is a digit user number is user number, else you didn't put in the number.

97
00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:08.729
Anthony Taylor: And then it's going to say, okay, so 4 x in range of

98
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:13.510
Anthony Taylor: user number. So whatever we put in, it's going to loop that many times

99
00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:17.280
Anthony Taylor: print X, so it's going to go 0 1, 2, however many we do.

100
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:23.260
Anthony Taylor: If X is greater than equal to 20, your input number is too high breaking loop

101
00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.340
Anthony Taylor: break.

102
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.859
Anthony Taylor: Okay, once complete.

103
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.349
Anthony Taylor: So when this loop completes

104
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:38.460
Anthony Taylor: again. We can see by the indentation. Or if you really, if you're in Vs code, you can simply come over here and click and see what's in it.

105
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:45.619
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Then we're going to ask, do you want to quit to exit and anything else to continue?

106
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:52.710
Anthony Taylor: So this queue does not change true. What it does is we're going to do this.

107
00:09:52.810 --> 00:10:03.320
Anthony Taylor: If user play is Q break. If it's not Q, it's just going to go and start again. The whole thing. All right. So let's run this and see how this looks.

108
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:07.659
Anthony Taylor: So I'm gonna run this. I'm gonna do 5 numbers hit enter.

109
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:10.880
Anthony Taylor: And you see? 0 1, 2, 3, 4.

110
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.739
Anthony Taylor: Okay. If I hit enter again, it's gonna ask me for numbers. I'm gonna put 25 in there this time.

111
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:23.470
Anthony Taylor: Hit enter. And now it's going, going, going. It says your input number is too high breaking loop.

112
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.940
Anthony Taylor: So it sent us to the do you want to quit again.

113
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.550
Anthony Taylor: If I put in Q,

114
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:31.560
Anthony Taylor: it's it's over. It's stuck.

115
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:33.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

116
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.659
Anthony Taylor: Any questions about how that works.

117
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:48.980
Anthony Taylor: Now. Hi, we won't do this activity. I'm just going to walk you through it.

118
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:55.590
Anthony Taylor: and then we'll get on to today's stuff cause you're gonna do something like this in today's like first activity. So I'm not too worried about.

119
00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:00.809
Anthony Taylor: So here we're going to say we have this brides list

120
00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.070
Anthony Taylor: and prices list.

121
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:14.159
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna say, what right should be added to the amusement park. We're going to add it to the bride sleeve. Then we're gonna say, Wow, true.

122
00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:26.249
Anthony Taylor: Input how much does it cost to ride this ride? We're gonna create the variable cost. If cost stop replaced, they're going to get rid of this period. If it's there

123
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.169
Anthony Taylor: is digit.

124
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:38.540
Anthony Taylor: then if float cost is less than equal 15. Append it to price. else please choose a price that is $15 or less.

125
00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:43.339
Anthony Taylor: else you didn't input a valid price. What does that mean. So this, if

126
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:50.999
Anthony Taylor: stops right there. it includes an if that has an else.

127
00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:58.150
Anthony Taylor: So if this, if isn't true, it's going to run this else and then move on.

128
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:10.790
Anthony Taylor: If this, if isn't true. it's gonna run this this, if says, if I get rid of the period assuming it has one. is it a number. Okay?

129
00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:15.190
Anthony Taylor:  And then at the end, it just asks you to

130
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:20.499
Anthony Taylor: red redo your time. Okay, so let's rem this.

131
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.130
Anthony Taylor: What rides should be added, cars

132
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.360
Anthony Taylor: heather 5 enter.

133
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:41.819
Anthony Taylor: and we see nothing. Oh, we don't see anything because we didn't tell it out, but now we can say, for I range frides discount if priced. This is just another loop we got a for loop.

134
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.770
Anthony Taylor: We've got an if condition

135
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:51.149
Anthony Taylor: that stops there. and then another, if condition that stops

136
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:56.609
Anthony Taylor: there and then we're going to print out some stuff car costs $5.

137
00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:02.709
Anthony Taylor: Got it? Does that make sense to everybody looking at your faces

138
00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:08.750
Anthony Taylor: like so much text for it to be such a short answer.

139
00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:16.109
Anthony Taylor: That is a wonderful observation.

140
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:21.740
Mason, Natalie: I know it's stating the obvious. But

141
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:23.500
Anthony Taylor: hold on.

142
00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:29.289
sonja baro: Wouldn't that change potentially when you based off the input

143
00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:36.609
sonja baro: like, it could get longer. I don't know. Maybe not because it's

144
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:40.369
Anthony Taylor: 1 s

145
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.320
Anthony Taylor: is this better?

146
00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:57.440
Anthony Taylor: And look at that here we go.

147
00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:05.429
Anthony Taylor: So did you see what I did? Who saw what I did?

148
00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.489
Mason, Natalie: I just I saw it.

149
00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:14.180
michael mcpherson: So it's automatic generated for the code. Right?

150
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:20.010
Anthony Taylor: So what I did, I actually, it's called co-pilot. By the way, which is just like Chat Gp for

151
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:30.689
Anthony Taylor: for for Github, R 4 vs. Code.  But basically, I just told it. I said, you know what generate me 50 rides and 50 prices

152
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.550
Anthony Taylor: because we were inputting it. I only input one.

153
00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.690
Anthony Taylor: And you're right to do that. For one thing, that would be lame.

154
00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:40.980
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But

155
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:47.089
Anthony Taylor: most of the time when we're doing this work, it's going to be hundreds, thousands.

156
00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.880
Anthony Taylor: Hell in my case. Millions.

157
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.380
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so it it does. The idea here, though, is just learn with small amounts.

158
00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:02.110
Anthony Taylor: And until you understand. But I wanted to give you. I wanted to show you this

159
00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:06.669
Anthony Taylor: look, and I'll answer 1 s. So it says, let's talk about how it did this.

160
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:08.940
Anthony Taylor: for I in range. 50

161
00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:20.060
Anthony Taylor: ride right? I plus one rides a PIN right price round random uniform, one to 22 price a PIN price. Actually, what kind of rides do you come up with.

162
00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.310
Anthony Taylor: Oh, see, it just gave us right. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

163
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.210
Anthony Taylor: It's not that great.

164
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.480
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But it worked.

165
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:31.760
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

166
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:35.550
Anthony Taylor: Hi! Tanya, your hand was up for, please, what's up?

167
00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:55.999
sonja baro: Yeah. I was just wondering. So that, based on what you were trying to do, didn't you show us away yesterday, like I think you use Len like, if you were to create another way that would make the code go back through. You make one change to it. You don't have to make all the changes to the code.

168
00:15:56.510 --> 00:16:02.229
sonja baro: and that's true. So I was just trying to think, is that a way you could have done that as well.

169
00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:03.570
Anthony Taylor: You, I mean.

170
00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:07.960
Anthony Taylor: well, the link would only help. A link is basically gonna be a condition.

171
00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:13.030
Anthony Taylor: So you're gonna say, if the link is this, or less than this, or greater than this? Do this

172
00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:30.309
Anthony Taylor: right? Unless you need it, unless you're doing like an analysis thing or something you need to know if there's something there at all. Right. This this little generator. I mean, it's just something co-pilot came up with, really fast. If we ask the same question in like Chat Gp, it might be even more left.

173
00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:41.179
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, there's this is a good way to do it. and I could and see. And this is why I love all these generators and chat Tpp's. And this is why I want you guys to think about them

174
00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.439
Anthony Taylor: is could've wrote this out of my head.

175
00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:51.249
Anthony Taylor: but I mean, how long did it take for the co-pilot to give it to a few seconds? Come, move on.

176
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:53.570
Anthony Taylor: Yes, click!

177
00:16:54.270 --> 00:17:05.389
Clayton Graves: My concern is that I seem to get lost when you're explaining. III lose the logic, the flow of logic as to what's being done.

178
00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:06.849
Anthony Taylor: Aston.

179
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:09.500
Clayton Graves: is that I mean

180
00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:22.530
Clayton Graves: it will come to you. But I'm happy to like. Go through it one more time. Just just the logic. II don't want to do that, because II know we're behind, and I don't want to push more.

181
00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:24.470
Clayton Graves: Alright.

182
00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:31.780
Anthony Taylor: Well, real quick. Let's just talk about this logic. what we're trying to do this tough. Wait. Yeah, Brandon.

183
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:40.780
Mckimmy, Brandon: I'm still running the issues when I run this. It doesn't let me run the code properly, and I'm not getting any value after I do it.

184
00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.040
Anthony Taylor: Did you run the next line?

185
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:47.200
Mckimmy, Brandon: I ran it, and it keeps crashing on me.

186
00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.910
Anthony Taylor: Okay, hold on, let's let's see his thing real quick. Show me

187
00:17:55.170 --> 00:18:01.809
Anthony Taylor: while true. Blah! Blah! Blah! Blah! Blah! Up at the top, it says, what right want to add

188
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:05.699
Anthony Taylor: up here, bed.

189
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:26.530
Anthony Taylor: Oh, I'm looking down here. I thought it was the terminal trying to ask  type type of ride, roller, ghost, or whatever you want whatever you want now, how much does it cost? 7?

190
00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.829
Anthony Taylor: It's not gonna like that. But go ahead, do it.

191
00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:38.830
Anthony Taylor: And now oh, see, it said it didn't like it. You didn't put in a valid price. Try again.

192
00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.930
Anthony Taylor: No dollar sign. There you go. Enter now hit. Q.

193
00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:53.340
Anthony Taylor: Enter. We're perfect. Now run the last cell, and it'll give you that

194
00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:55.969
Mckimmy, Brandon: this one or the other one

195
00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.349
Anthony Taylor: the next cell.

196
00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.440
Anthony Taylor: and go down

197
00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.900
Anthony Taylor: there. It is rollercoaster with a discount.

198
00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:06.770
Mckimmy, Brandon: Oh, nice work. Yes, I'm yeah.

199
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:12.970
sonja baro: When I, for some reason I'm getting a kernel crash.

200
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:17.769
sonja baro: Yeah, hang on, there we go.

201
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:26.149
sonja baro: Bulletin board. What's that up there is that like work stuff? Or is that class?

202
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.260
sonja baro: Where where are you looking at?

203
00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:33.890
Anthony Taylor: I'm looking at your bulletin board on the left there, what the little box looks like a flow chart, or like a

204
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.020
Anthony Taylor: or chart.

205
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:54.330
sonja baro: This this is like, has been the best thing for me as product manager. I got this 25 years ago, and it's talks about the roles within product management which there's very much technical in the middle. There's upstream and downstream. So it just helps me

206
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:58.950
Anthony Taylor: remember that I have a few product manager, anyway. Share your screen. Sorry.

207
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:03.560
sonja baro: Sorry I had to like. Do a little show and tell there

208
00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:13.439
Anthony Taylor: pragmatic pragmatic marketing if you're interested in it. Let's see.

209
00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:18.710
sonja baro: Name right, did you? Didn't run the first cell I'm gathering. Well, wait

210
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:21.279
Anthony Taylor: hit restart at the hit

211
00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.609
Anthony Taylor: hit restart

212
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:26.700
Anthony Taylor: and say, Yeah, we start.

213
00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.840
Anthony Taylor: okay. And now hit play.

214
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:34.590
sonja baro: Now, hit play again.

215
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.909
sonja baro: And now type, okay, I'm good. I got it. Okay.

216
00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:41.120
sonja baro: Thank you.

217
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:43.729
Anthony Taylor: Alright, so real quick.

218
00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:51.539
Anthony Taylor: We'll talk through the flow of this one more time. So the goal was to ask our user to add a ride to a part.

219
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:57.379
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So the first thing we're gonna do create 2 empty lists, we're gonna add, right?

220
00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:59.479
Anthony Taylor: Just input, good.

221
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:04.570
Anthony Taylor: Then we're going to check their data that they entered.

222
00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:09.899
Anthony Taylor: Well, not yet. First we're gonna ask them to add a cost for that. Right? Then we're gonna check their date.

223
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:13.110
sonja baro: So like what Brandon did

224
00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.560
Anthony Taylor: he put in a dollar sign. Well.

225
00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:20.320
Anthony Taylor: this check will look for periods, but not for dollars.

226
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:26.889
Anthony Taylor: So it failed this check, and it said, Nope, do it again, or sit down here. Nope, do it again

227
00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:34.250
Anthony Taylor: after it checks. If they put in a proper number, it checks to see if the if the number was less than 15,

228
00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:39.270
Anthony Taylor: if it was less than 15. We're going to add it to our list.

229
00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:42.680
Anthony Taylor: If it was not, we tell them to make a different number.

230
00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.179
Anthony Taylor: Okay, when this is all done, we have 2 lists.

231
00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:51.699
Anthony Taylor: with, however, many rides, with however many prices.

232
00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:55.159
Anthony Taylor: Then we're going to go through the list.

233
00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.490
Anthony Taylor: One loop at a time.

234
00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:06.140
Anthony Taylor: We're going to create a variable called discounting this false. We're gonna look at each price price was greater than 5.

235
00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:08.069
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna lower that. Well.

236
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:12.140
Anthony Taylor: we're going to lower that price by 10%, multiplying it by point 9.

237
00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:16.060
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then we're going to say discounting was true.

238
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:22.060
Anthony Taylor: If the price was not greater than 5, we're not doing anything to stop

239
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:28.069
Anthony Taylor: if and then if discount. So if we gave it a discount.

240
00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.229
Anthony Taylor: we we state a 10% discount is a buck.

241
00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:34.419
Anthony Taylor: and then we print some dashes to separate each one.

242
00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:36.470
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

243
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.520
Anthony Taylor: pretty. Is that a little better cling?

244
00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.040
Clayton Graves: I think. So, yeah.

245
00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:47.139
Anthony Taylor: cool. That's all right. We're gonna do more of these. That could be more right now. So let's switch to the

246
00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.660
Anthony Taylor: the day. 3 activities folder.

247
00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:58.589
Anthony Taylor: Let's get started with today's first off. Let me find our wiki cool slideshow.

248
00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:01.869
Anthony Taylor: that ain't it?

249
00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.950
Anthony Taylor: Oh, I know what I did. and

250
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.590
Anthony Taylor: want to get it. I closed it earlier

251
00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:13.569
Anthony Taylor: when I was showing something.

252
00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:15.769
Anthony Taylor: Here we go

253
00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:19.350
Anthony Taylor: alright.

254
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:30.080
Anthony Taylor: complex program decisions. Right there, you know, today is, gonna be exciting. How many of you did resources. It's last night or today. anybody.

255
00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:33.429
sonja baro: Yeah, Dave, Christine.

256
00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:52.269
Anthony Taylor: just to, I'm just kidding. They don't get anything. But they're gonna know what's going on. Okay. So we're gonna refactor and a an existing, if else, if else, into what's called a match case structure. Now.

257
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:58.980
Anthony Taylor: I love Matt's case structure. And I wish I used it more. But what you're gonna find out is this like really new iphone?

258
00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:09.290
Anthony Taylor: When I first thought I was like, Oh. I haven't done that very much, so I'm I'm excited to show it to you, because it might help me remember to use it more often.

259
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:15.190
Anthony Taylor: We're also going to create and manipulate a python dictionary.

260
00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.069
Anthony Taylor: You might be wondering what that is. Well.

261
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:22.239
Anthony Taylor: what I would tell you

262
00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:26.290
Anthony Taylor: is, it's it's it's a really cool thing. I'll show you in a minute

263
00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:37.399
Anthony Taylor: demonstrate the ability to iterate through complex nested data structures such as lists within lists. We have talked about that, or lists of dictionaries. Oh.

264
00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:43.899
Anthony Taylor: extract specific information, use list, comprehension. This is a cool pythonic

265
00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:49.229
Anthony Taylor: technique. Pythonic is a word that you will hear when we talk about

266
00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:53.589
Anthony Taylor: like python fullness. Okay? And that's it.

267
00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:58.650
Anthony Taylor: Who are these people? Will? Susanna? Okay.

268
00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:04.489
Anthony Taylor:  hi, so we're gonna start with an activity like I said.

269
00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:12.620
Anthony Taylor: so let's go and look at this activity. Oh, it's in everyone. Do. So we're going to do it together. So everyone open the unsolved

270
00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:15.569
Anthony Taylor: rock paper scissor

271
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:16.670
Anthony Taylor: notebook.

272
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:18.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

273
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:27.420
Anthony Taylor: alright.

274
00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:33.630
Anthony Taylor: So we got a couple of things they've added right away for us. Okay, this is a library.

275
00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:37.669
Anthony Taylor: It's called Random. We're gonna talk more about libraries later. But

276
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:41.510
Anthony Taylor: we import libraries or packages.

277
00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:45.659
Anthony Taylor: That other people have created, or other companies.

278
00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:49.900
Anthony Taylor: and they give us additional functionality from just base. Python

279
00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:56.199
Anthony Taylor: random is a library that allows us to create like, select something at random.

280
00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:59.109
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's all it does.

281
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:03.099
Anthony Taylor:  So we're going to import that library.

282
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:17.690
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to

283
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:23.139
Anthony Taylor: right now. Yeah. But like, eventually, you're gonna import your own libraries. You just type import.

284
00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:26.790
Anthony Taylor: There's there are some other variations. We'll show you those as we come around.

285
00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.610
Mccanse, Meredith: Okay, okay.

286
00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:32.640
Anthony Taylor: Next, we're gonna run this cell, which is just gonna print out the title of our game.

287
00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.259
Anthony Taylor: Then we're going to create the

288
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:41.220
Anthony Taylor: rock paper scissor options. Everyone's familiar with rock paper scissors.

289
00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:43.979
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I figured you.

290
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:46.490
Anthony Taylor: So we learn that.

291
00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:54.049
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now we have this. We got this code we need to write. Okay. Now, I will tell you we're going to combine some of this.

292
00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:57.020
Anthony Taylor:  I didn't think to do it today.

293
00:26:57.170 --> 00:27:02.120
sonja baro: I did it yesterday. I didn't do it today. So I'm gonna combine some of these.

294
00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.259
Anthony Taylor: All I'm doing is copying

295
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:05.570
sonja baro: and pasting

296
00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:11.420
Anthony Taylor: and paste. Nothing. Fancy. Do make sure that they're on the same

297
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.909
Anthony Taylor: indent unless I tell you other

298
00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.320
Anthony Taylor: hold on, guys and check with that.

299
00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:21.219
sonja baro: That's all right.

300
00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:28.790
sonja baro: I'm trying to do. And then just delete the others check. If the user, what are you doing out here?

301
00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:30.610
Anthony Taylor: What's up?

302
00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:37.769
Anthony Taylor: Why do you have to 00, my goodness, feed you guys, okay, just give me a minute.

303
00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:45.000
Anthony Taylor: I my dogs are tripping. They're like Dad didn't feed us yet. It's 80'clock. Okay,

304
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:51.940
Anthony Taylor: hold on. No, you can't come here. You want to say how you come up. But I gotta work. Okay, so we've got

305
00:27:51.970 --> 00:28:03.960
Anthony Taylor: that one. We're gonna delete this cell. this one. We're gonna delete this cell. This, we're going to add to it. Okay. yeah, just stopped it. Let's just do one at a time.

306
00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:10.169
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so what we're gonna do is this create a continuous loop? We'll do while true

307
00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:22.050
Anthony Taylor: alright can hit a cold. It entered alright. Now, our first one. It already gave us this we can go. We're good with that

308
00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:28.239
Anthony Taylor: now. It says, check. If the user selected a valid choice from the options list, how would we do that?

309
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:30.810
Anthony Taylor: What are the valid choices?

310
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.920
sonja baro: Rock paper scissors aren't here as

311
00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:41.769
Anthony Taylor: exactly okay. So what we're gonna say is, if

312
00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.479
Anthony Taylor: user choice, that's the name of the variable that we're assigning

313
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:50.950
Anthony Taylor: so it needs to be. RS. Is in

314
00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:55.380
Anthony Taylor: this cool list we made up here options.

315
00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.500
Anthony Taylor: Then it's true.

316
00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:05.210
Anthony Taylor: Right? So let's hit enter and then so if that's true, we're going to create

317
00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:13.370
Anthony Taylor: this guy. So we basically do need to tap this one over. We want it in this. If condition. See how it's in here. Now.

318
00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:21.250
Anthony Taylor: we're going to say computer's choice is random choice. So random, random dot choice. And you can actually here you go.

319
00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.240
Anthony Taylor: we still

320
00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:33.540
Anthony Taylor: choose a random element from a non-empty sequence. So we're passing in options. Which is this, it's going to randomly select one of those values. That's all it's doing.

321
00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:36.210
Anthony Taylor: And it's going to assign that value

322
00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:40.370
Anthony Taylor: to computer choice. So we basically have our game, right?

323
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:45.230
Anthony Taylor: We told the user to pick one. And now the computer has picked one.

324
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:47.470
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

325
00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:51.119
Anthony Taylor: So now we need to do, we need to see who won.

326
00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:56.040
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So yeah, I didn't worry about all that stuff down below.

327
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.969
sonja baro: So we're gonna say, if

328
00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.040
Anthony Taylor: no go ahead, Sony, what's wrong?

329
00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:14.510
sonja baro: Oh, sorry I didn't realize I was on mute. So I'm I'm with you. The thing is is, I'm trying to align my tabs and my tabs online. But I have the little red, squiggly.

330
00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:16.640
Anthony Taylor: Well, that's because we're not done typing.

331
00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:21.190
sonja baro: Okay, I was alright sorry. I'll be okay. No, no, you're good.

332
00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:27.780
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So now we're gonna say, if the user choice. So this you if you were the user

333
00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.580
Anthony Taylor: equals. Equals.

334
00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:31.730
Anthony Taylor: right? Are

335
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:33.630
Anthony Taylor: call in

336
00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:36.610
Anthony Taylor: and

337
00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:43.789
Anthony Taylor: oh, why are they doing so now? We're gonna spell it out for some reason. So we're gonna create a variable called user

338
00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:52.660
Anthony Taylor: underscore, full underscore choice equals. And we're gonna spell it out alright.

339
00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:57.569
Anthony Taylor: not arithmetic error. That is very strange that you work.

340
00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:01.240
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Then we're gonna do an L. If

341
00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:02.610
Anthony Taylor: Colin.

342
00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:05.140
Anthony Taylor: not sure why I did that

343
00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:10.979
Anthony Taylor: and we're going. Oh, not L. If L. If space user choices. P

344
00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:15.070
Anthony Taylor: equals equals e

345
00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:18.470
alright do. And then Covid

346
00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:21.840
Anthony Taylor: enter user, full

347
00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.640
Anthony Taylor: choice equals paper.

348
00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:41.780
Anthony Taylor: And my auto bill is being very obnoxious. And then last, since there's only one more we'll do else. And for else we'll say, user underscore pull choice equals

349
00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:42.810
Anthony Taylor: scissors.

350
00:31:44.630 --> 00:32:01.870
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So now we have this new full choice variable. So now. after all of that. we're going to see who won or lost. Okay. so we're still under. If the user's choice was in options.

351
00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:07.880
Anthony Taylor: and we're going to say. yeah. user underscore choice

352
00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:18.820
Anthony Taylor: equals equals computer's choice. Right? So now we're saying, if they both picked rock. what happens

353
00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:24.100
Anthony Taylor: alright? And then we're gonna say, print F quote quotes

354
00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:26.109
Anthony Taylor: you both

355
00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:29.889
Anthony Taylor: shows. And then we're gonna type.

356
00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:36.190
Anthony Taylor: user, full choice. So we're gonna spell out the homework. So that's that's a nice way of doing this.

357
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:42.810
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Alright. So there's our first condition. What's the next condition?

358
00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.110
Anthony Taylor: Well, else if

359
00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:50.720
Anthony Taylor: user choice is our.

360
00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:57.029
Anthony Taylor: and we're going to do this in parentheses, because we're going to actually do. And 2 comparisons.

361
00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:01.340
Anthony Taylor: user underscore choice equals equals R

362
00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:04.170
Anthony Taylor: and computer

363
00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.929
Anthony Taylor: choice equals equals. P, who wins

364
00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:14.210
Anthony Taylor: what?

365
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:20.450
Mccanse, Meredith: Paper? No? Yes, paper. Right? Yeah. Paper wins. So print.

366
00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:25.830
We don't need F on this one

367
00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:33.060
Anthony Taylor: you chose rock. The computer shows paper.

368
00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:36.570
Clayton Graves: So in order for this new quarter. You have to pretty much

369
00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.349
Clayton Graves: type out every possible scenario.

370
00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:42.780
Anthony Taylor: You are absolutely right.

371
00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:53.129
Clayton Graves: I know, and you're still like, well, that's a lot of words, such as silly thing. Yes. And did you do you also have to do the full choice? Loop for the computer?

372
00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.430
Anthony Taylor: No, cause we don't care.

373
00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:59.320
Anthony Taylor: We're good. We're not gonna talk about what the computer does.

374
00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:00.520
Anthony Taylor: So

375
00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:08.250
Anthony Taylor: we'll do one more of these typed out. And then I'm just gonna paste them all to you guys. So we don't have to sit here and type all these over and over again.

376
00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:10.409
Anthony Taylor: Which one are we on now?

377
00:34:10.699 --> 00:34:17.019
Anthony Taylor: User choice wrap computer choice paper. So technically, you could also do something like this.

378
00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:23.560
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then we can say. user choice rocks.

379
00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:26.689
Anthony Taylor: computer choice scissors

380
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:29.199
Anthony Taylor: change this one the scissors.

381
00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:33.179
Anthony Taylor: and then, Hey, you win

382
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:42.290
Anthony Taylor: root. you win. Okay? And then I know just shut.

383
00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:53.690
Anthony Taylor: They are just Ripey, these dogs.  So I'm just gonna copy the rest of this and give it to you.

384
00:34:53.949 --> 00:34:57.530
Anthony Taylor: And then we're just gonna paste all those Lcifs in.

385
00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:02.550
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So we'll put this in slack under. Live?

386
00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:06.430
Excellent!

387
00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:11.959
Anthony Taylor: There you go.

388
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:18.270
Anthony Taylor: So now, when you get that, come in here and enter, go all the way to the left and paste.

389
00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:20.880
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

390
00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:28.540
Anthony Taylor: everybody with me on that.

391
00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:32.820
Masarirambi, Rodney: Just need a second catch up

392
00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:39.000
Kanouff, Christine: any chance you could paste. Give us the whole thing for that block.

393
00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:49.099
Anthony Taylor: You know what? That might be easier for those of us who got behind in our well, we still we still have a lot to type. So, but I am going to give you. I'm just going to give you the whole block right?

394
00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:54.589
Clayton Graves: I'm not sure type in this, and listening at the same time, or able to pull that off.

395
00:35:54.940 --> 00:36:00.909
Anthony Taylor: Which, by the way. that's a good point, right? You do not have to type along.

396
00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:06.369
Anthony Taylor: you know. Remember one we're going to give you the result, the the final and 2,

397
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:09.819
Anthony Taylor: you know, if you feel you would do better just listening

398
00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:15.840
Anthony Taylor: and watching. Go ahead and do that. But when you do the activities on your own, you need to be with doing it. With your group.

399
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:17.660
Anthony Taylor: Everyone dues you can.

400
00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:22.069
Anthony Taylor: You can have some free time. Alright. So I just put the whole cell up in there.

401
00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:23.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

402
00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:27.120
Anthony Taylor: so you guys should have it. But now

403
00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:28.309
Anthony Taylor: go ahead. Sorry.

404
00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:36.969
Clayton Graves: Know how many different combinations there are. I'm not good at figuring stuff out like that.

405
00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:41.130
Anthony Taylor: There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, total.

406
00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:46.199
Anthony Taylor: There's only 3 options. Yeah, there's only 3 options. So

407
00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.539
Anthony Taylor: and 3 of them are a tie.

408
00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:52.250
Anthony Taylor: So there you go. Okay. So

409
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:57.619
Anthony Taylor: now that we're here at the bottom, we can say, Do you want to play again, friends.

410
00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:01.109
Anthony Taylor: would you like to play again?

411
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:02.240
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

412
00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:11.019
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna hope they pick. Why, well, we could actually do per. Input

413
00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:14.630
Anthony Taylor: yeah, where I gear create a variable variable play again.

414
00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:19.060
Anthony Taylor: And then we're gonna set that equal to an input.

415
00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:22.500
Anthony Taylor: And in the input we're going to do type.

416
00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:25.760
Anthony Taylor: Why.

417
00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:31.529
Anthony Taylor: if yes, and that's all that really matters. You just need them to type. Y, yes.

418
00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:44.380
Anthony Taylor: okay. And they type anything else. It's over done alright. So now we have that we just need to do it. If condition to check if they type, yes or not, they're going to say, if play again.

419
00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:48.579
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna do dot lower. Anybody understand why we're gonna do dot lower?

420
00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:55.350
Mccanse, Meredith: Is that to capture in case they do uppercase or lower, it'll catch all of them.

421
00:37:55.850 --> 00:38:01.710
Anthony Taylor: So and then we can just say a lowercase. Y, and if they said, Yes.

422
00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:07.710
Anthony Taylor: we're just gonna break. Now, breaking this case means we're gonna break out

423
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:10.710
Anthony Taylor: of this. If Condition

424
00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:14.549
Anthony Taylor: see? We're inside of it, we're gonna break out of

425
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:16.730
Anthony Taylor: okay.

426
00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:22.809
Anthony Taylor: But remember, the first thing the Zip condition did was said, Hey, did they pick rock paper or scissor?

427
00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:23.900
Anthony Taylor: Well.

428
00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:28.159
Anthony Taylor: if they did not, we need to have it else

429
00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.069
Anthony Taylor: right here. So notice this else

430
00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:39.960
Anthony Taylor: definitely this, else. They're by this white line here. Well, it goes all up there, but it's tied to this. It see that?

431
00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:46.700
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we're going to hit. Enter. And then we're going to type friends.

432
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:49.190
Anthony Taylor: I don't understand.

433
00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:58.780
Anthony Taylor:  Next time choose

434
00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:05.280
Anthony Taylor: we'll just do it inside of here next time. Choose

435
00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:07.700
or

436
00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:11.380
Anthony Taylor: alright, don't don't hit it. Okay.

437
00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:23.580
Anthony Taylor: and that's it. That's all you really need. Let's run this says, pick rock paper scissor. I'm gonna pick rock. hit, enter. And then

438
00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:29.859
Anthony Taylor: it, didn't. It? Didn't say anything. Why.

439
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:34.139
Anthony Taylor: oh, no. we have a bug.

440
00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:37.460
Anthony Taylor: Let's try it again. Yes.

441
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:40.320
Anthony Taylor: make a choice. Let's do paper.

442
00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:45.670
Anthony Taylor: Oh, there they are!

443
00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:57.010
Anthony Taylor: Sorry. So when I chose rock computer chose paper, played again. I chose paper. They chose rock I want. Would you like to play again and enter, and so

444
00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:01.359
Anthony Taylor: pretty cool. You guys made a video game.

445
00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:07.369
Anthony Taylor: I love that you love that. Any questions about that.

446
00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:12.530
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

447
00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:24.620
Masarirambi, Rodney: So let's do some back to that to that lost. I have an error, and I just need to just see where it is, just at the bottom. That's great. Thank you. Oh, I just had an error. I just need to see. Where

448
00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:27.150
Masarirambi, Rodney: did I? There it is.

449
00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:30.219
Masarirambi, Rodney: I think that's it.

450
00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:36.879
Masarirambi, Rodney: Yep, thank you. Alright. II got it. Thank you. I love that good work. Yes, I

451
00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:50.539
sonja baro: good Meredith, could you explain again? You said the play again. Use the dot lower because we wanted to capture anything that they might put in there. Or in case they put a a capital Y,

452
00:40:50.630 --> 00:41:11.850
Mccanse, Meredith: yeah, because if they put so they're gonna put in an enter. They're gonna enter something for that question about do you wanna play again? So if they put a capital Y in the next step, it's gonna take whatever they put, and regardless of what they put it's gonna make it lower case. So if it was capital, it'll become lower case if they put in lower case. To begin with, it'll stay lower case.

453
00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:14.870
sonja baro: Great as a user. I love that. Thank you

454
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:22.100
Anthony Taylor: alright. So let's jump over to the slideshow again.

455
00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:24.999
Anthony Taylor: match case. So

456
00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:36.789
Anthony Taylor: they are kind of condo that checks which list this particular cases. And so Matt's case is a different way of doing it, if else, if else, if else, if else itself.

457
00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:39.500
Anthony Taylor: or if else, if else, if else, if Elsa

458
00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:49.419
Anthony Taylor: alright and we're gonna show you how it works, it's just a different way of doing it. It's really cool. It's possible you could do all you could do, both or or either.

459
00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:51.020
Anthony Taylor: And that's it.

460
00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:53.859
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so let me just show you

461
00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:55.750
Anthony Taylor: what it looks like.

462
00:41:58.960 --> 00:41:59.770
Anthony Taylor: So

463
00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:05.630
Anthony Taylor: here, our first cell, we're just going to create a Boolean.

464
00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:07.259
Anthony Taylor: and it's going to be true.

465
00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:12.679
Anthony Taylor: Then we have this interesting list of pie purchases.

466
00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:19.499
Anthony Taylor: How many do we have here? 12345678910.

467
00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:22.660
Anthony Taylor: So 0 through 9. Right

468
00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:31.149
Anthony Taylor: now we have a list of pies. Yes, 123-45-6789.

469
00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:34.090
Anthony Taylor: Ted. Okay.

470
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:41.089
Anthony Taylor: so here we're going to say, welcome to the house of pies. Here are our pies.

471
00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:48.330
Anthony Taylor: So that lists that out. And that's fine. But we need to show all of these different pie. So we're going to say.

472
00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:51.739
Anthony Taylor: we're basically going to take an order is what we're going to do.

473
00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:56.769
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we're gonna say, Wow, place order, work, place order is true.

474
00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:07.380
Anthony Taylor: France. 50 dashes by number, equals one for pi in pi list friends.

475
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:13.490
Anthony Taylor: pie number pi. and then add one to the pi number.

476
00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:15.290
Anthony Taylor: Does everybody follow that

477
00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.490
Anthony Taylor: for every pie in the split

478
00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:26.839
Anthony Taylor: France. the number which right now is one. and then the name of the pie. The first one will be kind of

479
00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:29.010
Anthony Taylor: okay.

480
00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:33.820
Clayton Graves: when it's done. Anyway, we I thought index was 0.

481
00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:41.849
Anthony Taylor: Index is 0. We're not good. But we don't want to tell our customer to order pi number 0.

482
00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:49.319
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we're gonna have to adjust for that in just a second. And we'll see that. So they're gonna we're gonna say, which one would you like.

483
00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:56.650
Anthony Taylor: they're going to type in a number. And then the first thing we're going to do is subtract that one out.

484
00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:08.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So now, if they chose number one. We're going to put 0 in there. Then we're going to. Here's that pie purchase and list. Remember this.

485
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:17.040
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're going to say I purchases the index. So let's stick with Pcan. 0

486
00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:23.269
Anthony Taylor: plus equals one. Which what's that mean? That means this value right here is going to become a one.

487
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:32.400
Anthony Taylor: Then we're going to say we're going to go. Put it, put some lines in great. We'll have that whatever the pie is out

488
00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:45.730
Anthony Taylor: right? Absolutely okay. And now it's still going, because, look, there's another while loop inside of this while loop. So now it's going to say, would you like some more? Yes or no

489
00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:51.189
Anthony Taylor: and then we're gonna do a match. And here's the new stuff you're gonna learn.

490
00:44:51.490 --> 00:45:05.909
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so match. It's going to look at this variable lowercase. If it is a yes. we want it to do something, if it is no, we want it to do something. If it's anything else, we want it to do something else.

491
00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:11.049
Anthony Taylor: So match. put in the variable you want to look at.

492
00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:18.150
Anthony Taylor: In our case it's keep ordering in a lower case. then we can do taste.

493
00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:21.790
Anthony Taylor: So all this is, what's that variable equal to?

494
00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:29.409
Anthony Taylor: In this case? It's equal, or we're checking for y if it equals y. we're going to

495
00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:36.019
Anthony Taylor: place the chair, keep place order equal to true, and then break. Now this break

496
00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:38.720
Anthony Taylor: is taking us out of this loop.

497
00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:42.389
Anthony Taylor: but and and taking us back to here.

498
00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:45.709
Anthony Taylor: It's going to go. Oh, it's still true. Go again.

499
00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:48.060
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

500
00:45:50.600 --> 00:46:00.459
Anthony Taylor: if they say no, we're gonna change place order, false print. Thank you for your order break. It's gonna come back up here. This is now false.

501
00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:02.060
Anthony Taylor: So it's gonna stop.

502
00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:12.610
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And then, lastly, if they don't quit yes or no, we don't know what you're talking about trying. Okay, so let's run this. See how it looks.

503
00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:23.139
Anthony Taylor: What would you like? Oh, guys, look at the list.  a.  I want a tamally by a month

504
00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:33.549
Anthony Taylor: and hit enter now, it says, would you like keep ordering? Let's put in capital y. That work. What would you like, but you can't pie. That's what.

505
00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:36.829
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now I want. I want to kill.

506
00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:40.400
Anthony Taylor: Show me variables right now, cause we're running

507
00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:42.969
Anthony Taylor: and no, I don't want to order any.

508
00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:48.169
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So now it's done.

509
00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:53.920
Anthony Taylor: and it says, Great! We'll have your tamale pie out for you. Great! We'll have your pecan pie out for you.

510
00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:56.559
Anthony Taylor: Now, if we look at that list.

511
00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:10.379
Anthony Taylor: this one, look at that. It's no longer 0, 0 0 0 for pecan pie. We ordered one for tamally pie. We ordered what? Everybody see that?

512
00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:15.169
Anthony Taylor: Good. Alright, the last step of this.

513
00:47:15.330 --> 00:47:20.660
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna print some pretty lines we're gonna say you purchase. Now we're gonna go through

514
00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:22.210
Anthony Taylor: the pie list.

515
00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:31.769
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So for index in the, you know, for every py list. we're going to go to the Pi count. That's this list of that's

516
00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:33.239
Anthony Taylor: where'd my pike count?

517
00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:43.009
Anthony Taylor: Oh, sorry. Pike counts the variable. We're gonna go to pike purchases, this guy.

518
00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:48.029
Anthony Taylor: and we're going to say, give me all those numbers, and then the name that goes with it.

519
00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:57.230
Anthony Taylor: and if that pi count is greater than or equal to one, we're going to print it out. That's it. So we run that we see. We ordered one pkan, one to mountain.

520
00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:01.580
Anthony Taylor: And that's it. Okay.

521
00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:04.260
Anthony Taylor: hey? Andy, there was a yeah go for it.

522
00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:10.149
Mccanse, Meredith: were there any. So I know this was already sort of in there, cause it's the solved one.

523
00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:18.319
Mccanse, Meredith: Were there any? Did you make any changes for it to be able to run like mine's erroring out. But I didn't make any changes.

524
00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:24.509
Mccanse, Meredith: Let me let me look. I don't. So this show me real quick. Let's see.

525
00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:26.989
Mccanse, Meredith: Okay, I don't think so, but maybe

526
00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:29.700
michael mcpherson: mine did the same.

527
00:48:30.350 --> 00:48:35.760
Anthony Taylor: Oh, oh, alright! Well, let's see what. Let me see what it is. So let's look at the error. First. Value error.

528
00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:41.870
Anthony Taylor: choice index pi choice. Add pi invalid literal int with base 10 apple

529
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:45.420
Anthony Taylor: scroll up

530
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:47.479
Mccanse, Meredith: Eastern Upper.

531
00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:51.949
Mccanse, Meredith: I'm not very good at reading. That's okay. Go all the way up.

532
00:48:52.610 --> 00:48:55.390
Anthony Taylor: Keep going all the way up.

533
00:48:57.270 --> 00:49:00.970
Anthony Taylor: So you got place order pi purchases alright. Now start scrolling down.

534
00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:02.000
Mccanse, Meredith: Okay?

535
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:05.749
Anthony Taylor: And let's look at this

536
00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:15.920
Anthony Taylor: pie number equals 100 pi and pylus pi number plus equals one pi choice. Input, would you like choice index int pi choice minus one.

537
00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:21.029
Anthony Taylor: I purchases choice index. Print 50 print great.

538
00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:25.030
Anthony Taylor: Well, wait. You copy this. No, this is not the one you copy. Keep going

539
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:29.809
Anthony Taylor: alright. Let me see where that error was. Again.

540
00:49:29.890 --> 00:49:36.010
Mccanse, Meredith: I think it's it. I think it's this line, but I'm not positive, so it says

541
00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:39.850
Mccanse, Meredith: that little green arrow is pointing to that one choice index. Yes.

542
00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:44.509
Anthony Taylor: invalid literal for int with base 10 apple.

543
00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:52.030
Anthony Taylor: I go back up. It sounds like you're it's trying to pick the pi name, not the pi integer. Okay, stop here.

544
00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:57.780
Anthony Taylor: Int pi choice. What did you type in the pi choice, the number or the word.

545
00:49:57.910 --> 00:50:04.620
Mccanse, Meredith: It never asked me. It just said what kind of high? And I said, Apple, and then I didn't get any other questions.

546
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:06.350
Anthony Taylor: Hit run again.

547
00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:07.440
Mccanse, Meredith: Okay.

548
00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:10.429
Derek Rikke: type the number of the pie.

549
00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:14.109
Anthony Taylor: So scroll down, and you'll see the list of pies

550
00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:18.950
Mccanse, Meredith: down here in the in the but in the up above.

551
00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:22.750
Mccanse, Meredith: So in here. Scroll down.

552
00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:26.879
Anthony Taylor: Keep going right there. See those numbers? That's what it wants you to select.

553
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:29.390
Mccanse, Meredith: Oh, okay.

554
00:50:30.130 --> 00:50:31.940
Mccanse, Meredith: So if I said, 8

555
00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:35.850
Anthony Taylor: enter. And then, now, do you want to keep going, or are you dead?

556
00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:38.259
Anthony Taylor: You did it

557
00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:39.829
Mccanse, Meredith: did good, and

558
00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:45.220
Anthony Taylor: that's why that's really easy to exercise, Mike.

559
00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:46.770
Mccanse, Meredith: Sorry.

560
00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:47.979
Anthony Taylor: No, go ahead.

561
00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:53.900
Mccanse, Meredith: No, I just it's really easy to miss, or just sort of not understand what's happening in the

562
00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:58.690
Anthony Taylor: well, that's why you want to follow through it. Actually so

563
00:51:00.310 --> 00:51:13.930
Anthony Taylor: hand broke my desk in same moment. That was pretty good.  let me try something also. This is also one place where you might want to look it and say that when you're programming, you want to make sure that you

564
00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:17.440
Masarirambi, Rodney: are very explicit about what you're asking the person to do.

565
00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:38.549
Masarirambi, Rodney: because the first thing that I saw was like when did the first exercise was? There's no, there's no dial sign, or there's no monetary symbol. So I was like, Oh, do we put it in or not? I just happen to not put it in. But I think that's where, like as as a coder, we need to be more explicit to be like, hey? And then takes work out for the for the users. One of the customers

566
00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:43.500
Anthony Taylor: I agree. That is an excellent statement.

567
00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:46.129
Anthony Taylor:  me check something

568
00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:50.970
Anthony Taylor: and see us hope. Let me do it. Nevermind.

569
00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:52.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay,

570
00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:57.730
Anthony Taylor: that didn't work

571
00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:00.090
Anthony Taylor: alright.

572
00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:04.519
Anthony Taylor: So I mean, the bottom line is is, you can add, like print statements

573
00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:14.149
Anthony Taylor: in here to like, see the variables so you could say every time you change something you could say, you know. Show me this list

574
00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:18.439
Anthony Taylor: right here to see it increment, or you could use variables down below

575
00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:24.240
Anthony Taylor: and watch it go up as you do it. There's a lot of things. And I mean, these aren't really.

576
00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:31.830
Anthony Taylor: This isn't really a good place to debug like that. But we could. Okay,

577
00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:35.480
Anthony Taylor: don't want. Don't want you to worry about yet.

578
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:41.030
Anthony Taylor: Let's do a few more, and before we're done you'll be better at troubleshooting. Okay.

579
00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:45.750
Anthony Taylor: if this is just like the first. This is mostly I just wanted to show you this match case.

580
00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:47.590
Mccanse, Meredith: Thank you.

581
00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:52.090
Anthony Taylor: So no, don't worry. Alright. But here I am going to give you let you try it.

582
00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:58.949
Anthony Taylor: So what I want you to do is go into rock paper scissors. We're gonna give you all of the code already done.

584
00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:05.109
Anthony Taylor: darn it.

585
00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:08.690
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So go into that code right now, real quick.

586
00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:17.390
Anthony Taylor: And I'm going to give you a new cell. And I want you to just copy this out of slack

587
00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:20.850
Anthony Taylor: and put it in there. Okay.

588
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:31.409
Anthony Taylor: and a lot of these today. So pay. So that cell. I want you to go into your notebook.

589
00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:40.620
Anthony Taylor: and 1, 2, 3, 4 down. Make a new code cell and paste everything. I just gave you

590
00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:42.250
Anthony Taylor: alright.

591
00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:48.389
Anthony Taylor: and then just delete the ones below it. Just delete them, delete them, delete them, delete them

592
00:53:48.730 --> 00:53:50.180
Anthony Taylor: filatem filatem.

593
00:53:50.210 --> 00:53:51.830
Anthony Taylor: You can leave that one.

594
00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:58.360
sonja baro: but you didn't change anything on that, Anthony, from your previous post.

595
00:53:59.470 --> 00:54:03.460
sonja baro: the one I just gave you. Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, this is well.

596
00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:06.750
sonja baro: You just you.

597
00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:18.010
sonja baro: You already had posted all this in live. And now, if you've already done it, I guess, is the question. Doing repo re pace. No, look, look, look! Look about so there's 2 of them there.

598
00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:19.439
Anthony Taylor: there's one

599
00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:26.670
Anthony Taylor: that's telling you. Since you basically, I'm trying to give you the completed code. And you're gonna refactor it.

600
00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:34.340
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But you're gonna use Max, Kate, you guys are going to use Max case instead of this of If Ellen.

601
00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:36.910
Anthony Taylor: okay.

602
00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:40.100
sonja baro: am I sharing my screen? I am right. Yeah.

603
00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:46.759
Mccanse, Meredith: Again, where we paste, where we need to paste it.

604
00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:50.219
Anthony Taylor: Here. I'm gonna I'm gonna delete. I'm gonna cancel what I did.

605
00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:53.680
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna open it again because I should've caught this earlier.

606
00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:56.539
Alright. So right here under options.

607
00:54:56.760 --> 00:55:00.300
Anthony Taylor: click code. And then just paste

608
00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:07.239
Anthony Taylor: and then just delete everything underneath. There you can just click the cell delete, click the cell delete.

609
00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:11.100
Anthony Taylor: Okay. you don't need any of this stuff

610
00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:14.930
Mccanse, Meredith: so we're in match case. We're not in Rob Cooper scissor.

611
00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:18.060
Anthony Taylor: You're in RPS. Match case

612
00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:20.549
Anthony Taylor: exercise 3 unsolved.

613
00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:25.390
Anthony Taylor: and all you have to do in this exercise

614
00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:30.450
sonja baro: is, follow these things. Sorry. Keep going.

615
00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:38.800
Anthony Taylor: this couple. Here, here's the exercise. Here's the instructions. But basically, if you go look in the notebook, it has the instructions there, too.

616
00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:41.700
Anthony Taylor: Okay, the most important thing.

617
00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:46.740
Anthony Taylor: Use match case instead of if else? If so, what does that mean?

618
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:55.339
Anthony Taylor: So that means you're basically going to do like match. And then put in the the variable

619
00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:58.140
Anthony Taylor: okay? And

620
00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:07.069
Anthony Taylor: then you say, well, Case, if this do that. so let me just give you a little more of an example. So you're gonna do match use choice

621
00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:08.620
Anthony Taylor: case. R.

622
00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:17.119
Anthony Taylor: So this will be the first thing you're gonna do. You're gonna change them all to rock paper scissors. Remember the whole word like we did in the first one, and you can go back and look at the first one.

623
00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:29.609
Anthony Taylor: And then after you get to use your choice. you can do case R match computer choice case, P case, S, and do it. Yeah, I'll give you the first asset.

624
00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:32.679
Anthony Taylor: I'm just gonna give you the first one

625
00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:36.039
Anthony Taylor: because I don't. I don't. I don't think that is, this is

626
00:56:37.530 --> 00:56:40.009
Anthony Taylor: as easy as they want it to be.

627
00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:44.250
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So basically.

628
00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:51.079
Anthony Taylor: this is the first one. Okay, so match user choice.

629
00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:57.200
Anthony Taylor: If they pick R, we're going to check the computer choice.

630
00:56:57.320 --> 00:57:01.610
Anthony Taylor: If they pick P, we say, the computer chose paper you lose.

631
00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:06.320
Anthony Taylor: If they pick S, the computer chose scissors you lose.

632
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:07.530
Anthony Taylor: are you with?

633
00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:13.680
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Then we're gonna do another case just like this. In fact, you could even copy this.

634
00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:16.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I would copy from the side.

635
00:57:18.570 --> 00:57:21.160
Anthony Taylor: Okay. to hear.

636
00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:24.179
Anthony Taylor: and you could paste it.

637
00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:32.769
Anthony Taylor: But this time, instead of R, we're going to change it to P. Okay? And then just change these as well.

638
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:39.090
Anthony Taylor: So you're gonna do R, and and and change the print and s and change the print.

639
00:57:39.830 --> 00:57:41.330
Anthony Taylor: Hang on, be but

640
00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:46.059
Anthony Taylor:  and take guys

641
00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:53.080
Anthony Taylor: so you can do the last one alright. There's only one more you gotta do, and you can do the first one

642
00:57:53.260 --> 00:58:01.739
Anthony Taylor: I'll give you, I'll give you the first example of the first one. Then you take it from there. So here, they just wanted you to do this part.

643
00:58:04.410 --> 00:58:06.879
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so you got to do the other 2

644
00:58:07.610 --> 00:58:12.689
Anthony Taylor: got it. Everybody pretty comfortable. Do you want me to give you this wholesale I just made?

645
00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:17.140
Anthony Taylor: I bet you do. I'm okay with that

646
00:58:17.310 --> 00:58:20.789
Anthony Taylor: cause. I think you guys are doing great.

647
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:26.079
Anthony Taylor: Here you go. Aye. Hi, guys, I'm gonna give you

648
00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:30.979
Anthony Taylor: 10 min to knock this out.

649
00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:35.350
Anthony Taylor: and that's it. Alright.

650
00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:51.129
Anthony Taylor: Just stay, hold on, let me go ahead and record. I love recording when I ask if something's confusing. Was that confusing? Did you guys have a tough time with that? I think some did. I think most of you did. And that's my fault. I'm gonna take the plane for that. And here's why

651
00:58:51.330 --> 00:58:59.689
Anthony Taylor: I should have just left it alone and made you figure it out and just gave you more time. Okay, by giving you this code. I think I actually made it harder for

652
00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:04.910
Anthony Taylor: alright cause you you like. Well, what do I do? I just got this code now, what?

653
00:59:04.990 --> 00:59:07.409
Anthony Taylor: Well, you needed to make one more case.

654
00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:12.600
Anthony Taylor: I get it. It wasn't. It was not obvious.

655
00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:17.460
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but we'll make one more case, and I'll show you exactly how I would have done it, and you could have done it this way.

656
00:59:18.790 --> 00:59:19.790
Anthony Taylor: Thanks.

657
00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:24.279
Anthony Taylor: We're missing the case, or says

658
00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:34.419
Anthony Taylor: exactly exactly. So. If you copy there. Come here and paste it. Change this to sit to S.

659
00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:41.830
Anthony Taylor: And then see scissors does not beat rock. So there you go, but

660
00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:51.269
Anthony Taylor: it does be paper, and that's done. The one up above. I gave you rock. I was hoping that you would have done

661
00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:54.899
Anthony Taylor: the the next 2

662
00:59:58.930 --> 00:59:59.700
Anthony Taylor: oops.

663
00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:03.589
Anthony Taylor: Watch your indentation when you pace. So you would have done

664
01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:04.940
Anthony Taylor: paper.

665
01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:07.490
Anthony Taylor: paper

666
01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:09.890
Anthony Taylor: scissor.

667
01:00:11.830 --> 01:00:12.810
Anthony Taylor: scissor!

668
01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:25.480
Anthony Taylor: This is not your fault if I would have gave you that. I think I think you guys would at least ask, you know, would have at least tried this part, and you would have managed to pull the correct answer out of my butt there, for I love that.

669
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.779
Anthony Taylor: Well, wait! I don't know if I love it so much now that it came out.

670
01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:32.010
Anthony Taylor: but

671
01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:35.850
Anthony Taylor: this is going to fail. So anyway,

672
01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:46.689
Anthony Taylor: so yeah. So maybe next time I'll give you less code and and we'll just come in and help you guys get it started in. Okay, but don't sweat it.

673
01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:59.440
Anthony Taylor: You're gonna be fine. We have lots more practice of this stuff. Okay.  I think I'm going to give us a break right now.

674
01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:06.300
Anthony Taylor: I have so much craziness going on, and it's distracting. So I want to stop being distracted. So

675
01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:14.030
Anthony Taylor: let me give you guys your break. I'll see you at 8. Hi. and we'll start dictionaries. How excited that.

676
01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:17.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay, see you in 15 on track here.

677
01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:21.100
Anthony Taylor: dictionaries.

678
01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:28.550
Anthony Taylor: So start with this one.

679
01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:33.110
Anthony Taylor:  we've talked about lists

680
01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:37.319
Anthony Taylor: right? And in this we can have multiple data types.

681
01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:44.100
Anthony Taylor: right? And there you can tell, it's a list because they have square bracket there.

682
01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:45.790
Anthony Taylor: Thank you.

683
01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:51.480
Anthony Taylor: Kevin. Thank you.  the

684
01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:55.699
Anthony Taylor: a list is an index

685
01:01:55.910 --> 01:02:10.449
Anthony Taylor: list. When we say list, we just assume indexed. which means it's 0 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. Okay. a tuple. Just it's just like a list. There's really nothing say about it other than it's immutable. We can't change

686
01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:15.350
Anthony Taylor: we've talked about other data types. But today we're gonna talk about

687
01:02:15.490 --> 01:02:29.220
Anthony Taylor: probably the most versatile of the data types. And as a data person and a data scientist, which is really what AI is gonna be right? Because data science is basically a subset of AI

688
01:02:29.930 --> 01:02:34.209
Anthony Taylor:  dictionaries are the most flexible. Yeah game.

689
01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:41.760
Vasquez, Gabriel: Why do they call them dictionaries when they kind of the same as an object?

690
01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:46.759
Anthony Taylor: You mean a Json object? Because dictionaries came before Json.

691
01:02:47.490 --> 01:03:02.190
Anthony Taylor: No, the truth is, is, and you're gonna find as we go through this, the syntax is remarkably similar. There are a few subtle differences. The most important one is, python doesn't recognize a Json object in that way.

692
01:03:03.030 --> 01:03:05.729
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But it does recognize addiction.

693
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:10.810
Anthony Taylor: But you're right. It's Json. Object is a key value pair and a dictionary is key value pairs.

694
01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:11.810
Anthony Taylor: So

695
01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:15.359
Anthony Taylor: it's addiction in python, we call it addiction.

696
01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:23.620
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, that's it. So the dictionary is wrapped in curly brackets. So anytime. You see that

697
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:27.250
Anthony Taylor: you know right away you have addiction. Okay.

698
01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:34.460
Anthony Taylor: there's 2 ways to create it. This creates an empty one, and this creates an empty one exactly the same.

699
01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:47.150
Anthony Taylor: This is way easier to read. Okay. so what do I mean by key value pairs? Well, kind of exactly what it sounds like a dictionary, will have a key.

700
01:03:47.530 --> 01:03:50.280
Anthony Taylor: then a colon. and then a value.

701
01:03:52.050 --> 01:03:53.439
Anthony Taylor: Now that value

702
01:03:53.670 --> 01:04:04.010
Anthony Taylor: could be a string integer, a float, a list, another dictionary, another dictionary containing a string, an integer, a list, another dictionary, and etc.

703
01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:10.240
Anthony Taylor: In its most simplest form it is a key and a value.

704
01:04:11.710 --> 01:04:14.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so here we have a dictionary.

705
01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:17.290
Anthony Taylor: the key. his name.

706
01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:20.709
Anthony Taylor: the value down to Zip.

707
01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:25.800
Anthony Taylor: If we want to see what the value of the key is.

708
01:04:26.810 --> 01:04:29.040
Anthony Taylor: we type actor.

709
01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:33.269
Anthony Taylor: let me be more precise, the name of the dictionary.

710
01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:35.570
Anthony Taylor: In our case it's actors.

711
01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:40.999
Anthony Taylor: and then in brackets we type the key.

712
01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:44.960
Anthony Taylor: and then that will return the value

713
01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:46.319
Anthony Taylor: just like that.

714
01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:49.700
Anthony Taylor: Is that super clear to everybody?

715
01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:56.680
Anthony Taylor: Cool? So here one of the things that we love? Yes, Curry.

716
01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:02.729
Gardner, Curry: Sorry, is it like a map and other programming languages

717
01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:05.240
Anthony Taylor: like, or is it different?

718
01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:07.690
Gardner, Curry: A dictionary? Is it like a map?

719
01:05:07.790 --> 01:05:11.710
Anthony Taylor: It's it's more like a Json object than anything I don't know

720
01:05:11.830 --> 01:05:16.360
Anthony Taylor: if other programming languages are using it as a calling in the map. But

721
01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:22.049
Anthony Taylor: if you've used Json like like Dave did the full stack they use Json like crazy.

722
01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:26.870
Anthony Taylor: Okay, maybe in Matlab, or something they call it that

723
01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.000
Anthony Taylor: I'd have to look it up myself.

724
01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:31.389
Anthony Taylor: But okay, so

725
01:05:31.590 --> 01:05:43.049
Anthony Taylor: one of the fun things about addiction is to add a value to it. We can call the dictionary call a T,

726
01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:45.900
Anthony Taylor: we're just going to update it. Actually, this particular one.

727
01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:58.950
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then we can passing value. So now you can see our dictionary changed to that one, and if we print the whole dictionary, we'll see, there's the key. There's the new battle.

728
01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:07.030
Anthony Taylor: If we just want the name, we can just say, print dictionary brackets the key.

729
01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:09.060
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

730
01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:13.099
Anthony Taylor: yeah. But but we got 2.

731
01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:16.629
Clayton Graves: Never mind, I just needed to be patient.

732
01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:19.739
Anthony Taylor: I love that sign. Yeah.

733
01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:25.570
sonja baro: Where I was confused is, I thought.

734
01:06:25.830 --> 01:06:27.710
sonja baro: won't you want to add

735
01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:36.350
sonja baro: Denzel to the list of Amazing Clayton's talking about. So I'm gonna show you how to do that. Don't worry.

736
01:06:36.590 --> 01:06:48.610
sonja baro: So when yeah, yeah, when you went key. So you said, Okay, add an actor. So by definition.

737
01:06:48.910 --> 01:07:04.389
Anthony Taylor: they didn't add it. They this, I read it, and I was like, that's wrong. No, if you just if you have a dictionary and it has a team called name and you pass it to single value. It's gonna overwrite that key. Exactly. This is this is, this is

738
01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:05.750
sonja baro: wrong.

739
01:07:06.610 --> 01:07:11.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay, cool. No. And that's good. That. And I read it too. I'm like, add an act like no one.

740
01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:14.180
Anthony Taylor: But yeah.

741
01:07:14.310 --> 01:07:20.210
Anthony Taylor: So here's a list of actors. Boom, boom, cruise, Angela Christie suit Denzil Washington.

742
01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:26.250
Anthony Taylor: and we're going to add to the name key.

743
01:07:26.330 --> 01:07:27.740
Anthony Taylor: This list.

744
01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:32.719
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Now I want to show you those variables again, so you can see what just happened.

745
01:07:32.890 --> 01:07:44.589
Anthony Taylor: So we have the actors list. But now look at our dictionary. Our dictionary has a name, Colon. So that's the key name. The value is this entire list?

746
01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:47.800
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

747
01:07:48.730 --> 01:07:58.050
Anthony Taylor: So to call a single item in the list. How would I if I just let's go back to where we made the list. Oh, is where we made the list. So how would I get Angelina? Jolie?

748
01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:04.939
Anthony Taylor: That's right, son. Type one.

749
01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:09.440
Anthony Taylor: She said it. I just that. She just is on mute when she said it.

750
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.909
Anthony Taylor: Okay, right? So that's how we would do it. So in a dictionary. It's not much different.

751
01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:17.320
Anthony Taylor: We're going to say dictionary, name

752
01:08:18.109 --> 01:08:24.219
Anthony Taylor: key in brackets. Oh, that's where we assign me dictionary name key in brackets.

753
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:26.470
Anthony Taylor: And then the index

754
01:08:26.710 --> 01:08:31.480
Anthony Taylor: of the item in the list. So in this case, we're going to get Tom Cruise

755
01:08:32.050 --> 01:08:36.249
Anthony Taylor: because he was the first item in the list. Yeah, I'm married.

756
01:08:37.390 --> 01:08:39.350
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Why do you have to put

757
01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:57.960
Anthony Taylor: if you're saying what the dictionary's name is? Wouldn't it already know what the key is? Why do you have to tell it. The key dictionaries can have thousands of keys, can have hundreds of thousands of keys. But I have dictionaries that I work with

758
01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.210
Anthony Taylor: in the hundreds of keys.

759
01:09:00.779 --> 01:09:06.250
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. And some of them are nested. So they have more keys inside of the keys. It's very exciting.

760
01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:08.439
Anthony Taylor: Was that your question, Clayton?

761
01:09:09.569 --> 01:09:12.180
Anthony Taylor: Great minds think alike.

762
01:09:13.270 --> 01:09:17.209
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And no, not like a hass map. That's is that

763
01:09:17.229 --> 01:09:19.369
Anthony Taylor: okay? Anyway, let's continue.

764
01:09:19.410 --> 01:09:25.770
Anthony Taylor: Fine. Okay, so here we have a dictionary. Now, notice.

765
01:09:25.819 --> 01:09:34.560
Anthony Taylor: There are 3 keys in the dictionary. Everybody see that name genre nationality.

766
01:09:35.250 --> 01:09:40.719
Anthony Taylor: Each have a value, and each one is accessible through the methods that we've learned

767
01:09:41.569 --> 01:09:50.039
Anthony Taylor: so you could come in here and say, you know, actress bracket genre here, just do that right here, so we'll say,

768
01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:52.069
Actress

769
01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:59.670
Anthony Taylor: bracket genre. and just run that. And we see it returns action.

770
01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:09.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Another cool thing about notebooks is you don't always have to put a print there. You can. Just sometimes you can just type a variable and it'll show it to you.

771
01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.230
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

772
01:10:12.670 --> 01:10:16.730
Anthony Taylor: so okay, now, here's an interesting one. This thing nested

773
01:10:17.310 --> 01:10:22.139
Anthony Taylor: dictionary. Okay. So here we have the name of the dictionary.

774
01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:30.140
Anthony Taylor: We know because it's curly breakfast inside of it. We have a key for name, age, married best movie.

775
01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:37.280
Anthony Taylor: And in best movies is a list with 3 values in

776
01:10:38.890 --> 01:10:41.560
Anthony Taylor: alright. And so we can say, print

777
01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:49.470
Anthony Taylor: another app. So this is the inside curly brackets. So this is an F string. So it's going to go up here. Go to this dictionary

778
01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:56.720
Anthony Taylor: and get the value of the name key, Sylvester Stallone. and he was in dictionary.

779
01:10:57.670 --> 01:11:02.430
Anthony Taylor: The key value 0, which is rocky.

780
01:11:02.850 --> 01:11:04.539
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

781
01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:06.529
Anthony Taylor: so that's Slogan's Iraq.

782
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:16.850
Anthony Taylor: Here's another cool one. This one is a dictionary. But look at this. There's another dictionary inside

783
01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:21.329
Anthony Taylor: of the dictionary, you see why we said today was complex data types.

784
01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:27.240
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this can go on forever. So key title, key revenue.

785
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:36.480
Anthony Taylor: new Dictionary, Key, United States Key, China Key, United Kingdom. Now, to get to these, we have to call this key.

786
01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:46.250
Anthony Taylor: So here you can see film we call title made Phil revenues. United States.

787
01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:50.329
Anthony Taylor: and that will return 360 million.

788
01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:55.420
Anthony Taylor: Okay, yeah, I see how we got there.

789
01:11:56.510 --> 01:12:00.489
Anthony Taylor: I think this one's going well, I can tell by looking at Gel's faces. This one's going well.

790
01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:04.659
Anthony Taylor: good, good, good! Oh, and let's see.

791
01:12:05.770 --> 01:12:09.160
Anthony Taylor: So those are dictionaries. Those aren't so bad. Right?

792
01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:15.750
Mason, Natalie: Can you just scroll back up and just go right over this 1 one more time.

793
01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:20.230
Anthony Taylor: Absolutely. So we have a dictionary. It has an inside dictionary.

794
01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:27.849
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And we're gonna call this key to get interstellar. And then we're gonna call

795
01:12:28.210 --> 01:12:40.830
Anthony Taylor: this key, which opens us up to this dictionary. and we want the United States value. So we have to pass in that key. So we have dictionary revenues, new dictionary.

796
01:12:40.850 --> 01:12:42.979
Anthony Taylor: United States. And that's it.

797
01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:46.580
Anthony Taylor: Cool. Yes, Sony.

798
01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:59.299
sonja baro: So I'm thinking of how we apply this like. So when you're into the future, when we're doing a project with data. And this is labeled data, right? Or structured data.

799
01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:05.969
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, well, actually, dictionaries and stuff are considered semi structured. But anyway, go ahead.

800
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:20.700
sonja baro: Okay, I'll stick with labeled, How's that? My question is or would. Seems like it would be helpful to know in like, when you get the requirements, what the variables are that you're needing

801
01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:25.189
sonja baro: in order to do all this right and to have it working.

802
01:13:25.890 --> 01:13:33.400
sonja baro: Yeah, if you're doing a project for a like a business unit, you you either. Somebody.

803
01:13:33.790 --> 01:13:45.370
Anthony Taylor: Usually the data analyst would create a mapping document. and it would say, Hey, in this output, I need, you know, this column, this column. We're having this problem right now.

804
01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:57.419
Anthony Taylor: It's one of those if I could, if I was on my workup to show you we're we're pulling it Json data for Gabe. But in Python. We treat Json data as a dictionary.

805
01:13:57.850 --> 01:13:59.740
Anthony Taylor: And it has

806
01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:11.960
Anthony Taylor: like 300 options in it. Okay? And we've told the marketing group, we're like, hey guys. We're not just going to give you 300 freaking columns. You're gonna have to tell us what you want.

807
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:19.069
Anthony Taylor: And they're very. They're heavily missed. They're heavily missed like some of them, 1012 deep.

808
01:14:19.570 --> 01:14:23.950
Anthony Taylor: So so, yeah, so we just we were just meeting with them today, saying, Look.

809
01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:26.370
Anthony Taylor: you need to go back to drawing board. You got to do this.

810
01:14:26.530 --> 01:14:29.490
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Yes, Rodney.

811
01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:36.920
Masarirambi, Rodney: So in terms of. And actually, you might have just answered it with that story.

812
01:14:36.970 --> 01:14:40.200
Masarirambi, Rodney: So for the nested. What

813
01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:46.209
Masarirambi, Rodney: is there best practice for? How deep you nest your dictionary like cause?

814
01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:49.640
Anthony Taylor: This is why we love dictionaries

815
01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:54.469
Masarirambi, Rodney: just as long as you understand? It's all grid.

816
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:56.710
Anthony Taylor: you know. Most time you don't understand.

817
01:14:58.030 --> 01:15:04.980
Anthony Taylor: you know. Seriously, II have. Okay. So any of you ever heard of product called workfront made by adobe.

818
01:15:06.050 --> 01:15:13.050
Anthony Taylor: No. Okay. So in this product, the user gets to, you know, the user group, they get to add

819
01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:17.370
Anthony Taylor: custom fields into their pages. They're working. It's basically projecting.

820
01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:23.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But they add custom fields. Well, these custom fields get added to a dictionary

821
01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:26.469
Anthony Taylor: all right, depending on how they add them.

822
01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:34.130
Anthony Taylor: They could be a dictionary in a dictionary, a list in a dictionary, a dictionary in a dictionary, with a list inside of it, and so on. And so

823
01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:39.229
Anthony Taylor: this one table has few 100 of these.

824
01:15:39.690 --> 01:15:43.720
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And we don't know, and they can add them anytime they want.

825
01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:49.849
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So the next time we go pull the data, just be there, and we got to know how to handle it.

826
01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:55.079
Anthony Taylor: So it's one of the the flexibilities of a dictionary is. I can put

827
01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:00.820
Anthony Taylor: in a table in a data table. I can put this in a color

828
01:16:02.130 --> 01:16:03.310
Anthony Taylor: all by itself.

829
01:16:04.330 --> 01:16:10.899
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And when I put this in the column all by itself. If it grows it doesn't matter the column.

830
01:16:11.130 --> 01:16:17.359
Anthony Taylor: The value of the column is a dictionary. They can get bigger or smaller, and it doesn't affect your data.

831
01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:26.559
Anthony Taylor: Alright. There's a lot of advantages to a dictionary. And or a Json object. We're going to always call them dictionaries, because we are python

832
01:16:26.610 --> 01:16:29.430
Anthony Taylor: people, not Javascript people. Gabe?

833
01:16:30.570 --> 01:16:32.709
Anthony Taylor: Alright christine questioned.

834
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:43.340
Kanouff, Christine: I guess I just looking at that same film. What if there like? Would it be another another nested dictionary. If there were multiple

835
01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:45.750
Kanouff, Christine: titles of films you were looking at.

836
01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:54.169
Anthony Taylor: No, it would be another object. Actually, yeah, I'll show you that. What was, I think genres.

837
01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:56.970
Anthony Taylor: Right? So maybe genre

838
01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:58.420
Anthony Taylor: is a list.

839
01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:04.500
Anthony Taylor: right? This is all the genres that this movie is in Interstellar thriller

840
01:17:06.670 --> 01:17:08.010
space.

841
01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:10.680
Anthony Taylor: Oscar Winner

842
01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:12.670
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Science fiction

843
01:17:13.010 --> 01:17:16.309
Anthony Taylor: science fiction. Oh, my God, yeah, I miss that one.

844
01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:20.140
Anthony Taylor: Interstellar was funny.

845
01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:24.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay, well, that's okay. So but here you can see.

846
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:34.920
Anthony Taylor: So now we have a list and a dictionary, and on top of that we could put I mean, I. This would make sense here. But I could actually put a list inside of this dictionary

847
01:17:35.470 --> 01:17:40.960
Anthony Taylor: with a key. It's very, very, very versatile.

848
01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:42.500
Anthony Taylor: So

849
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:51.129
Anthony Taylor: they answer Christine's question, which was an excellent question, well, what if I have 2 films. Well, in that case you would need to do

850
01:17:52.570 --> 01:17:57.470
Anthony Taylor: and create a new object and start over again.

851
01:18:00.670 --> 01:18:04.629
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And you would start with, you know, where

852
01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:07.659
Anthony Taylor: stuff like that.

853
01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:11.529
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And and inside of there you would just keep.

854
01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:17.650
Anthony Taylor: Now let me ask you this question. I'm gonna do Star Wars, and then I'm gonna do.

855
01:18:17.730 --> 01:18:18.940
Anthony Taylor: Maine

856
01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:28.440
Anthony Taylor: character actually don't put spaces in your keys. That's bad practice. Okay? And then I'm gonna say, Luke

857
01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:32.690
Anthony Taylor: depends on the Star wars. And I'm just gonna stop right there.

858
01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:35.829
Anthony Taylor: Will that work?

859
01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:47.279
Anthony Taylor: What do you guys think? I don't see? But yeah, Gabe knows. Gabe knows. Okay, this is what we call why, we call this a semi semi structure.

860
01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:52.920
Anthony Taylor: I don't actually have to have exactly the same keys in every object.

861
01:18:53.970 --> 01:18:56.540
Anthony Taylor: and I can still call them all film.

862
01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:10.009
Anthony Taylor: Which is why we love dictionaries, because they're very versatile. Now, when you're doing like data analytics and the data science side of stuff dictionaries aren't so exciting. But as a data engineer, data

863
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:14.220
Anthony Taylor: data engineer and data scientists, they're very handy to have, because you can

864
01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:18.290
Anthony Taylor: really twist up things and do some fun stuff. Yeah. Ryan.

865
01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:30.820
Masarirambi, Rodney: looking at the christine's example, we changed genre from well, we added the list. Do you? You changed genre from

866
01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:46.460
Anthony Taylor: from a dictionary into a, from a well key into list. But so how the value is a list? O, how do you call that? Then the calling of it

867
01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:47.870
Anthony Taylor: like we did it here.

868
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:52.389
Anthony Taylor: So here we said, best movies. And that returned the list.

869
01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:55.349
Anthony Taylor: And then we said, Just give me the 0 item.

870
01:19:56.770 --> 01:19:58.110
Masarirambi, Rodney: Miss Adam. Thank you.

871
01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:00.060
Anthony Taylor: No, no problem.

872
01:20:00.970 --> 01:20:05.869
Anthony Taylor: Th. And and that's what today's about. We're going to do more of this. Don't worry. Here's another.

873
01:20:05.950 --> 01:20:06.960
Anthony Taylor: What is this one.

874
01:20:10.230 --> 01:20:18.750
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So here's some more fun stuff. So this other notebook inside the instructor dictionaries, here's a really good dictionary object.

875
01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:30.769
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we've got title. We've got multiple directors, multiple people in the cast. We've got box office and millions is another is a nested dictionary.

876
01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:34.160
Anthony Taylor: Release dates is a nested dictionary.

877
01:20:34.670 --> 01:20:40.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Lots of fun stuff. So it says, if we don't know all the queues in the dictionary, what could we do?

878
01:20:40.850 --> 01:20:43.230
Anthony Taylor: Well, somebody, I think, mentioned that earlier.

879
01:20:43.530 --> 01:20:51.919
Anthony Taylor: right. We can actually call the dictionary and do the method keys with open and close parentheses.

880
01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:56.400
Anthony Taylor: and that will tell us all of the keys available

881
01:20:56.690 --> 01:21:05.879
Anthony Taylor: at the root level of this dictionary. What does that mean? So did it tell me these keys?

882
01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:12.110
Anthony Taylor: Let's look again. Nope. box office and millions.

883
01:21:12.370 --> 01:21:14.579
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. But these new

884
01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:16.100
Anthony Taylor: release date.

885
01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:25.749
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. But these. Nope. okay, it tells me the keys at the root level at the base level of the object.

886
01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:31.439
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, we may just want the values, all of the values to be all of them.

887
01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:38.629
Anthony Taylor: Okay, again, these are gonna now you're gonna see all of the values because some of them were lists

888
01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:42.349
Anthony Taylor: right? Some of them

889
01:21:42.830 --> 01:21:45.550
Anthony Taylor: scroll were

890
01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:47.770
Anthony Taylor: dictionaries.

891
01:21:49.570 --> 01:21:53.010
Anthony Taylor: You're gonna see them all. But you're also gonna see the keys inside it.

892
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:56.989
Anthony Taylor: So to get keys, keys.

893
01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:59.299
Anthony Taylor: values dot them.

894
01:22:02.570 --> 01:22:09.499
Anthony Taylor: We can also get a tuple of each key value pair

895
01:22:10.350 --> 01:22:16.959
Anthony Taylor: so we can print like this. And this gives us title. Everything all at once.

896
01:22:17.330 --> 01:22:18.819
Anthony Taylor: See how it's a tuple

897
01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:25.380
Anthony Taylor: director. That whole list got it?

898
01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:32.809
Anthony Taylor:  So let's yeah assign you

899
01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:40.649
sonja baro: so on the tuple thing, right? You. But you didn't tell it to to bring.

900
01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:44.950
sonja baro: How did it know to bring back a list that can't be changed?

901
01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:49.249
sonja baro: Right? Cause it's not the whole. That's the turn of the message.

902
01:22:49.290 --> 01:23:02.930
Anthony Taylor: So remember this. These things. Anytime you see me write like a data type, and then a dot, and then a method which means it has parentheses like this. Okay, the the return type is is determined by the method, not by me.

903
01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:06.490
sonja baro: Okay, unless I consult it

904
01:23:06.510 --> 01:23:08.959
sonja baro: because the method was an item.

905
01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:14.690
Anthony Taylor: Well, items, method returns a list of Tuples.

906
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:20.860
Anthony Taylor: See how it's a list, and then it returns a tuple for each key value pair.

907
01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:34.590
Anthony Taylor: So the first one was title, everything everywhere. Second, one was director, and the list of because that's its value. This key has this list as a value. and then and you know, and so on. And so

908
01:23:35.290 --> 01:23:43.479
Anthony Taylor: so, yeah, it's just it will always return the key and the value, no matter what the value is, the value could be another giant dictionary.

909
01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:51.739
Anthony Taylor: But you're only gonna see the key code. And then comma. And then that giant which of course, you could call ars the same way.

910
01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:55.189
Anthony Taylor: So the reason we have the methods

911
01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:57.169
Anthony Taylor: is so we can iterate.

912
01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:04.460
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So now that we can do this, this is basically returning a list, right?

913
01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:08.959
Anthony Taylor: Of all the things one at a time.

914
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:17.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I can le like an iterate value. And where? Where do we iterate? What what thing do we use when we're iterating.

915
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.929
Anthony Taylor: or in 4, or you go.

916
01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:26.559
Anthony Taylor: No, you got it. So here we're gonna say.

917
01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:32.429
Anthony Taylor: I want you to print the keys in film. So 4 key in fill.

918
01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:40.980
Anthony Taylor: okay, print the key. So here's all our keys. Okay. we can also say

919
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.940
Anthony Taylor: for key and film, keys that works too, same way.

920
01:24:45.210 --> 01:24:51.349
Anthony Taylor: And you're like, well, why would that? Why, why did you show us that works the same way? Well. how would I get the value.

921
01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:55.380
Anthony Taylor: I can come down here and say.

922
01:24:55.450 --> 01:25:01.989
Anthony Taylor: for value in dictionary dot values. It's going to return all of those values

923
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:03.910
Anthony Taylor: in

924
01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:07.680
Anthony Taylor: a list. Okay?

925
01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:13.800
Anthony Taylor: So we'll run that, and we'll see the values of those keys. Now, what's important here

926
01:25:14.290 --> 01:25:20.830
Anthony Taylor: is that these are in the same order. So title. title.

927
01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:24.540
Anthony Taylor: distributor, 1, 2, 3, 4,

928
01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:28.820
Anthony Taylor: 1, 2, 3, 4. Okay.

929
01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:31.550
Anthony Taylor: they're in the same order. That's important.

930
01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:36.210
Anthony Taylor: Last, but not least, we can also say. And this is new.

931
01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:41.010
Anthony Taylor: So we saw that film items returns a tuple right?

932
01:25:41.090 --> 01:25:43.689
Anthony Taylor: A 2 value tuple

933
01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:45.969
Anthony Taylor: the key and the value.

934
01:25:46.580 --> 01:25:48.199
Anthony Taylor: So we can say

935
01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:53.200
Anthony Taylor: 4 key comma value because there's 2 items there.

936
01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:57.629
Anthony Taylor: it'll put the first item into key variable and the second item into value.

937
01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:01.589
Anthony Taylor: And then it'll actually print out a whole dictionary.

938
01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:07.280
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so for key value. So key title value every month.

939
01:26:07.710 --> 01:26:10.540
Anthony Taylor: See how that looks cast. There's the list.

940
01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:16.939
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so this is the way we kind of parse and iterate through a dictionary.

941
01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:25.179
Anthony Taylor: I probably I mean, you really do want to understand this items, values and keys and what it returns.

942
01:26:25.450 --> 01:26:33.030
Anthony Taylor: Pretty obvious. He's returned the keys dot values returns the values. And that items returns the key

943
01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:34.379
Anthony Taylor: and the vowel.

944
01:26:35.450 --> 01:26:37.190
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Questions.

945
01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:43.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay, let's go.

946
01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:49.039
Anthony Taylor: So we want you to create a dictionary. How do we create an empty dictionary?

947
01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:51.769
Anthony Taylor: Variable equals? What?

948
01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:56.540
Derek Rikke: Barely wrecked

949
01:26:57.180 --> 01:27:02.120
Anthony Taylor: curly bracken. And then you're going to create a key name.

950
01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:07.560
Anthony Taylor: and then you're gonna give it your name. So key name name is in quotes Colon.

951
01:27:07.630 --> 01:27:11.960
Anthony Taylor: and then a value your name, whatever your name, whatever name you'll use.

952
01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:19.160
Anthony Taylor: Then you're gonna do age. Then you're gonna create a list with your hobbies. and then you're going to live. And these are all within the dictionary.

953
01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:23.650
Anthony Taylor: Then you're going to create a key called, Wake up! And it's going to be a dictionary.

954
01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:30.030
Anthony Taylor: and you're gonna have, like, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. and it's gonna be day and the time you wake up.

955
01:27:31.210 --> 01:27:32.890
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Then.

956
01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:43.220
Anthony Taylor: using the tools we use to read from the dictionary, we want you to print your name and age. Your first hobby in your hobby list, and what time you wake up during the week?

957
01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:46.649
Anthony Taylor: Okay, anytime it doesn't matter which.

958
01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:58.549
Anthony Taylor: Loop through the dictionary, using items. loop through the nested. Wake up dictionary. loop through the nest and wake up dictionary to print out time. So print out the days and the times moving through the wake up.

959
01:27:58.770 --> 01:27:59.810
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

960
01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:01.890
Anthony Taylor: this one's 50.

961
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.290
Anthony Taylor: I wanna make sure I'm telling you right?

962
01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:20.059
Anthony Taylor: You know what I'm gonna give you 15 min. It says 10. But I want you to have 15. Okay. Hi. you guys, ready questions going? One. I do not feel like you guys are struggling with this.

963
01:28:20.450 --> 01:28:26.940
Anthony Taylor: It's it's complex. But I, looking at your faces, I can see there's some pretty intense

964
01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.360
Anthony Taylor: welcome back

965
01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:36.680
Clayton Graves: right right.

966
01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:40.130
Anthony Taylor: I love that Clayton. That makes me feel great.

967
01:28:41.730 --> 01:28:46.840
Mason, Natalie: We did awesome. We were on the last one we thought we were gonna finish.

968
01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:57.019
Anthony Taylor: Oh, my God, that makes me happy! Good, excellent! Then I'll go through it fairly quickly so we can move on to the next dictionary. Stop.

969
01:28:57.230 --> 01:29:09.480
Anthony Taylor: So here's my Zendaya Zendaya. 26. These are me philanthropy, playing with animals fast and social media. Wake up 5, 5, 10 night.

970
01:29:10.170 --> 01:29:12.110
Anthony Taylor: What they're doing on Saturdays.

971
01:29:12.670 --> 01:29:20.680
Anthony Taylor: I'm more like 6, 6, 6, 6 hello! My name, my info name that's important.

972
01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:30.909
Anthony Taylor: and my info age. So one group ran into something, and I want to show you guys what it is. So let me. I ran. That's first sale. Let's run this one. I did not run for sale

973
01:29:31.330 --> 01:29:35.170
Anthony Taylor: so that one's gonna air out. So let's start. Run this cell.

974
01:29:35.230 --> 01:29:40.940
Anthony Taylor: then run this one and everything looks beautiful. Right? So I'm going to isolate this one here

975
01:29:40.990 --> 01:29:42.409
Anthony Taylor: and run it again.

976
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:45.200
Anthony Taylor: So

977
01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:48.440
Anthony Taylor: want to show you what happened

978
01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:57.450
Anthony Taylor: just to remind you. You have seen this before. You are familiar with this. but you may not have remembered

979
01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:03.310
Anthony Taylor: so. Oh, no, it failed. What did that? What? What's wrong with this line?

980
01:30:04.450 --> 01:30:07.760
Anthony Taylor: And look what it did. It says it says,

981
01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:14.000
Anthony Taylor: there's something wrong. There's an F string unmatched bracket. That's interesting.

982
01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:25.440
Anthony Taylor: What do you guys think happened who saw what I did first off. And then why did it happen? Not people that already that did it? Derek done. Rodney.

983
01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:42.780
Vasquez, Gabriel: that you have to? We ran into the same problem as well, but we figured it out. But it was. You can't use the the double quotes if you're gonna have double quotes on the

984
01:30:42.990 --> 01:30:46.240
Vasquez, Gabriel: it on the my info name

985
01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:47.430
Vasquez, Gabriel: bracket

986
01:30:47.610 --> 01:30:49.820
Vasquez, Gabriel: and the Myfoot age bracket.

987
01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:56.970
Anthony Taylor: And it could go the other way, too. You could say, Okay, well, I'm gonna use double quotes here. But I'm gonna use single quotes in here. Perfectly okay.

988
01:30:57.700 --> 01:31:01.459
Anthony Taylor: alright. But we change these back to single quotes.

989
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:04.969
Anthony Taylor: And it worked. Now, remember, we covered that early on.

990
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.809
Anthony Taylor: We were talking about strings if you had like an apostrophe or something. But yeah.

991
01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:22.419
Anthony Taylor: okay, you can't have. You can't like, do one you have to mix and match when you have votes inside of district awesome. So here they grabbed all the items, keys, and values

992
01:31:22.830 --> 01:31:31.879
Anthony Taylor: grab like what days with the keys. So this is interesting, they said. for day in my info wake up!

993
01:31:32.260 --> 01:31:37.810
Anthony Taylor: Which we know is a dictionary. And then they said, give me the keys from that dictionary.

994
01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:43.820
Anthony Taylor: not this dictionary. and you end up with the different dates. Sony.

995
01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:48.189
sonja baro: can you go back over the

996
01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:55.269
sonja baro: the definition of the dictionary up at the top. There was, There's you indented

997
01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:58.999
Anthony Taylor: and like, not necessary. It's just to make it readable.

998
01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:04.520
sonja baro: Oh, okay, cause we did all hours in a full string. A full line.

999
01:32:04.750 --> 01:32:09.649
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, this is just to make the dictionary more readable. In fact, there's actually a

1000
01:32:10.210 --> 01:32:13.370
Anthony Taylor: and a an extension for Vs code.

1001
01:32:13.380 --> 01:32:19.759
Anthony Taylor: that when you have, like a dictionary or Jason object, you could go and highlight it, press it. And it'll do this for you.

1002
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:27.260
sonja baro: Okay, yeah, makes sense. Cause you know, it's like, categorize, it's easier to see what's what. Okay? Thank you.

1003
01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:34.369
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I indentation. And python is vital. But within the data type. It's not within a dictionary, any.

1004
01:32:34.970 --> 01:32:37.110
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And that's it.

1005
01:32:38.150 --> 01:32:39.609
Anthony Taylor: Questions on that one.

1006
01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:46.109
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Good time. We're good. Hmm! We might have to

1007
01:32:46.890 --> 01:32:50.260
Anthony Taylor: do a couple of fun things today. Okay.

1008
01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:58.640
Anthony Taylor: so we now go to work on something else. So here, you see. Oh, now, this is interesting. What is this?

1009
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.810
Anthony Taylor: It is a list. Hello. list.

1010
01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:13.739
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I see this a lot. Actually, I also see a list of Tuples a lot. Okay. So here we have a list

1011
01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:16.520
Anthony Taylor: a list. Everybody see that

1012
01:33:17.290 --> 01:33:20.739
Anthony Taylor: brackets and then inside more brackets.

1013
01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:30.469
Anthony Taylor: So when we have something like this. we have this thing. It's called table data. If we want the Amazon data.

1014
01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:36.569
Anthony Taylor: we could say, Give me by index table data 2. So 0, 1, 2,

1015
01:33:37.190 --> 01:33:38.100
Anthony Taylor: okay.

1016
01:33:38.670 --> 01:33:41.359
Anthony Taylor: And we run that. And we see that right?

1017
01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:51.829
Anthony Taylor: Oh, you know what? I'm gonna clear all these outfits so that you guys don't see it before I run it. Okay? So here we want Amazon's opening price.

1018
01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:55.849
Anthony Taylor: which we can tell from up here is this, 2, 7, 5, 6.

1019
01:33:56.260 --> 01:34:01.999
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to call the one index. So far pretty easy right

1020
01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:11.200
Anthony Taylor: now. Why? So here's an interesting thing, the one index of what did I call the one index of table data

1021
01:34:13.170 --> 01:34:21.980
Anthony Taylor: I did not. So what we've done is with this. we pulled this entire row in.

1022
01:34:22.730 --> 01:34:25.579
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so see, we have the whole thing.

1023
01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:29.389
Anthony Taylor: Now that we have the whole thing, we can use this variable

1024
01:34:29.610 --> 01:34:32.410
Anthony Taylor: and get each individual item out.

1025
01:34:33.210 --> 01:34:36.359
Anthony Taylor: Now, could we do Amazon data to

1026
01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:39.180
Anthony Taylor: bracket one?

1027
01:34:39.510 --> 01:34:42.760
Anthony Taylor: What would that bring? Well, that'll give us the same answer down here

1028
01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:48.369
Anthony Taylor: so we can say, Give me the this list, but give me the

1029
01:34:48.580 --> 01:34:50.429
Anthony Taylor: the one index item.

1030
01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:53.649
Anthony Taylor: We can do that totally.

1031
01:34:54.770 --> 01:34:57.729
Anthony Taylor: But that isn't what they want me to show you there.

1032
01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:05.190
Anthony Taylor: Then let me show you. We captured the row into a column, into a variable. And now we're parsing the individual row.

1033
01:35:06.450 --> 01:35:13.100
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Oh, never mind. And then they wanted me to show you you could do it all at one step. Same thing. Okay.

1034
01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:19.090
Anthony Taylor: if we wanted to iterate through this. So we can do that. We can say 4

1035
01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:30.509
Anthony Taylor: whatever for row in this list, and then output anything we want from these different lists. So let's see how that works for row in that list. It's called table data.

1036
01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:33.250
Anthony Taylor: Give me the row

1037
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:40.069
Anthony Taylor: first item in each row and print it out. So we're going to see Ticker, apple Amazon.

1038
01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:44.310
just like that.

1039
01:35:44.630 --> 01:35:45.840
Anthony Taylor: If I follow.

1040
01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:52.429
Anthony Taylor: We called the list that give us the row. Give us the first item in each row.

1041
01:35:54.110 --> 01:36:00.860
Anthony Taylor: So here we have something a little more interesting. a list of dictionaries.

1042
01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:14.050
Anthony Taylor: That's yeah. Okay. So now we have this list, we can still iterate through it. Yes, Natalie. I need to reverse your names.

1043
01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:17.300
Anthony Taylor: I keep wanting to call you Mason.

1044
01:36:17.630 --> 01:36:25.109
Anthony Taylor: Well, it seems as though, Zoom has a mind of its own with changing my name around and my background.

1045
01:36:25.490 --> 01:36:35.150
Mason, Natalie: So I was wondering about, does it just recognize that Amz? And is Amazon just via

1046
01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:37.569
Mason, Natalie: code. What it already knows.

1047
01:36:37.890 --> 01:36:40.089
Anthony Taylor: No, we we we had to tell it.

1048
01:36:40.110 --> 01:36:41.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay you become.

1049
01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:46.849
Anthony Taylor: We had to tell it which road to grab. We could have filtered it. But you guys haven't learned filtering yet.

1050
01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:54.939
Mason, Natalie: cause what you typed out Amazon data below. But

1051
01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:56.939
Anthony Taylor: remember, I could've called the thought

1052
01:36:58.020 --> 01:36:59.189
Anthony Taylor: it would still work.

1053
01:36:59.370 --> 01:37:06.790
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, we we the We we knew we were gonna call Amazon data row. So we called the variable Amazon.

1054
01:37:07.050 --> 01:37:07.990
Mason, Natalie: Okay.

1055
01:37:08.490 --> 01:37:15.330
Anthony Taylor: yeah, no. You did fine. So so here we're saying from this, and it's like a little table. That's why they keep calling it a table.

1056
01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:19.400
Anthony Taylor: From this table. Give me row 2, which is 0 1 2.

1057
01:37:19.450 --> 01:37:25.420
Mason, Natalie: It doesn't know we could. We could have put one in here.

1058
01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:30.769
Anthony Taylor: and I mean, it would have been Amazon data, but it would have been Apple's actual role.

1059
01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:44.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Which would make Apple really happy, too? Oh, no. Apple. And they would both be okay with that. Okay, so here we have table data. But this time we have a list of dictionary objects.

1060
01:37:45.450 --> 01:37:54.550
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So for here we can come in and say for each item. print the item. Well, what's going to print this whole dictionary?

1061
01:37:55.810 --> 01:37:57.089
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Let's see.

1062
01:37:57.450 --> 01:38:00.690
Anthony Taylor: See Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary. Wait!

1063
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:12.209
Anthony Taylor: I didn't run the dictionary. Hold on! Let me run that again. Those were all lists. Somebody should have called me on that one. So now you can see we have the dictionary with a key, a value, a key, a value, a key of L,

1064
01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:14.470
Anthony Taylor: everybody see that?

1065
01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:16.670
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

1066
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:20.880
Anthony Taylor: So now we're going to go in and say, you know what? I just want the tickers.

1067
01:38:21.730 --> 01:38:30.890
Anthony Taylor: So we're basically going to duplicate what we did here. But with dictionaries. So we're going to say for item and table data that's going to return these things.

1068
01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:33.829
Anthony Taylor: Give me the item.

1069
01:38:35.340 --> 01:38:36.459
Anthony Taylor: one item

1070
01:38:36.740 --> 01:38:39.240
Anthony Taylor: with the key value ticker.

1071
01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:40.539
Anthony Taylor: It's gonna give me that.

1072
01:38:41.570 --> 01:38:44.630
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And then we're gonna print it. And just like that, we got

1073
01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:49.730
Anthony Taylor: pretty awesome. That wasn't hard. Huh?

1074
01:38:51.650 --> 01:38:53.150
Anthony Taylor: Let's

1075
01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:57.770
Anthony Taylor: We're going to do this one as a real everyone do.

1076
01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:01.520
Anthony Taylor: which means everybody's gonna play along

1077
01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:04.390
please.

1078
01:39:05.090 --> 01:39:08.629
Anthony Taylor: so we can share a shade and a little bit of time off.

1079
01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:15.340
Anthony Taylor:  So here

1080
01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:20.350
Anthony Taylor: we have a list inside of this list we have

1081
01:39:21.050 --> 01:39:25.190
Anthony Taylor: third names. And whatever these 2 rows are.

1082
01:39:25.850 --> 01:39:26.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1083
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:31.389
Anthony Taylor: So we ran that we have that captured.

1084
01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:40.880
Anthony Taylor: And then we have a bird's dictionary. So this is a list of lists. This is a list of dictionaries. Oh, look! There's those. There's what those things are.

1085
01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:48.950
Anthony Taylor: size and centimeters, weight and grams and lifespan. It doesn't say how long? Why is it? Days or years?

1086
01:39:50.980 --> 01:39:55.039
Anthony Taylor: I think it's years? Because I know some of these birds live very long time.

1087
01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:59.539
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so that dictionary's pretty long.

1088
01:40:00.180 --> 01:40:03.250
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Now it says, print out the data

1089
01:40:04.210 --> 01:40:10.519
Anthony Taylor:  from about the fourth bird in the bird's list.

1090
01:40:11.190 --> 01:40:13.050
Anthony Taylor: So how would I do it.

1091
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:35.049
sonja baro: Anthony? Just a quick question on that. When it says the fourth bird. it really means the fourth bird. It doesn't mean 4 positions in or for the number 4. Right?

1092
01:40:35.390 --> 01:40:49.029
Anthony Taylor: It means the fourth index. It would bin bald.

1093
01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:55.860
Anthony Taylor: I know, confusing. And you're gonna see that. Just just understand. That's what they.

1094
01:40:55.990 --> 01:41:00.249
Anthony Taylor: So how would we do that. So first, how about this? I'll tell you. We'll iterate

1095
01:41:01.150 --> 01:41:03.830
Anthony Taylor: through that list.

1096
01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:06.460
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

1097
01:41:06.790 --> 01:41:10.009
Anthony Taylor: And what do we want to return? What do we want to print out.

1098
01:41:12.850 --> 01:41:17.339
Anthony Taylor: We want all of the information about the fourth birth.

1099
01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:21.350
Anthony Taylor: So the first iteration is going to go in here.

1100
01:41:21.490 --> 01:41:23.930
Anthony Taylor: We want to get this, Burt.

1101
01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:27.550
Anthony Taylor: How am I going to get it?

1102
01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:37.030
sonja baro: Don't you have to tell it to go to the third index? So we're gonna print

1103
01:41:37.550 --> 01:41:39.840
Anthony Taylor: row, right?

1104
01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:46.870
Anthony Taylor: Cause we're going through each we called it fair grow. Remember, that could be, Bob. You could. We could. In fact, I'm gonna make it, Bob, for you guys this time.

1105
01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:58.969
Anthony Taylor: Okay, just so, you understand, it's a variable. It could be anything that makes sense. Bob doesn't make sense, which is why I do that. But we want the third index.

1106
01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:07.180
Anthony Taylor: and we're going to get it from every one of these lists. So we're gonna have all the information about the Oscar.

1107
01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:13.780
Anthony Taylor: Good job. Wait. Why do you say? No, you don't want to tell me the answer.

1108
01:42:17.190 --> 01:42:23.420
sonja baro: I'm going okay. So this one

1109
01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:24.820
Anthony Taylor: little harder.

1110
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:31.610
Anthony Taylor: They want us to calculate the total weight in kilograms of all the birds in the bird's list.

1111
01:42:32.890 --> 01:42:34.589
Anthony Taylor: So this is just a print.

1112
01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:39.529
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're gonna say, total.

1113
01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:42.959
Anthony Taylor: Third weights. Now.

1114
01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:46.449
Anthony Taylor: we know bird weights is the third row.

1115
01:42:46.490 --> 01:42:53.409
Anthony Taylor: How do I know? Because in the dictionary weights is the third row. Okay, so how do I get the total of all those person.

1116
01:42:53.780 --> 01:42:55.099
Anthony Taylor: What's the easy way?

1117
01:43:00.610 --> 01:43:02.560
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Here's a cue function.

1118
01:43:03.770 --> 01:43:05.300
Anthony Taylor: What? What did I hear, Meredith?

1119
01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:19.820
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Cindy said the same thing. So we need to get to that row

1120
01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:29.489
Anthony Taylor: and then do it. So so first we gotta put the name of the list. We gotta put it in curly brackets. We gotta do the name of the list

1121
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:38.829
Anthony Taylor: birds underscore list. and then we need to know which row to go to. So here's the list

1122
01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:42.440
Anthony Taylor: which row which index has

1123
01:43:42.690 --> 01:43:44.250
Anthony Taylor: the all of the weights in.

1124
01:43:47.180 --> 01:43:49.850
Anthony Taylor:  is that right? You're right.

1125
01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.360
Anthony Taylor: 2, 0

1126
01:43:52.450 --> 01:43:54.490
Anthony Taylor: 1, 2.

1127
01:43:55.860 --> 01:43:56.850
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1128
01:43:57.270 --> 01:44:00.519
Anthony Taylor: so we're going to do bracket 2,

1129
01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:01.860
Anthony Taylor: okay.

1130
01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:10.330
Anthony Taylor:  and that gives us the row. So if I just ran this, I'm gonna get that. That's not what we want. So we need to sum

1131
01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:15.879
Anthony Taylor: the whole list. So I'm gonna wrap this in a function.

1132
01:44:16.150 --> 01:44:22.190
Anthony Taylor: And I'm going to summit. And there it is. Now, I could add some more cool stuff to this right? I could say

1133
01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:23.940
Anthony Taylor: in kilograms.

1134
01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:33.889
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I could even like. but decimals, I can do all kinds of fun stuff with this. Actually wait, hold on time out!

1135
01:44:34.350 --> 01:44:36.159
Anthony Taylor: It says in kilograms.

1136
01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:44.260
Anthony Taylor: What? Wait? Where do you think? Yeah, the total bird weights 31, 315,000 kilos?

1137
01:44:46.030 --> 01:44:49.050
Anthony Taylor: No. it's in grams.

1138
01:44:50.070 --> 01:44:52.050
Anthony Taylor: So what do we need to do to get that right.

1139
01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:54.170
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Divide by a thousand.

1140
01:44:54.510 --> 01:44:56.179
Anthony Taylor: divide by a thousand.

1141
01:44:57.620 --> 01:44:59.559
Anthony Taylor: Now it makes more sense.

1142
01:45:01.190 --> 01:45:15.149
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But it was just a difference between like a an African swallow and a European swallow knows the difference. We're not doing that.

1143
01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:17.699
sonja baro: And his favorite Tala.

1144
01:45:18.370 --> 01:45:27.679
Anthony Taylor: That was good, Rodney. That was, that was quick. That was that was good. That was like that was great a right.

1145
01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:29.390
Anthony Taylor: It was like a

1146
01:45:29.570 --> 01:45:32.699
Anthony Taylor: and that just made me happy. It made me happy. I'm happy.

1147
01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:37.329
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Anthony. I have a question about the sort of syntax of how you did it.

1148
01:45:37.650 --> 01:45:41.040
Meredith McCanse (she/her):  the thumb.

1149
01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:44.869
Meredith McCanse (she/her): because originally we had birds list in curly brackets.

1150
01:45:44.990 --> 01:45:47.950
Meredith McCanse (she/her): But then you move the curly back in cloud.

1151
01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:51.650
Meredith McCanse (she/her): because remember the curly brackets tell the print

1152
01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:55.890
Anthony Taylor: with the F that this is just like python code we're adding.

1153
01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:02.760
Anthony Taylor: So we could have done this in a variable. We could have, you know, created a bob variable and and just did

1154
01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:04.610
Anthony Taylor: all of this logic.

1155
01:46:06.350 --> 01:46:18.049
Anthony Taylor: Oops. I don't know what I just did. There we go. Oh, you copied in the zoom link that you sent me. I think I did. Yeah, so we could do that like this. And then inside of here, just put Bob.

1156
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:22.730
Anthony Taylor: okay, and this will. This will work just fine, too.

1157
01:46:23.190 --> 01:46:27.719
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So the curly bracket doesn't have anything to do with the fact that it was the list.

1158
01:46:27.910 --> 01:46:32.990
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay.

1159
01:46:33.980 --> 01:46:35.770
Anthony Taylor: curly brackets is code.

1160
01:46:36.570 --> 01:46:40.700
Anthony Taylor: Okay, is just we're running python code in the middle of the print state.

1161
01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:45.010
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Got it. That's why I was confused. Thank you.

1162
01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:50.660
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So now it says, let's loop through the Burb's dictionary list. Okay.

1163
01:46:50.690 --> 01:46:54.569
Anthony Taylor: this was the student exercise. You guys would have hated me for this.

1164
01:46:54.680 --> 01:47:01.059
Anthony Taylor: So what? But I do? Alright. So there's the dictionary. We're gonna loop through that. And

1165
01:47:01.490 --> 01:47:05.430
Anthony Taylor: that's all it says, just, oh, it wants us to do all this stuff down here. Okay.

1166
01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:12.340
Anthony Taylor: so we're gonna start with the loop. So we'll say, 4 bird and birds dictionaries.

1167
01:47:12.810 --> 01:47:25.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, normally, if I was coding this right right now, I'd print out Bird. Make sure I got what I want. Alright. Okay, yep, I got some. So now it says, print the names of birds and their lifespans from

1168
01:47:25.540 --> 01:47:33.379
Anthony Taylor: the dictionary. So that's this. And this. So this isn't that hard. We already got print. Let's just keep going print name

1169
01:47:33.510 --> 01:47:35.910
Anthony Taylor: and quotes

1170
01:47:36.380 --> 01:47:41.239
Anthony Taylor: and then, since they put in one line so we'll do print

1171
01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:42.610
Anthony Taylor: bird

1172
01:47:43.260 --> 01:47:45.750
Anthony Taylor: bracket clothes lifespan.

1173
01:47:46.110 --> 01:47:47.709
Anthony Taylor: Run that. And there you go.

1174
01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:53.019
Anthony Taylor: Follow it's just a dictionary.

1175
01:47:54.150 --> 01:48:01.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay. calculate and print out the size to hate race you. Okay. whatever.

1176
01:48:01.670 --> 01:48:10.459
Anthony Taylor: So I'm going to just comment those out, because that's going to take up a lot of make a mess. So let's do the size to weight ratio. So we'll create a variable for that one.

1177
01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:12.659
Anthony Taylor: so we could do it in

1178
01:48:12.870 --> 01:48:18.799
Anthony Taylor: the line in line as we like color. But we won't. We'll do it here. So we're gonna say.

1179
01:48:19.390 --> 01:48:22.439
Anthony Taylor: Bird Square bracket.

1180
01:48:22.690 --> 01:48:31.419
Anthony Taylor: And we need the size. Now notice that key. It's actually showing up on my screen. It's size with the Cm in there.

1181
01:48:31.870 --> 01:48:32.950
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1182
01:48:33.100 --> 01:48:37.810
Anthony Taylor:  and we're gonna divide that.

1183
01:48:38.270 --> 01:48:39.570
Anthony Taylor: Push the normal button.

1184
01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:43.639
Anthony Taylor: There we go. Divide that by bird

1185
01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:54.230
Anthony Taylor: bracket. And this one is weight. That's interesting. It didn't come up. Won't I type something wrong here?

1186
01:48:55.330 --> 01:48:57.530
Anthony Taylor: Per, no, that's weird.

1187
01:48:58.450 --> 01:49:02.440
Anthony Taylor: Sometimes that auto fill thing doesn't go where you want it to.

1188
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:06.090
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And then we'll just print it out. We'll keep this simple.

1189
01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:11.449
sonja baro: does it matter? Yeah, like, I must have a, but

1190
01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:18.179
sonja baro: the spaces, okay, between weight and the G,

1191
01:49:19.750 --> 01:49:25.969
Anthony Taylor: yeah, I think so. It depends on. If that's the well here we can see, because down here it has. It's right.

1192
01:49:27.310 --> 01:49:30.529
Anthony Taylor: Okay, well, let's run it and see. Oh, yeah, it worked.

1193
01:49:31.650 --> 01:49:33.829
Anthony Taylor: It worked. I'm very excited.

1194
01:49:35.140 --> 01:49:36.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

1195
01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:46.380
Anthony Taylor:  oh, and then it just wants you to figure out who has the highest hits lowest by so clearly. The third index has the highest

1196
01:49:47.860 --> 01:49:49.320
Anthony Taylor: and the lowest

1197
01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:52.290
Anthony Taylor: is that guy

1198
01:49:53.850 --> 01:49:58.430
Anthony Taylor: 0 1, 2, 3, 4, I 6.

1199
01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:00.330
sonja baro: Hummingbird.

1200
01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:06.690
sonja baro: II would think so. Yeah, so that so yeah, we did all those. We just did them all in one step.

1201
01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:10.170
Anthony Taylor: Excellent questions about nested

1202
01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:14.110
Anthony Taylor: again. These are things I want you to know how to do it. I want you to see it.

1203
01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:18.130
Anthony Taylor: If it's not like locked in your brain, don't freak out. You're fine.

1204
01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:21.480
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you're gonna run into this so many times.

1205
01:50:21.860 --> 01:50:24.580
Anthony Taylor: Let me look at this, do we?

1206
01:50:25.250 --> 01:50:29.049
Anthony Taylor: So this is the same thing as the last one. Except for a dictionary.

1207
01:50:29.150 --> 01:50:32.910
Anthony Taylor: We'll go through it because it looks really big and crazy. Okay.

1208
01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:36.589
Anthony Taylor: but it's not. It's just think of it, just like the list one

1209
01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:40.209
Anthony Taylor: except for this time. The outer

1210
01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:43.830
Anthony Taylor: is, I'm getting rid of all that stuff I just had up. The screen

1211
01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:52.609
Anthony Taylor: is a dictionary. So here's your dictionary. Here's your first key. And in there is yet another dictionary.

1212
01:50:52.670 --> 01:50:58.270
Anthony Taylor: Now, if you're not seeing these colored brackets, tell you right now, you want to see those colored brackets.

1213
01:50:59.690 --> 01:51:03.780
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you see how they're cut like the yellow here. pink here.

1214
01:51:03.980 --> 01:51:08.550
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if I go look for the other end of this bracket.

1215
01:51:09.390 --> 01:51:14.670
Anthony Taylor: all I gotta do is go to the first yellow right there. Peak

1216
01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:21.469
Anthony Taylor: is right there. This blue goes with this blue, this blue

1217
01:51:25.670 --> 01:51:27.050
goes with this split.

1218
01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:28.190
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

1219
01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:32.289
Anthony Taylor: So it's very helpful, because you will get lost sometimes

1220
01:51:32.490 --> 01:51:35.010
Anthony Taylor: on brackets.

1221
01:51:35.260 --> 01:51:43.930
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. So we're gonna load this dictionary. It's got this. This first key has this huge dictionary

1222
01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:49.620
Anthony Taylor: alright within it has more keys with lists. keys with lists.

1223
01:51:49.980 --> 01:51:56.039
Anthony Taylor: Here's just a single item. Here's a key with a dictionary, a key with a dictionary.

1224
01:51:56.630 --> 01:52:06.030
Anthony Taylor: And then, oh, here's a new movie. Same items. Okay, does it have to have the same items? Nope. it does not.

1225
01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:08.679
Anthony Taylor: But it's convenient when it does.

1226
01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:15.820
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So it says, Welcome to the film Repository. Why not? So it says, while true.

1227
01:52:18.100 --> 01:52:22.420
Anthony Taylor: we're going to print. Which film would you like to view information about?

1228
01:52:22.540 --> 01:52:23.440
Anthony Taylor: So

1229
01:52:23.620 --> 01:52:28.270
Anthony Taylor: we're going to keep track of the variable. I we'll find out why.

1230
01:52:28.730 --> 01:52:30.600
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to print out

1231
01:52:30.660 --> 01:52:33.979
Anthony Taylor: menu items. This is an empty dictionary.

1232
01:52:34.040 --> 01:52:45.659
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna say, for key in film's key friends. Hi. okay, that sounds horrible, doesn't. What, Anthony, are you nuts?

1233
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:48.850
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So here's how we're gonna do this.

1234
01:52:49.190 --> 01:52:52.630
Anthony Taylor:  this.

1235
01:52:53.790 --> 01:53:00.040
Anthony Taylor: So it's saying, 4 key in film, dot. T, okay, so remember what film that keys does.

1236
01:53:00.120 --> 01:53:04.050
Anthony Taylor: Let's just write that the film dot piece

1237
01:53:07.620 --> 01:53:10.970
Anthony Taylor: do I miss something named film not defined, did I?

1238
01:53:12.570 --> 01:53:14.460
Anthony Taylor: Is it called films, of course.

1239
01:53:15.550 --> 01:53:20.280
Anthony Taylor: films. So films that keys gonna give us all of those keys.

1240
01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:26.769
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so it's like, so basically. remember, this is the base root key.

1241
01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:32.330
Anthony Taylor: the way this dictionary is created. The base root key is this one.

1242
01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:34.910
Anthony Taylor: this one

1243
01:53:36.210 --> 01:53:40.230
Anthony Taylor: and this one. Does everybody understand that? Never understand why? That

1244
01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:46.489
Anthony Taylor: because each one of those has there are a key, and the value is, get another dictionary.

1245
01:53:47.180 --> 01:53:49.369
Anthony Taylor: That's it. And it's just that's all that's there.

1246
01:53:49.660 --> 01:53:51.510
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so

1247
01:53:52.190 --> 01:54:07.510
Anthony Taylor: this is going to go key films, dot key print one key. Then it's going to go to the menu I are. It's going to add to

1248
01:54:07.780 --> 01:54:10.610
Anthony Taylor: the menu items dictionary where to go

1249
01:54:11.820 --> 01:54:13.260
Anthony Taylor: right here.

1250
01:54:13.890 --> 01:54:16.469
Anthony Taylor: It's going to add one.

1251
01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:22.800
Anthony Taylor: And the key values of the name of the movie. then it's going to increase I

1252
01:54:22.810 --> 01:54:24.850
Anthony Taylor: by one. So now

1253
01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:27.040
Anthony Taylor: I is 2

1254
01:54:28.010 --> 01:54:29.600
Anthony Taylor: print 2

1255
01:54:31.070 --> 01:54:40.150
Anthony Taylor: key value, which is the second movie cause. We're looping. And we're going to add it to that menu items. Dictionary menu. Item number 2

1256
01:54:40.450 --> 01:54:42.540
Anthony Taylor: is going to be the second movie.

1257
01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:48.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Then it's going to say which one you want

1258
01:54:48.980 --> 01:55:02.750
Anthony Taylor: and and show you. So it's gonna print these all out. And it's gonna ask you, which movie do you wanna see. you say, if you put in a queue, it's just going to stop. If you do not, it's going to make sure it's a number which is good.

1259
01:55:03.050 --> 01:55:04.790
Anthony Taylor: Then it's going to say

1260
01:55:04.990 --> 01:55:12.489
Anthony Taylor:  If this item is in the menu item, please those 3 items.

1261
01:55:13.420 --> 01:55:17.449
Anthony Taylor: then so it's selected and grab that

1262
01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:24.310
Anthony Taylor: dictionary. And it's gonna tell you what you just did. And then it's gonna give you the film selection name.

1263
01:55:24.730 --> 01:55:27.139
Anthony Taylor: It's going to print some menu dashes

1264
01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:32.160
Anthony Taylor: and then it's gonna print every key and value for that meeting.

1265
01:55:32.730 --> 01:55:33.990
Anthony Taylor: So key value.

1266
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:45.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's gonna say, if the type value is a dictionary, so do we have, that is that happening up here? What's the value of this? The string, a list, or a dictionary?

1267
01:55:46.690 --> 01:55:50.140
Anthony Taylor: This is the key. What's the value string a list for addiction

1268
01:55:51.630 --> 01:55:54.229
Meredith McCanse (she/her): dictionary, because it's curly brackets.

1269
01:55:54.560 --> 01:56:00.000
Anthony Taylor: Great. Huh! There's the value. right? So here's the key.

1270
01:56:00.170 --> 01:56:04.260
Anthony Taylor: Here's the value. So it's a string. What's this one? Here's the key

1271
01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:08.939
Anthony Taylor: string list or value or do, it's time

1272
01:56:09.220 --> 01:56:10.090
Masarirambi, Rodney: West.

1273
01:56:17.450 --> 01:56:18.510
Anthony Taylor: which one is.

1274
01:56:18.850 --> 01:56:20.050
Meredith McCanse (she/her): she's right.

1275
01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:25.499
Sihong Zhou: this one destination

1276
01:56:25.700 --> 01:56:31.779
Anthony Taylor: and this one. Okay? So in our logic, we're saying.

1277
01:56:32.140 --> 01:56:37.250
Anthony Taylor:  if it's a digit. Good. Okay. Grab the keys.

1278
01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:43.629
Anthony Taylor: And then this loop right here is saying, Okay, grab the key and value.

1279
01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:50.819
Anthony Taylor: If the value is the dictionary so like we just did in our head just now. We just did this physically.

1280
01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:55.859
Anthony Taylor: and we said, Is it a dictionary? No, it's a string. Is that a dictionary? No, it's a list.

1281
01:56:56.230 --> 01:57:08.360
Anthony Taylor: So this is only going to respond. If it comes to a value that is a dictionary. and then it's gonna do a new key in value for the new dictionary that it just picked up.

1282
01:57:09.180 --> 01:57:12.029
Anthony Taylor: It's gonna create a bunch of spaces

1283
01:57:12.220 --> 01:57:16.870
Anthony Taylor: and then it's going to print out key.

1284
01:57:17.250 --> 01:57:19.780
Anthony Taylor: then the the second key

1285
01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:23.720
Anthony Taylor: and spaces and the value.

1286
01:57:25.790 --> 01:57:32.110
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so this is gonna go first, dictionary. second dictionary. that

1287
01:57:33.750 --> 01:57:35.360
Anthony Taylor: alright, what does that mean?

1288
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:40.220
Anthony Taylor: It gets to here. Let's get to a dictionary. It gets to here.

1289
01:57:41.230 --> 01:57:45.070
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And it says, this is my key.

1290
01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:51.060
Anthony Taylor: and then it goes. Give me the keys and values inside this dictionary, and these become key, too.

1291
01:57:51.420 --> 01:57:53.109
Anthony Taylor: So here's key one

1292
01:57:54.390 --> 01:57:55.710
Anthony Taylor: key, 2.

1293
01:57:57.160 --> 01:57:59.670
Anthony Taylor: Valley 2.

1294
01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:03.370
Anthony Taylor: Why is this value? 2. What's value one in this case

1295
01:58:06.220 --> 01:58:06.910
incorrect

1296
01:58:07.650 --> 01:58:12.709
Vasquez, Gabriel: first thing in addition.

1297
01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:17.250
Anthony Taylor: So, key is this value is this

1298
01:58:17.260 --> 01:58:20.239
Raugewitz, Tania: key too? If these guys

1299
01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:22.479
Anthony Taylor: value 2, are these guys.

1300
01:58:23.950 --> 01:58:25.060
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1301
01:58:25.470 --> 01:58:30.830
Anthony Taylor: where is that? So here we are. See? So here's key 2 value 2.

1302
01:58:31.130 --> 01:58:33.560
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to print out the key.

1303
01:58:33.730 --> 01:58:35.530
Anthony Taylor: Then he, too

1304
01:58:35.660 --> 01:58:43.289
Anthony Taylor: value to. If the type value is a list. we're just going to loop through that list

1305
01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:47.530
Anthony Taylor: and output the key index for each item. That's it.

1306
01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.889
Anthony Taylor: Okay, else we're just going to print out a string.

1307
01:58:51.420 --> 01:58:53.309
Anthony Taylor: This extra stuff in here

1308
01:58:55.660 --> 01:58:59.610
Anthony Taylor: is is not 100% necessary. It's just nothing.

1309
01:58:59.940 --> 01:59:08.199
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So we're gonna print some dashes. We're gonna enter to return back to the selection option. and that's the end of it. So let's run this

1310
01:59:08.570 --> 01:59:17.290
Anthony Taylor:  I'm gonna put elementals because I don't remember all the move. Oh, wait! It gave him to me. Oh, no, I don't wanna put enough. I wanna put a no problem.

1311
01:59:17.340 --> 01:59:20.049
Anthony Taylor: So let's look at hidden figures. Love that.

1312
01:59:21.640 --> 01:59:28.390
Anthony Taylor: and notice what it did. It failed. That's good menu dashes. Where was menu? Dashes.

1313
01:59:28.940 --> 01:59:31.670
Anthony Taylor: print menudashes. Did I just not run it.

1314
01:59:32.350 --> 01:59:33.569
Anthony Taylor: I did not run it.

1315
01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:36.519
Anthony Taylor: Okay, let's do that again.

1316
01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:42.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so I want to print the number. I want to print 2, and let's see what we got.

1317
01:59:43.570 --> 01:59:47.390
Anthony Taylor: So we picked hidden figures. Oh, wow! We'll leave it right

1318
01:59:47.590 --> 01:59:59.240
Anthony Taylor: and then here's the dictionary reference, all the information writer, 0 writer one. So it had 2 writers. our awesome cast. the distributor

1319
01:59:59.510 --> 02:00:05.649
Anthony Taylor: Fox office in the Us. And Japan, and more release dates all of that

1320
02:00:05.970 --> 02:00:11.020
Anthony Taylor: so real quick a cool thing about. Well, let me kill this. Escape.

1321
02:00:12.150 --> 02:00:12.880
Anthony Taylor: Q.

1322
02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:28.379
Anthony Taylor:  If you want to see all the time in in in notebooks, you'll get this if it's like a log return. You'll get this dot dot dot. You want to see it. Just click text editor, and then it'll open a new tab and show you the whole.

1323
02:00:30.430 --> 02:00:36.510
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so was that pretty cool. I know it's kind of complicated. But

1324
02:00:36.710 --> 02:00:41.580
Anthony Taylor:  it's a lot of fun. It's a lot of fun. I don't see it

1325
02:00:41.670 --> 02:00:42.970
Anthony Taylor: that's working now

1326
02:00:44.990 --> 02:00:46.040
Anthony Taylor: to

1327
02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:56.360
Anthony Taylor: did, huh? Okay? So maybe next class, I'm gonna walk. You guys how to use the Tpa

1328
02:00:57.290 --> 02:00:58.970
Anthony Taylor: pretty handy.

1329
02:00:59.930 --> 02:01:02.890
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we can.

1330
02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:08.630
Anthony Taylor: you guys see what's happening.

1331
02:01:09.540 --> 02:01:20.400
Anthony Taylor: So what's happening is is over here. It's showing you like all of the variables that are active right now. And as I step through the code. it's filling them in. So there's item spaces.

1332
02:01:20.510 --> 02:01:23.349
Anthony Taylor: And then next, well, it's gonna print. But

1333
02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:31.079
Anthony Taylor: so there's so 4 key value. We can see there's the key is now writer.

1334
02:01:31.620 --> 02:01:38.930
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And the value is this list. So if the if the value in the list is this going to be true or false.

1335
02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:41.350
Anthony Taylor: the slide

1336
02:01:45.050 --> 02:01:46.090
Meredith McCanse (she/her): pass

1337
02:01:46.170 --> 02:01:52.049
Anthony Taylor: false. So when we when we step, it's not gonna go in year, it's gonna move on

1338
02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:55.850
Anthony Taylor: to here. So now let's do it. Elstiff.

1339
02:01:55.970 --> 02:02:02.469
Anthony Taylor: is this value a list? Well, we can see this value. It is, in fact, a list. So now it's going to go inside.

1340
02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:05.280
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1341
02:02:05.550 --> 02:02:14.770
Anthony Taylor: So now we can, actually, we can watch this, I variable. It's going to change in a sec. Oh, well, maybe not for I and range link. Yeah, it changed to a 0.

1342
02:02:15.500 --> 02:02:19.499
Anthony Taylor: So we can also see this number of items.

1343
02:02:20.970 --> 02:02:27.819
Anthony Taylor: It's the spaces equals 38 blah blah blah. Oh, that's from last time. So it'll go up yeah, or down

1344
02:02:28.100 --> 02:02:34.279
Anthony Taylor: and then that that's fine. So like I said, that's jump. So here we have team writer.

1345
02:02:34.420 --> 02:02:36.629
Anthony Taylor: I is

1346
02:02:37.470 --> 02:02:41.620
Anthony Taylor: 0. So we're going to get the first item from

1347
02:02:43.190 --> 02:02:47.110
Anthony Taylor: the value. Which is this list 0

1348
02:02:48.210 --> 02:02:49.100
Anthony Taylor: got it?

1349
02:02:49.350 --> 02:02:54.330
Anthony Taylor: Is this debug thing help you or hurt you tell me what you guys think it's first time I've ever showed it to anybody

1350
02:02:55.440 --> 02:03:06.249
Anthony Taylor: I know. Gabe loves it. But Gabe seems before. Okay, alright sorry. Okay. So anyway, that's how it works when you're done with this. By the way, and you can just run that

1351
02:03:06.330 --> 02:03:12.699
Anthony Taylor:  probably can stop it. Yeah. Or you can just disconnect it and then finish it.

1352
02:03:13.150 --> 02:03:14.529
Finish it off normal.

1353
02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:16.440
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1354
02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:20.709
Meredith McCanse (she/her): After that, you can just click the sorry

1355
02:03:21.090 --> 02:03:28.810
Meredith McCanse (she/her): to access that, did you? Just did you just in the debug menu? Did you just click the blue button at the top? That said, run and debug?

1356
02:03:29.330 --> 02:03:37.820
Anthony Taylor: Well, what I actually did is right here. See this debun, or you can hit, control, shift, altar, enter or command shift, alt. Enter, probably.

1357
02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:41.389
Anthony Taylor: But the key is is you need to put

1358
02:03:41.460 --> 02:03:46.080
Anthony Taylor: the break point. So you see this little red dot that's showing up right there.

1359
02:03:46.270 --> 02:03:47.280
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yeah.

1360
02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:51.550
Anthony Taylor: okay, you put that break point in and it'll stop

1361
02:03:51.670 --> 02:03:52.620
Anthony Taylor: right there.

1362
02:03:53.640 --> 02:04:00.620
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And it doesn't. If you just run debug least earlier, it didn't like that.

1363
02:04:01.270 --> 02:04:02.720
Let's see how about now?

1364
02:04:02.970 --> 02:04:10.049
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, see, it's not doing. And it doesn't even know what you want. Doesn't have any variables, doesn't anything. So you would just do disconnect.

1365
02:04:11.830 --> 02:04:13.349
Anthony Taylor: and then you would finish it.

1366
02:04:14.900 --> 02:04:17.430
Anthony Taylor: Dang it. Stop touching my eye.

1367
02:04:17.980 --> 02:04:20.810
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but if I put in like

1368
02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:23.730
Anthony Taylor: a red dot, actually, I'm putting it like we have here.

1369
02:04:25.610 --> 02:04:38.059
Anthony Taylor: turn that one off. run and debug. No, don't do it from there, because it's confusing. Do it from here. Okay. Now it stops at that red spot and lets you do the stepping that I was just

1370
02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:40.610
Anthony Taylor: okay.

1371
02:04:40.790 --> 02:04:46.449
Anthony Taylor: I'm happy to work with you guys on this like outside, like, later, if you guys really really wanna

1372
02:04:46.830 --> 02:04:51.300
Anthony Taylor: it is a very strong tool, and I've never shown it to a class before.

1373
02:04:52.690 --> 02:05:03.070
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we have 8 min. So here's what I'm going to do. I really want to show you guys wait. Let's say, day 2 or 3. They stay 3. So I want to show you this comprehension.

1374
02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:13.450
Anthony Taylor: If we have time we'll do the list. Apprehension isn't that bad? And if we have time we'll go back and do the student stuff. Otherwise you guys can do it and come to office hours if you want.

1375
02:05:13.670 --> 02:05:16.230
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. So

1376
02:05:16.690 --> 02:05:19.040
Anthony Taylor: we have a variable halibut.

1377
02:05:20.630 --> 02:05:26.199
Anthony Taylor: I've got a bunch of hot. But in the freezer I need to cook. I just remember that. Okay, so here we have this list.

1378
02:05:26.810 --> 02:05:29.299
Anthony Taylor: And I'm going to use a for loop.

1379
02:05:29.530 --> 02:05:34.869
Anthony Taylor: And I'm going to put every letter into this list. We all know this code. We've seen it before. Right?

1380
02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:38.369
Anthony Taylor: 4 letter in fish. So 4. Letter in howl

1381
02:05:38.770 --> 02:05:40.660
Anthony Taylor: letters, this list

1382
02:05:40.700 --> 02:05:44.319
Anthony Taylor: got. Append not a letter, and we will get

1383
02:05:44.540 --> 02:05:46.740
Anthony Taylor: a nifty cool list with each letter.

1384
02:05:47.470 --> 02:05:49.940
Anthony Taylor: Now to be pythonic.

1385
02:05:50.050 --> 02:05:52.370
Anthony Taylor: There's that word again twice in one day.

1386
02:05:53.400 --> 02:05:57.790
Anthony Taylor: Okay. we're going to do this in one line of code.

1387
02:05:58.190 --> 02:06:03.080
Anthony Taylor: Do not let this intimidate you one. You don't have to do this.

1388
02:06:03.410 --> 02:06:08.569
Anthony Taylor: 2. Okay. most of the time. I don't do this

1389
02:06:09.090 --> 02:06:12.460
Anthony Taylor: when I do. I always feel really cool.

1390
02:06:13.690 --> 02:06:25.410
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's if I even think about it. Normally, I don't even think about. Now. Kevin loves this comprehension. Does it? Every chance he can, because Kevin is actually cool.

1391
02:06:26.620 --> 02:06:27.400
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1392
02:06:27.860 --> 02:06:29.870
Anthony Taylor: alright. Here we go. So

1393
02:06:30.230 --> 02:06:31.790
Anthony Taylor: the syntax.

1394
02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:36.610
Anthony Taylor: It's a for loop just like this. You see it.

1395
02:06:36.880 --> 02:06:39.969
Anthony Taylor: 4 letter in fish, 4. Letter in fish.

1396
02:06:40.710 --> 02:06:46.720
Anthony Taylor: But before the for loop we can do something with this variable.

1397
02:06:47.690 --> 02:06:53.769
Anthony Taylor: So for right now, I just want it to create a list. That's what this is gonna do.

1398
02:06:54.270 --> 02:07:02.539
Anthony Taylor: And it's gonna for each letter. It's just gonna put it in the list because we're not doing anything with. So basically, we got the same thing as up here.

1399
02:07:03.450 --> 02:07:10.209
Anthony Taylor: Okay. but let's make them all capital letters. So first, we'll do it with our the way we learned with the for loop.

1400
02:07:10.540 --> 02:07:17.289
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so 4 letter and fish. And then we're going to append to the capital letters, list, letter, dot puppet.

1401
02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:22.910
Anthony Taylor: We all know how to do that right. We're comfortable with that list. Comprehension.

1402
02:07:24.130 --> 02:07:35.170
Anthony Taylor: 4. Letter in fish. same thing. that variable. We can now do whatever we need to do to it right here. letter dot upper

1403
02:07:35.470 --> 02:07:40.350
Anthony Taylor: and and it'll automatically create the same list. You see here, right here.

1404
02:07:41.980 --> 02:07:43.300
Anthony Taylor: Okay, same thing.

1405
02:07:44.970 --> 02:07:45.850
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1406
02:07:46.140 --> 02:07:54.200
Anthony Taylor: So here's where you're gonna see this get a little crazy. Now. Alright. So here we have a for loop. We have temperatures, and we have hot days.

1407
02:07:54.220 --> 02:07:57.460
Anthony Taylor: What we want to do is every

1408
02:07:57.480 --> 02:08:07.549
Anthony Taylor: temperature that is greater than 90. We want to add it to the hot days list. Now, I want you guys to follow this logic. This is where we're gonna start thinking like a developer.

1409
02:08:08.870 --> 02:08:13.929
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this moment. I know you guys been writing code for like 3 days.

1410
02:08:13.970 --> 02:08:17.089
Anthony Taylor: But right now, we're gonna think like a developer.

1411
02:08:17.490 --> 02:08:23.619
Anthony Taylor: What do I need to do? Well, I need to loop through this list. And for each item I need to check if it's greater than 90,

1412
02:08:23.740 --> 02:08:24.550
Anthony Taylor: that's it.

1413
02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:31.429
Anthony Taylor: if it's greater than 90, I'm going to add it to this list. So loop through the list for temperature in July temperatures.

1414
02:08:32.090 --> 02:08:36.409
Anthony Taylor: If that temperature is greater than 90.

1415
02:08:36.760 --> 02:08:40.090
Anthony Taylor: I want to put it into this list.

1416
02:08:40.340 --> 02:08:42.590
Anthony Taylor: and then I'm going to print that list.

1417
02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:49.829
Anthony Taylor: and we are done. Now let's look at this and list comprehension.

1418
02:08:51.300 --> 02:08:58.410
Anthony Taylor: One line of code that's cool. Right? So hot days equals, we're going to create the list called hot days.

1419
02:08:58.910 --> 02:08:59.770
Anthony Taylor: So

1420
02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:03.689
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna have this. This is the same for loop.

1421
02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:10.849
Anthony Taylor: And here's the variable. But note. there is a filter at the end.

1422
02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:19.750
Anthony Taylor: So what this really reads is for temperature in July, temperatures that are greater than 90

1423
02:09:21.210 --> 02:09:26.699
Anthony Taylor: return this value? Technically, this value to a list.

1424
02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:35.590
Anthony Taylor: So this is exactly the same. It's that Zack.

1425
02:09:36.700 --> 02:09:39.619
Anthony Taylor: And we get the exact same values.

1426
02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:41.920
Anthony Taylor: Aye.

1427
02:09:42.090 --> 02:09:45.760
Meredith McCanse (she/her): is this an example where the word temperature could also be, Bob.

1428
02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:49.799
Anthony Taylor: absolutely. We. In fact, I wanna do it right now, Bob.

1429
02:09:50.230 --> 02:09:58.999
Anthony Taylor: I love that you took that. Could somebody just leave. I don't like it. When people leave early bugs. I'm trying to go fast.

1430
02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:05.870
Anthony Taylor: Okay, what I do. Oh, why did that not work? there you go, troubleshooting. I'd rather you guys troubleshoot than do this activity.

1431
02:10:06.270 --> 02:10:09.620
Anthony Taylor: Why did that not work? Cause I just told you.

1432
02:10:09.780 --> 02:10:11.590
Sihong Zhou: plus yeah.

1433
02:10:11.930 --> 02:10:15.599
Sihong Zhou: the last temperature should be, Bob. Right?

1434
02:10:16.180 --> 02:10:21.359
sonja baro: Is that what you were asking your Uncle Bob? Your uncle.

1435
02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:27.800
Anthony Taylor: and there it is right. We can't just change it. In one place. We gotta change it through the whole. This conference.

1436
02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:31.529
Anthony Taylor: Okay, here's another example. Circle radii.

1437
02:10:31.780 --> 02:10:34.260
Anthony Taylor: They die. Rottie

1438
02:10:34.410 --> 02:10:37.010
Anthony Taylor: radar. Okay, diameters.

1439
02:10:37.290 --> 02:10:50.590
Anthony Taylor: Hi. 4 radius in circle, radii diameter pen 2 times 5 times radius print diameters. That's pretty complex. Right? And there it is

1440
02:10:50.740 --> 02:10:55.529
Anthony Taylor: okay. Here it is in this comprehension, the same 4.

1441
02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:59.639
Anthony Taylor: But notice all the stuff we're doing at the beginning.

1442
02:10:59.970 --> 02:11:07.889
Anthony Taylor: That's okay. Cause that's what it's for. So I told you we could take this variable. We could do whatever we want to it before this.

1443
02:11:08.330 --> 02:11:12.689
Anthony Taylor: if I wanted to only get ones that were greater than 3. Where would I put that

1444
02:11:13.740 --> 02:11:15.869
Anthony Taylor: where the radi is greater than 3?

1445
02:11:18.020 --> 02:11:19.389
Anthony Taylor: Where would I begin

1446
02:11:20.100 --> 02:11:23.230
Anthony Taylor: at the end? Right there, right, we would say, if

1447
02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:25.000
Anthony Taylor: radius

1448
02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:28.139
Anthony Taylor: is greater than 3 point. Oh.

1449
02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:30.340
Anthony Taylor: okay.

1450
02:11:31.240 --> 02:11:40.450
Anthony Taylor: actually, I gotta be honest with you. I think this is the best this has ever gone for this comprehension. Okay? And then, if we wanted, okay, now, here's an interesting one.

1451
02:11:40.610 --> 02:11:47.160
Anthony Taylor: It's even possible. Perform a list function. We've talked about list functions, right? What are they?

1452
02:11:47.310 --> 02:11:50.010
Anthony Taylor: Men match some length.

1453
02:11:50.960 --> 02:12:00.719
Anthony Taylor: so we can actually call Max on a list comprehension and it'll create the list. But give us the Max value.

1454
02:12:01.350 --> 02:12:04.940
Anthony Taylor: We won't even see the list. It's just in the nether region.

1455
02:12:05.060 --> 02:12:06.580
Anthony Taylor: Wait. That was weird.

1456
02:12:06.670 --> 02:12:12.629
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so there it is. Okay. That's the Max value in the list.

1457
02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:20.339
Anthony Taylor: Okay. pretty exciting. So there are 2 little activities.

1458
02:12:20.850 --> 02:12:23.440
Anthony Taylor: They're not too tough.

1459
02:12:23.650 --> 02:12:28.389
Anthony Taylor: II would if I were you guys, since you had the whole weekend. Give him a try.

1460
02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:33.300
Anthony Taylor: You're welcome to come to office hours on Monday. If you want to review them with me.

1461
