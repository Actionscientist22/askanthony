1
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.760
Anthony Taylor: Well, everybody. Today's an exciting day.

2
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.649
Anthony Taylor: We got a whole new topic.

3
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.420
Anthony Taylor:  it's a pretty good one.

4
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.859
Anthony Taylor: Okay. It's a pretty good one.

5
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.750
Anthony Taylor: Putting on your thing. I won't comment on it more than this. If if you disagree with it, and and

6
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:43.349
Clayton Graves: you can't understand it, then let me and and I'll get one of the da's to look at it. Okay, no, I'll look at it. I went through it.

7
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.540
Anthony Taylor: You muted yourself.

8
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.659
Clayton Graves: You said I went through it. I said. I went through it again. I went through it. They're they're right.

9
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.460
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Well, but the good news is

10
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.609
Anthony Taylor: you don't have to redo it unless you just want. So okay.

11
00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:59.800
Anthony Taylor: so

12
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.959
Anthony Taylor: visualizations.

13
00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.720
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so the reason so so today, we're gonna do visualization.

14
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.419
Anthony Taylor: why do we do visualizations? This is not a data analytics course. There visualizations are typically.

15
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.169
Anthony Taylor: you know, people think, oh, data analytics, or they're going to do dashboards that they're going to do this. They're going to do that. And that's not what we're going to learn

16
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:33.140
Anthony Taylor: that we're going to learn enough visualizations so that we can identify patterns and trends in the data by looking at

17
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.200
Anthony Taylor: we will that. And and that gives us a qualitative view or qualitative

18
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.220
Anthony Taylor: like decision.

19
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:51.859
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So we can look at the data and go. Okay, well, look, that looks like it correlates. and that's fine. And you can have a visualization that shows that.

20
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.779
Anthony Taylor: But I would still expect you

21
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.700
Anthony Taylor: to do the quantitative check to confirm

22
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:12.729
Anthony Taylor: most of the time. It's gonna be obvious and quantitative checks gonna be fine for like correlation. But there are other things where that's not so today, we learned a lot of like how to get some, some fairly basic

23
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.040
Anthony Taylor: visualizations

24
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.450
Anthony Taylor: with python

25
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:30.889
Anthony Taylor: you can save them as images so like, if you wanted to create a report or something or a paper, you can actually, you'll learn today how to save the visualization as as Png files.

26
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.809
Anthony Taylor: and then you could paste them into a word Doc, or excel or anything.

27
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.750
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and I will tell you, by the way excel is actually really good for visualization. It has a limitation of thought.

28
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.550
Anthony Taylor: while pandas and python limitation of size is based on a bigger computer.

29
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.550
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

30
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.410
Anthony Taylor: alright. So what else? We're going to create line plots, bar charts, scatterplots today using a library called map plot live.

31
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.940
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna do some after we create those we're gonna do some basic

32
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.990
Anthony Taylor: like

33
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.839
Anthony Taylor: customizations modifications to the charts that we create.

34
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.750
Anthony Taylor: And that's really it. For today.

35
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.729
Anthony Taylor: It's not a whole lot. I don't think any of the concepts are horribly difficult.

36
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.180
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we're gonna do that

37
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.350
Anthony Taylor: with python first tomorrow.

38
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.169
Anthony Taylor: Sorry. What is today? Say, Thursday, no, today's Wednesday. So tomorrow

39
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.810
Anthony Taylor: we're going to use pandas. Because the people who made Pandas

40
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.350
Anthony Taylor: said, You know what everybody's using. Map, Potlip.

41
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.570
Anthony Taylor: So why don't we just kind of roll it up inside a pen.

42
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:54.520
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to be able to play with data frames tomorrow. And those data frames, will be able to chart using pandas.

43
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.660
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So which is really kind of convenient

44
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:06.799
Anthony Taylor: today, we're mostly gonna be working with arrays. All right. So the arrays will be our data that we're going to chart.

45
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.269
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So then, these are some examples. Tables can be visual.

46
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:21.499
Anthony Taylor: Pie charts don't even get me started. It's funny problem with pie charts. My rule of thumb pie chart, if you have more than like

47
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.369
Anthony Taylor: maybe 6, and this depends on the size of the 5 charts, but like 6 slices.

48
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.219
Anthony Taylor: Don't use a pie chart.

49
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.510
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

50
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.869
Anthony Taylor: people who put like 40 slices by chart. It's ridiculous, silly.

51
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.709
Anthony Taylor: But there are people that are like

52
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.430
Anthony Taylor: crazy about not using. It's it's it's

53
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.759
Anthony Taylor: way beyond bar charts, maps. Oh.

54
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.719
Anthony Taylor: I would be surprised if we do much maps today or in this class. but we could

55
00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:10.549
Anthony Taylor: and then these are some other cool ones. And I will show you how to find these. When we're done, you will know how to code them. Not that we'll do them in class, but I will show you. Here's where you find the code, the sample code.

56
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:22.040
Anthony Taylor: You can plug this into anything you want, and you can make like the most. In fact, I'll show you. I don't think show you today, so I will show you right now.

57
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.249
Anthony Taylor: So here's some examples of things you'll be able to make with the map plot live.

58
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.720
Anthony Taylor: Which is what we're going to learn today. Simple bar charts.

59
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.790
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna do simple bar charts. We're gonna do line charts

60
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.239
Anthony Taylor: like these more or less. Okay.

61
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.690
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna do scatterplots

62
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.449
Anthony Taylor: which will be will show up eventually. But you can see some of the other things you can do.

63
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.890
Anthony Taylor: They're gonna do a lot of very cool

64
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:59.790
Anthony Taylor: of things, and you can see it gets like cooler and cooler as you go. Okay, this one's funny.

65
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:10.290
Anthony Taylor:  basically, all this is, it's like a full size image and based on the data. It makes the image smaller or larger. It's kind of.

66
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.690
Anthony Taylor: But

67
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.720
yeah.

68
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.909
Anthony Taylor: so all of these are things you can do with map up.

69
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:18.989
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Quite a bit.

70
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.780
Anthony Taylor: This one's one of my favorites.

71
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.260
Anthony Taylor: Some other examples, another another one that

72
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.400
Anthony Taylor: maybe we'll touch on. I know. Brando. See, look at this, they just it just goes on and on.

73
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:44.829
Anthony Taylor: Okay, these are all things you can learn to do. And you're like, Well, Anthony, how would we do that? Well, let's just pick one.

74
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.690
Anthony Taylor: Here we go. And there's your code.

75
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:57.750
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so this looks like a lot. You guys are actually in code all of this today. Everything you see on the screen, you're gonna know by the end to do it

76
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:09.539
Anthony Taylor: all right. So you could actually take this figure out where they're getting their data, throw it into your own python, pull your data in, and you would be able to make this exact same thing. But to your date.

77
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:11.350
Anthony Taylor: okay.

78
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.700
Anthony Taylor: another very cool library that I don't believe we're gonna cover

79
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.630
Anthony Taylor: but I want you to know about it, because it's awesome

80
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.639
Anthony Taylor: is plot. Leave

81
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.510
Anthony Taylor:  partly.

82
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:34.170
Anthony Taylor: But some of this looks like similar to the map flatlift. The difference is, these are all like interactive.

83
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.810
Anthony Taylor: Okay? You can. So you can like zoom in you can.

84
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.890
Anthony Taylor: We could do all kinds of fun stuff with these.

85
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:48.870
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So these are very cool. Platley basically is like making Javascript in the background.

86
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:54.509
Anthony Taylor: And it allows you to do some very cool stuff really, quickly, really, easily.

87
00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:00.789
Anthony Taylor: And those are like the 2 big python libraries

88
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:04.250
Anthony Taylor: that you will see.

89
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.430
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So

90
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:11.790
Anthony Taylor: the whole point of a data visualization

91
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:20.490
Anthony Taylor: is for either you to look at the data and say. I now understand the better the data better than I did a few decades ago.

92
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:26.730
Anthony Taylor: or for you to show somebody else and say, Look.

93
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.600
Anthony Taylor: this is what our data looks like.

94
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:34.080
Anthony Taylor: So the primary goal of data. Visualization

95
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.030
Anthony Taylor: is to make it easy to read.

96
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:43.129
Anthony Taylor: easy to interpret, and it should be relatively, aesthetically pleasing. That is very much.

97
00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:45.500
Anthony Taylor: you know, subjective

98
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:50.469
Anthony Taylor: right? But you interpret is is a little

99
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:57.779
Anthony Taylor: less so. I mean, obviously, somebody who does this every day could make something kind of complex. Go walking. That's fine, all right.

100
00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:03.950
Anthony Taylor: But we're you're gonna see the stuff we're gonna do in this class. The idea is simply to show

101
00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:08.140
Anthony Taylor: patterns or trends in our data vision. Okay.

102
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:15.709
Anthony Taylor: so we have explanatory visualization and exploratory visualization.

103
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:20.039
Anthony Taylor: These explanatory is basically reports.

104
00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.639
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you're not trying to

105
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:29.730
Anthony Taylor: you. You're you're trying to explain a trend or a pattern or something like that.

106
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:34.919
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But the idea is is you are trying to show your findings

107
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:42.830
Anthony Taylor: exploratory visualizations. And we will do these also are basically, I'm doing this to learn about my D,

108
00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:50.780
Anthony Taylor: I mean, and in in the end you might be able to explain stuff with your exploratory visualization. But

109
00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:57.509
Anthony Taylor: the goal is to understand your data as data scientists and AI professionals. That

110
00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.950
Anthony Taylor: is the most important thing.

111
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.840
Anthony Taylor: If you need to do a

112
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:08.430
Anthony Taylor: presentation to management or to your.

113
00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.669
Anthony Taylor: you know, customer.

114
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:19.870
Anthony Taylor: Even if that's internal, you may jump back over to explain its way cause you want something that you can explain. This is why we think this is a good idea.

115
00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.120
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

116
00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:26.880
Anthony Taylor: this is kind of a subtle difference most of the time. But

117
00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:30.390
Anthony Taylor: just yeah. Hi. so

118
00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:38.640
Anthony Taylor: first. actually, the very first thing we're gonna do is a is a

119
00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:45.830
Anthony Taylor: a student exercise. Now, the interesting thing about this student exercise

120
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:47.800
Anthony Taylor: is, there is nothing to do.

121
00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.869
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So I'm gonna put you in your groups. What you're gonna do

122
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.109
Anthony Taylor: is you're gonna come in here. And you could basically just do a runoff.

123
00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.890
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And it's going to show you some data.

124
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:05.049
Anthony Taylor: And then and so this is a table visualization

125
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.300
Anthony Taylor: alright. And then it's going to say

126
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.100
Anthony Taylor: so, just some basic questions.

127
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:18.340
Anthony Taylor: All right, actually, is what the interesting thing is, I'm not sure why they did this. They put like, the salute, like my notes

128
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.870
Anthony Taylor: are in your notebook.

129
00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:35.499
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So yes, these are possible answers. But if you guys come up with other answers to you know, what patterns and relationships are you interested in exploring. How might you use visualizations to gain insight on global app?

130
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:37.970
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

131
00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:48.180
Anthony Taylor: So you look at this data and you guys could talk about it for a few seconds, few minutes. Okay, and that's all this is, here's a bar chart, what? It's gonna ask you similar questions.

132
00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:51.630
Anthony Taylor: Couple of bar charts. You don't have to code them yet.

133
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:54.189
Anthony Taylor: But then it's gonna ask some questions about.

134
00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:58.880
Anthony Taylor: you know, does this change or help? You know what you're trying to do?

135
00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:02.359
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then, lastly, a line chart.

136
00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.320
Anthony Taylor: You're gonna learn how to make this today.

137
00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:13.329
Anthony Taylor: Tell us what this, what this means to you, based on the happiness over time. And then a scatter point.

138
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:16.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

139
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:27.019
Anthony Taylor: so just real quick couple of points about all of these things. So a bar chart is typically some categorical value

140
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:34.380
Anthony Taylor: and the numeric representation of that. Now, what does that mean? So that means

141
00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:38.770
Anthony Taylor: the category is down. Here is your Xx.

142
00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:47.529
Anthony Taylor: I mean, you could have a horizontal. You could have a horizontal bar chart. But we're going to stay with this guy. So our X-axis, our our categorical variable.

143
00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:49.069
Anthony Taylor: In this case it's country.

144
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.140
Anthony Taylor: The value in this case is this happiness value.

145
00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.690
Anthony Taylor: So bar charts are univariate. One variable

146
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:08.870
Anthony Taylor: got it? The variable is whatever the bar itself is represented.

147
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.160
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

148
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:16.480
Anthony Taylor: when we get into line charts, we are also still

149
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:22.789
Anthony Taylor: in the univariate range. But you can have multiple lines on a line chart which is kind of interesting.

150
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.450
Anthony Taylor: But see here again, we basically have a category in this case here

151
00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.960
Anthony Taylor: running across the X-axis.

152
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:33.820
Anthony Taylor: And then we have average global happiness over time.

153
00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.850
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now.

154
00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:41.910
Anthony Taylor: well, yeah, in this case you would have to do average because you're doing a whole year at a time.

155
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.660
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

156
00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:49.650
Anthony Taylor:  and then scatter plots are multivariate.

157
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:56.540
Anthony Taylor: There is no such thing as a unit variant scatterplot. You must have an X, and you must have a Y

158
00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:57.819
Anthony Taylor: at a minimum.

159
00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:05.050
Anthony Taylor: Eventually, when we talk about multilinear regression. we will talk about other

160
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:08.159
Anthony Taylor: axes. We're not gonna have to plot them, thank God.

161
00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:13.440
Anthony Taylor: okay, but you will always have an X and y, so

162
00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:16.590
Anthony Taylor: this is comparing wealth and happiness.

163
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.570
Anthony Taylor: more wealth. more happiness.

164
00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:23.649
Anthony Taylor: That's what this chart said.

165
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:26.150
Anthony Taylor: and there is clearly

166
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:38.710
Anthony Taylor: a correlation for those that don't know what a correlation is if both sides are going up. that's a correlation. if both sides are going down. that's also a correlation.

167
00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:49.149
Anthony Taylor: If the if the plot. If the dots they're all over the map, and you can't see you can't really draw a line through the middle of it that goes up or down.

168
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.110
Anthony Taylor: Probably not a correlation.

169
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.980
Anthony Taylor: Okay, correlations are vital

170
00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:03.620
Anthony Taylor: for us as machine learning professionals. Let's let's just remember what the definition of machine learning

171
00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:09.359
Anthony Taylor: we are going to attempt to make predictions based on path history.

172
00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:15.850
Anthony Taylor: If nothing is correlated. everything was random. cannot make a prediction.

173
00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:26.820
Anthony Taylor: got it. But just because things appear to be correlated does not also mean that you can make a prediction.

174
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:33.919
Anthony Taylor: There are lots of things, and this is where science gets crazy. And you see, like you hear? You know people well.

175
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:44.930
Anthony Taylor: euro people who wear baseball caps and buy ice cream are correlated. So therefore.

176
00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.970
Anthony Taylor: best place to sell ice cream is where people wear baseball

177
00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:52.520
Anthony Taylor: right? Ridiculous.

178
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.159
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but there might be a correlation that we don't know.

179
00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:02.840
Anthony Taylor: So the explanation of that correlation so like this one just says, for instance, does this appear to be a correlation

180
00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.980
Anthony Taylor: just looking at it? The answer's no.

181
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:08.079
Anthony Taylor: okay. We did

182
00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:14.969
Anthony Taylor: quantitatively touch this. Maybe that's a little bit one. But it'd be minor if it

183
00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:19.180
Anthony Taylor: okay. But anyway.

184
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:27.399
Anthony Taylor: okay, so that's what you guys are. Gonna do kind of went over the last part of it already. Now, but you guys can do it.

185
00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:36.830
Anthony Taylor:  yeah, it's just 15 min. So we'll do this one. This is a good one.

186
00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.170
Anthony Taylor: Aye, well, bye.

187
00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.440
michael mcpherson: hey, where's everybody at?

188
00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:46.389
Baro, Sonja: Because it was just so.

189
00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:51.120
michael mcpherson: because because this computer does some really, really crappy crap.

190
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.389
Masarirambi, Rodney: Well, there are today. That's your new one.

191
00:16:55.770 --> 00:17:01.110
michael mcpherson: Is this your new one. Michael. Yeah, yeah. Me and windows 11. We're not friends right now.

192
00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:05.920
michael mcpherson: We're I've been having fights with one drive for 3 days.

193
00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:11.550
michael mcpherson: and I finally got rid of one drive today.

194
00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.659
Baro, Sonja: The windows biased.

195
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:22.069
Anthony Taylor: No problem beyond computer at all.

196
00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:27.729
Anthony Taylor: Say what that at all. I don't doubt that Linda's is having an issue with Dion

197
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.589
Anthony Taylor: the whole different processor architecture. So.

198
00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:44.499
michael mcpherson: But anyway, moving on, I can run about 40 different virtual machines on 40 different things. With this well, then run a virtual machine on windows with windows on it, and try to use stuff

199
00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.859
Anthony Taylor: or run docker even better. You learn, docker man.

200
00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.430
Anthony Taylor: that's some big box right there.

201
00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:55.479
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So let's talk about sorry, Doc.

202
00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:04.829
Anthony Taylor: let's talk about that exercise. There's not a whole lot we can converse about. But let's hear what some people have some thoughts on.

203
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.710
Anthony Taylor: So let's talk about the first question.

204
00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:17.149
Anthony Taylor: After reviewing data set, what patterns of relationships are you interested in exploring? And how might you use visualizations to do so? So don't give me the answers that are at the bottom.

205
00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:23.370
Anthony Taylor: Well, I mean, unless that's your answer. So somebody anybody unmute? Tell me what

206
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.370
Anthony Taylor: what your group came up with.

207
00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.670
michael mcpherson: I usually let let Syndic go over that.

208
00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:36.410
michael mcpherson: She she was rocking it.

209
00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.310
Anthony Taylor: Cindy, talk to me.

210
00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.970
Anthony Taylor: She's like, what stop it.

211
00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:43.280
Sihong Zhou: Okay? So

212
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:52.399
Sihong Zhou: no, she was doing really, really? Well, yeah, after our kind of discussion, I think.

213
00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:58.729
Sihong Zhou: the most kind of happiness. Country are Europe.

214
00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:06.319
Sihong Zhou: you know, and and we think the happiness

215
00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.780
Sihong Zhou: among people kind of

216
00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:20.709
Sihong Zhou: Ver pretty kind of high cause almost the majority of people feel happy between 4 between the range of 4 to 7,

217
00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:27.280
Sihong Zhou: and we discussed a little bit about how to form the X

218
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:33.080
Sihong Zhou: X plot and a Y plot and change the roles.

219
00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:38.240
Sihong Zhou: And yeah, that's our result.

220
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:43.360
Sihong Zhou: That sounds good. Alright. Let's go to the second question. Then I like that

221
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.150
Anthony Taylor: second one.

222
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:50.580
Anthony Taylor: What do these charts? So, referring to the block, the blar charts actually

223
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:58.390
Anthony Taylor: think, Cindy kind of said some of this. But that's okay. what what about on the bar charts? Anybody want to say what they see or what they're thinking

224
00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:08.350
Clayton Graves: based on the bar charts? People that wake up in countries and then have to tell their families. Oh, Crap! Are cutting up all our heads today

225
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:10.300
Clayton Graves: tend to be less happy

226
00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:14.249
Clayton Graves: then those of us that don't have to worry about that.

227
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.470
Anthony Taylor: That is probably true. I'm guessing

228
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:22.869
Anthony Taylor: sure there is a correlation to beheadings and low happiness.

229
00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:25.130
I'm pretty sure

230
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:36.279
Gebrekristos, Hafton: if you look at the Scandinavian and

231
00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:37.240
michael mcpherson: and

232
00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:41.400
michael mcpherson: the orange ones. All of these countries have a

233
00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:46.500
michael mcpherson: a per capita Gdp, relatively high.

234
00:20:46.980 --> 00:21:02.170
michael mcpherson: You know, like the United States is in in the fifties, Denmark, Finland, in Norway, in the $60,000 a year you go down to South Sudan, Togo, the Central African, Burundi, and Rwanda.

235
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:08.940
michael mcpherson: Half the population in those countries are are most of the population and all of the countries right there are

236
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:13.050
michael mcpherson: are at or around the International

237
00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:14.929
michael mcpherson: that the global

238
00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:16.320
michael mcpherson: poverty level.

239
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:20.289
michael mcpherson: which is 2 ter $2 per day.

240
00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:29.659
Anthony Taylor: And and I would say, if you look at like these first 5, maybe 10 countries, they probably all have excessive drinking and legalized pot.

241
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:38.489
michael mcpherson: So that might also be a reason. They're happier again. Correlation, not causation.

242
00:21:52.810 --> 00:22:06.499
michael mcpherson: Yeah, I think we're just in the top 10 top 5, just by myself.

243
00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.390
Anthony Taylor: There you go, because you're so bang happy.

244
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:19.610
Baro, Sonja: I love that, I think what's interesting, too, is. But with both the the groupings right highest and lowest. You don't see dramatic shifts

245
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:21.170
Baro, Sonja: between them.

246
00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:33.140
Baro, Sonja: Remember, on the previous one we only had 2 that were really dramatically different on either end

247
00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.950
Baro, Sonja: right if we look there right? So

248
00:22:36.090 --> 00:23:00.729
Baro, Sonja: so what's interesting? What we were talking about there was not only was the that it wasn't big swings. But we're also looking at like, what more do we need to know about the source of the data to see? Are there inherent biases in the information like, you know how may and what percentage of the data is coming from these different

249
00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:21.860
Baro, Sonja: sources, like, if the Scandinavian or you know the makeup of the data is skewed to have more coming from the industrialized or European, or whatever grouping we wanna call them? Does that influence it, or vice versa? So about that.

250
00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:26.879
Anthony Taylor: Well, even just looking at the data, I mean, one thing that that jumps out at me

251
00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:32.189
Anthony Taylor: right is they. They talk about wealth.

252
00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.009
Anthony Taylor: but they don't talk about wealth, distribution.

253
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:37.900
Anthony Taylor: right countries like

254
00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:39.250
Anthony Taylor: Arabia.

255
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:46.259
Anthony Taylor: There are. There's tremendous amount of wealth like, you know, 40 people that have

256
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:50.589
michael mcpherson: right. There's something I mean, I know that's and nobody else is brought up either

257
00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:54.680
michael mcpherson: in the Orange countries from left to right.

258
00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:59.100
michael mcpherson: Denmark is the most free.

259
00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:11.919
michael mcpherson: Ireland is a little less free than we are in the United States. If you go down to the blue. these countries are all excessively not only poor.

260
00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:14.120
michael mcpherson: but their people are are

261
00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:17.360
michael mcpherson: subjugated severely.

262
00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.059
Anthony Taylor: There you go!

263
00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:31.010
Anthony Taylor: III don't know. I mean I don't. I don't know all the those type thing. What I will say this the one for 1, one observation I wouldn't say about this is, almost every one of these measures

264
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:34.330
Anthony Taylor: are completely your opinion

265
00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:38.669
Anthony Taylor: right? Do you feel positive or negative

266
00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:41.709
Anthony Taylor: you, I mean, and that could change by the day.

267
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:46.409
Anthony Taylor: Right? You know. Corruption. Okay.

268
00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:59.870
Anthony Taylor: that one is a measurable measure. right? But generosity. I mean? You could say, Oh, well, you know people give to more charities, you know, so it's a more generous place. But then again.

269
00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:05.629
Anthony Taylor: I mean almost everywhere in this country right now. There's a homeless person on a red light.

270
00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:08.719
Anthony Taylor: and maybe you give to that person every single day. But that's not measured

271
00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:10.600
Baro, Sonja: right? Right.

272
00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:21.899
Anthony Taylor: you know freedom, I mean. Come on. Yes. you know. But I mean, here in the United States we have, you know, the highest number of incarcerated individuals on the planet.

273
00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:28.960
Baro, Sonja: Well, remember, you gotta reference their definitions right? Not what we think these things mean.

274
00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:40.060
Baro, Sonja: So in this case, yeah, if you're incarcerated, yeah, you don't get to make you don't. You're not very satisfied with your individual freedom to make a life choices

275
00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:46.569
Anthony Taylor: included in this survey.

276
00:25:46.880 --> 00:26:02.349
Baro, Sonja: Right? But it's also my whole point was just to say, Hey, you gotta make sure you look at what they're defining it to mean and to be, not to make, not for us to assume what it meant, cause that came up when we were talking about generosity.

277
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:27.289
Baro, Sonja: And one thing they don't capture, I just wanna put a underline. What you just said, Anthony, is that this is very biased from a Western civilization type of evaluation. Natalie brought out some great points in our conversation around the value of culture and community. And what does that look like and mean? And that's not being measured here.

278
00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:29.900
Baro, Sonja: So anyway.

279
00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:36.029
michael mcpherson: I can tell you that almost all of the these types of data sets are run by

280
00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:55.179
michael mcpherson: banks, economists and government organizations. And they're all they're all based off people taking, you know. How do you feel about your job while you're walking into the grocery store?

281
00:26:55.450 --> 00:27:00.789
michael mcpherson:  this is life's true major part of mind. You're gonna you're going like economics

282
00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:10.070
michael mcpherson: is about economic development. So alright. So let's keep going. I mean, I love. Actually, I could do this for the whole class. But

283
00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:17.230
Anthony Taylor: now we have to keep moving. So in this one, there's really only one. There's average global happiness and average global wealth.

284
00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:24.580
Anthony Taylor: And they want you to tell us, what do you think about these 2 line charts? I can't get them on the same screen. But

285
00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:30.349
Anthony Taylor: that's what they look like. So basically, they look identical, right or anything close.

286
00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:40.860
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So that's basically, you know, is this proving that money can, in fact. thy happiness?

287
00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.699
Mason, Natalie: We were wondering what the plummet was.

288
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.950
Anthony Taylor: That's cause it started at some weird number. Nothing.

289
00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:52.950
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, this is the first.

290
00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:57.039
Anthony Taylor: This is the first data point. So it's really just a badly done chart.

291
00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:59.469
Anthony Taylor: It should have started right here.

292
00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:02.570
Mason, Natalie: Gotcha. So it's always riz. It's always been rising.

293
00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:04.400
Anthony Taylor: So.

294
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:09.230
Clayton Graves: Bill, I love. I would have loved to have seen what Covid did to those numbers.

295
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:16.910
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, these these particular ones don't include Covid. but I don't know, I think

296
00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:23.980
Anthony Taylor: didn't. As a country, anyway, the United States, I'm pretty sure they said that our wealth actually went up during Covid

297
00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:26.020
Anthony Taylor: because we weren't out spending money.

298
00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:36.930
Anthony Taylor: you know, which is checked up is the question. Same people that had jobs. There you go. I like it. Okay, that's a good point, Mike.

299
00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:41.580
Anthony Taylor: Savings not wealth. They're not spending it. That messes up everybody else.

300
00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.050
Anthony Taylor: So yeah.

301
00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:46.839
Anthony Taylor: we are in a country, we we must spend.

302
00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then last.

303
00:28:50.120 --> 00:29:00.369
Anthony Taylor: we have some correlations. What do you notice about the relationship between happiness and wealth? How does this relate to what you learned about how happiness and wealth vary over time? Well, this

304
00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:05.499
Anthony Taylor: agrees with this. With the statement we made here. they seem very much

305
00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.760
Anthony Taylor: related, correlated

306
00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:12.580
Anthony Taylor: right, and this definitely appears to be a correlation. a positive correlation.

307
00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:15.370
Anthony Taylor: Wealthy equates to happy.

308
00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:20.580
Anthony Taylor: at least with this data, right or wrong. That's what the data says.

309
00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:21.960
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

310
00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:27.009
Anthony Taylor:  what do you notice about the relationship between happiness and generosity?

311
00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:33.650
Mason, Natalie: Well, they're only talking about? What was it?

312
00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.300
Mason, Natalie: Donating to charitable causes

313
00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:40.790
Anthony Taylor: so like Salvation Army and

314
00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:42.420
Anthony Taylor: goodwill. And

315
00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:49.579
Clayton Graves: yeah, I mean saving an extra large chip for for a waitress could be

316
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:50.850
Clayton Graves: generous.

317
00:29:51.070 --> 00:30:00.170
Anthony Taylor: But that's not that is paying for service. But yeah, I mean, I follow where you're going that somebody who does that consistently I would consider generous.

318
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:08.009
Anthony Taylor: you know. But but I and I follow. I agree. But I mean this. So when that was just pointing out that this is only measuring.

319
00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:09.190
Anthony Taylor: basically

320
00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:23.159
Clayton Graves: donations that are taxed to the guy on the corner.

321
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:25.880
Clayton Graves: It's not taxes.

322
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:27.960
Anthony Taylor: You can't prove. The point is

323
00:30:54.180 --> 00:31:06.589
Baro, Sonja: we did in our group, too. We start like applying our own thing like. Here's what I think this is, but that's not what the data was measured to communicate.

324
00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:09.389
Anthony Taylor: The measure has to have something measurable

325
00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:26.180
Anthony Taylor: donating or giving money to somebody at a red light is not measurable. That's right. So the only thing that we can use to measure donations to a charity would be tax refund tax reports, and those are deceptible like clothing to goodwill and

326
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:30.480
Anthony Taylor: cash to, you know. Yeah, the cancer society and stuff like that.

327
00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:37.950
Anthony Taylor: So so I I'm not arguing with you. I love this conversation. All I'm saying is

328
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:39.140
Anthony Taylor: is that

329
00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:52.629
Anthony Taylor: to me that is yet another bias. right? Because not all countries even track these things right? And not all people think that giving to good will is a good idea, because

330
00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:56.340
Anthony Taylor: you know, 80% of what you give them is going to go to running the company.

331
00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:06.670
Anthony Taylor: you know, or I don't know if that's true. It's just a number I just made up. But we could Google it. But anyway, okay, so let's keep going. So happiness, generosity.

332
00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:13.349
Anthony Taylor: apparently I don't have any correlation whatsoever. If you're more, you know, just because the country has more

333
00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:18.559
Anthony Taylor: quote. Unquote, generous people does not mean they are happier or vice versa.

334
00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:25.870
Anthony Taylor: just because you're happy. Don't mean, I think that's interesting, because I know if financially everything's going well.

335
00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:30.850
Anthony Taylor: I'm certainly more likely to be more generous. But whatever

336
00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.959
Anthony Taylor:  wealth and generosity.

337
00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:36.190
Anthony Taylor: huh!

338
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:39.430
Anthony Taylor: Correlated

339
00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:46.690
Clayton Graves: suggestion or correlation there, it's just easy.

340
00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:51.179
Baro, Sonja: Well, the more you keep it.

341
00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:58.900
Anthony Taylor: it's I mean, that line line through the middle of this line. But it's gonna be very low.

342
00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:02.710
Baro, Sonja: Yeah, this this would definitely qualify as

343
00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:04.980
Anthony Taylor: no reasonable correlation.

344
00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:11.799
Anthony Taylor: But but I mean, it's a straight line doesn't. Okay, that's it. So fun.

345
00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:13.010
Anthony Taylor: alright. So

346
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:20.249
Anthony Taylor: what we just talked about is really more of a data analytics exercise. Okay, so we have data

347
00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:28.170
Anthony Taylor: and we chart it. We visualize it. And we talk about what these visualizations mean. this is a data analyst's job.

348
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.230
Anthony Taylor: Alright

349
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:36.940
Anthony Taylor: this is this particular one has some explanatory and some exploratory

350
00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.160
Anthony Taylor: situations.

351
00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:49.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay, primarily, the exploratory is more down here in this caterpillar, you can argue well, is it this exploratory? Yes, but it also explains

352
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:55.870
Anthony Taylor: this average. You know, moving across these categories. Same with the spars. Okay.

353
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:58.300
Anthony Taylor: so interesting stuff.

354
00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:02.040
So let's learn how to make these charts ourselves.

355
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:11.110
Anthony Taylor: So everybody go to my solution. Because the first thing you're gonna oh, like, no, this one. We're not gonna do it in a minute. I'm gonna make you guys change the first cell on every single notebook.

356
00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:14.509
Anthony Taylor: But for right now. this one you don't need to.

357
00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:21.779
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to import a brand new library. If if you get module not found, what are you gonna do?

358
00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:25.759
Meredith McCanse (she/her): You won't. Tippin's call

359
00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:36.019
Anthony Taylor: hip, install. Matt plot lid. Okay, not meant plot. Iplt. Just map plot. Thin. alright. So we're gonna run this guy.

360
00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:46.849
Anthony Taylor: We've used this before. This is numpy. If you don't remember, I'm happy to explain. This is going to create an array or list.

361
00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:57.110
Anthony Taylor: It will start with 0. It will end with 5. It will increment in one tenth of a point increments. And it will look

362
00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.460
Anthony Taylor: like that

363
00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:02.020
Anthony Taylor: 0 5

364
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:06.890
Anthony Taylor: death point increments. Okay.

365
00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:09.989
Anthony Taylor: now, we're going to take this list.

366
00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.800
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna run it through a list comprehension and

367
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:17.020
Anthony Taylor: create an exponential series of values.

368
00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:22.040
Anthony Taylor: So basically for each one of these, it's gonna run the X method

369
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:25.310
Anthony Taylor: and give us those?

370
00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:27.970
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

371
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:38.610
Meredith McCanse (she/her): And are those, how did the exponential values get calculated? Is it just. or do we care? Is that not relevant?

372
00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:45.329
Anthony Taylor: I mean, we can see if it comes up. There you go. Calculates the exponential of all elements in the get. Put array.

373
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:49.610
Anthony Taylor: and there's the documentation for it.

374
00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:53.870
Anthony Taylor: Yep.

375
00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:59.709
Anthony Taylor: So that's what that is. So it's I mean for this. It's just generating data.

376
00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:02.869
Anthony Taylor: It's it's both. I mean, it's just random data at this point.

377
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.940
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So once we have

378
00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:10.650
Anthony Taylor: our X, so these will be our layer. X, okay.

379
00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:13.600
Anthony Taylor: and these are going to be our values. Our why.

380
00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:18.090
Anthony Taylor: X goes along the bottom of the chart. Y goes up and down.

381
00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:24.080
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we're going to do Plt, which is

382
00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:27.419
Anthony Taylor: the alias we use for map Flatlib

383
00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:31.190
Anthony Taylor: Dot plot

384
00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:38.300
Anthony Taylor: and then pass in X and Y. That's it. Then tell it to show.

385
00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:48.669
Anthony Taylor: And that's what we made. We made a line chart where X is 0 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and are exponential diaries. Of this.

386
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:56.379
Anthony Taylor: One of the reasons we use that ext just so, you know, is that this curve is very clearly an exponential curve.

387
00:36:57.530 --> 00:37:00.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's what they will always look like if they have

388
00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:07.159
Anthony Taylor: exact exponential. Alright, do you need to remember that. Nope, you don't remember that.

389
00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:10.150
Anthony Taylor: Just understand, that's the curve we were trying to make.

390
00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:18.859
Anthony Taylor: Okay. we can add things to this. So the line chart by itself. Fine.

391
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:24.749
Anthony Taylor: We in this room only understand it because we coded it. We made up the data.

392
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:28.849
Anthony Taylor: but if you were to show this to somebody they'd be like, what the heck is that

393
00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:34.070
Anthony Taylor: so we can add a label by putting PLT.

394
00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:38.350
Anthony Taylor: Dot X label. That's going to be the label on the bottom.

395
00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:43.260
Anthony Taylor: but in a text a string Y label that would be the vertical

396
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:46.919
Anthony Taylor: label put in string.

397
00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:51.859
Anthony Taylor: Then we can plot. So you would do this, and then you would create a new plot.

398
00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.550
Anthony Taylor: and it would look like that

399
00:37:55.930 --> 00:38:02.300
michael mcpherson: pretty cool. So now we're gonna do some trigonometric

400
00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.440
michael mcpherson: signs themselves.

401
00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.939
Baro, Sonja: Hey, Michael, do you wanna mute?

402
00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:10.629
Baro, Sonja: You got some kids in the background. But some kids nice.

403
00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:13.360
Baro, Sonja: Thank you.

404
00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:19.869
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so here, we're going 0 to 6 at point one increments. That's our X.

405
00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:22.580
Anthony Taylor: Then we're going to run sign

406
00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:25.839
Anthony Taylor: on all the values in our X

407
00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:33.260
Anthony Taylor: list and put those in a new list called Sign. or I do the same thing with Cosi.

408
00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:41.560
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, this is important for the next activity. You could put 2 lines on a single chart

409
00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:46.170
Anthony Taylor: the way you do it. Do plt plot.

410
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:51.739
Anthony Taylor: You have to have the same X axes. but you could have a different y axis.

411
00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:59.150
Anthony Taylor: So if you do this. when you show. you will have 2 lines

412
00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:04.990
Anthony Taylor: on the same chart, and this could be 4 lines, 6 lines instead lines. How many lines?

413
00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:07.310
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

414
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:13.040
Anthony Taylor: we will learn how to customize these colors. But before I leave this, how would I put

415
00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:19.219
Anthony Taylor: a label on this pet's absence?

416
00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:23.410
Meredith McCanse (she/her): PLT. Dot X label

417
00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:27.129
Anthony Taylor: perfect, somebody else on the vertical axis that would I do?

418
00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:33.830
Mason, Natalie: TLT dot X label.

419
00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:37.160
Anthony Taylor: That was so close but wily

420
00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:43.010
Anthony Taylor: for going up and down. Is y going across is X. Oh.

421
00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:50.610
Anthony Taylor: but you still do fine. That's good. Okay. alright, that's it, guys, that's how you do it.

422
00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:54.080
Anthony Taylor: That is how we make live charts. You could do this all day long

423
00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:56.750
Anthony Taylor: tomorrow. Yeah.

424
00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:05.350
Baro, Sonja: I was, gonna say, II wanna just put a shout out, do you ever have the humor to put the labels on that exponential graph

425
00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:07.570
Baro, Sonja: time with map plot lib.

426
00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:19.780
Baro, Sonja: Versus how cool it may seem the longer you're with it. That's pretty funny. I think that's good. Yeah. You know what? They're not usually that humorous. So that's good.

427
00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:26.630
Anthony Taylor:  Okay. So with the Oh, yeah, I'm Arizona.

428
00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.810
Anthony Taylor: Oh, I just II did the wrong. But

429
00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:51.939
Meredith McCanse (she/her): nice. No worries. Question about this like, how common is like when you have in your professional experience, when you have data that you need to visualize, do you do it through python? Or do you do it? I mean, there's so many additional programs out there that can help you visualize data? Is python your first Goto, or would you work in table or somewhere else?

430
00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:55.930
Anthony Taylor: Well, and no, not that either. So

431
00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:01.390
Anthony Taylor: for exploratory analysis. I would do quantitative. And that's just my thing

432
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:14.389
Anthony Taylor: if I had to demonstrate it to like management. I'm not gonna throw them like our 2 scores and and say, Well, this score represents this data. I'm not gonna do right. Then I'll throw together some visuals.

433
00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:15.610
Anthony Taylor: and

434
00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:24.940
Anthony Taylor: there are some cool ones that I would use them partly that very quickly sum up. and can be used to explain to management.

435
00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:31.310
Anthony Taylor:  there. But there's also some way easier ones to do. And like

436
00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:32.849
Anthony Taylor: a power bi or

437
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.309
Anthony Taylor: a tableau, there are tools

438
00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:37.370
Anthony Taylor: that

439
00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:46.949
Anthony Taylor: just like this notebook, we have this ability to do visualization. But there are also tools. Most tools these days have at least some built in visualization.

440
00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:49.580
Anthony Taylor: And you can do things like that.

441
00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:53.060
Anthony Taylor: So it's yeah. But no, I mean

442
00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:59.320
Anthony Taylor: this, you know, this kind of goes back to my discussion with you guys before.

443
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:08.290
Anthony Taylor: when these curriculums are created, they're not created with the idea of huge enterprises. We can't be that commercial.

444
00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:14.689
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we can tell you how Rbi and tableau are. The best are the tools that

445
00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:16.430
Anthony Taylor: most of the market are using

446
00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:21.120
Anthony Taylor: alright. But the reality is is, you might not have access to those. Move on your first job.

447
00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:27.159
Anthony Taylor: So here's how to make charts. Now the good news is, once you learn how to make them. Python.

448
00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:32.149
Anthony Taylor: it's so much harder to do than it is in power, Vi or tableau.

449
00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:34.510
Anthony Taylor: that when you get into those schools. It's really easy.

450
00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:41.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's like, Oh, all right, as long as you in here learn what X and Y is.

451
00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.320
Anthony Taylor: you'll be able to do this anyway.

452
00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:49.550
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's again, just learning how we do alright. So let's move on.

453
00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:59.350
Anthony Taylor:  So you have an exercise. Not too bad. You're gonna have this array of temperature values in Fahrenheit.

454
00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:02.320
Anthony Taylor: You're going to assign that to an X-axis.

455
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:07.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Actually, sorry. An X-axis with month of year. How would we do that?

456
00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:11.900
Anthony Taylor: Would we actually type out a list 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1112.

457
00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.270
Anthony Taylor: No, what would we do? Jennifer?

458
00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:19.680
Jennifer Dahlgren: Just NNP. Arrange.

459
00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:25.019
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. One to 13. Yeah, there you go.

460
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:29.950
Anthony Taylor:  And then here's the formula to convert Fahrenheit Celsius

461
00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.229
Anthony Taylor: to me. I just assume

462
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:39.200
Anthony Taylor: you know, when they say it's 20°C. I'm like. that's really

463
00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:40.900
Anthony Taylor: comfortable.

464
00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:48.029
Anthony Taylor: that's all I know to say. I had lots of people in my life that talked about Celsius.

465
00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:52.290
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So you're gonna plot. The Fahrenheit points based on month

466
00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:59.130
Anthony Taylor: plot. The Celsius points in the same plot. If you have 2 visuals. Fahrenheit Celsius.

467
00:43:59.390 --> 00:44:01.419
Anthony Taylor: Okay, in one plot. That's it.

468
00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.040
Anthony Taylor: Okay? All right.

469
00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:09.139
Anthony Taylor: Here we go. Everybody!

470
00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:12.989
Anthony Taylor: So how'd that go? I'm assuming that went smooth.

471
00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:15.379
Anthony Taylor: Anybody struggled at all.

472
00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:21.960
Mason, Natalie: I'm just having trouble getting my. And I'm part of work, apparently.

473
00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:27.789
Mason, Natalie: I'm just. I'm just having trouble getting anything work today.

474
00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:29.580
Anthony Taylor: But show me.

475
00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:34.929
Mason, Natalie: okay. So

476
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:45.639
Masarirambi, Rodney: I'm just trying to run these sales, and it doesn't want to work for me.

477
00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:48.229
Masarirambi, Rodney: Arrange? Arrange? Yeah.

478
00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:51.120
Masarirambi, Rodney: And then one also spelled a range rot.

479
00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:54.050
Mason, Natalie: Gosh, you guys, okay.

480
00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:01.939
Mason, Natalie:  look at the instructor. Example.

481
00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:07.740
Anthony Taylor: Oh, the extractor example there, yeah, that one works.

482
00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.800
Mason, Natalie: Just go to the solution.

483
00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:15.719
Anthony Taylor: Become the one at the top.

484
00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:19.580
Mason, Natalie: Here, there you go. Yes, now.

485
00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:23.359
Anthony Taylor: and scroll down.

486
00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:24.750
Mason, Natalie: Yeah.

487
00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:30.129
Mason, Natalie: that's the one. See little things. Alright.

488
00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:44.019
Anthony Taylor: Those are the things you're gonna want to watch for going forward, because if they catch you. that's okay. Nothing wrong with that. Just realize that you got it fixed and watch for them. If you know that you get caught on that sometimes.

489
00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:55.949
Kanouff, Christine: Hey? Hi! Sorry! I was just gonna comment that she also has that base python thing at her bases. Python 3 like mine was.

490
00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:59.669
Anthony Taylor: Well, as long as it says base, you're okay. I don't care what version

491
00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:05.200
Kanouff, Christine: it just needs to be base. Yeah, that's your main environment.

492
00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:17.100
Anthony Taylor: Well, mine doesn't say base. So what do I need to do to change that

493
00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:22.850
Anthony Taylor: click. select another kernel python environments base

494
00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:25.559
Anthony Taylor: or just do anaconda.

495
00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:36.849
Anthony Taylor: That'll just keep things easier. We will eventually talk more about environments. We talked about them once before. We'll talk about it more, but

496
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:38.910
Mason, Natalie: not right now.

497
00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:40.110
Anthony Taylor: Hi.

498
00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:43.140
Anthony Taylor: so get an Empire Map plot live in.

499
00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:49.610
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna make our one to 13 by ones, which gives us one to 12.

500
00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:55.759
Anthony Taylor: We have our fare and high points. They gave us those we can plot those they will be beautiful.

501
00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:01.569
Anthony Taylor: Is this normally distributed?

502
00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:11.080
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Pretty much? Pretty close mostly.

503
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:14.810
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. It would. It would come across as considered normally distributed.

504
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:18.660
Anthony Taylor: But yet it's not perfect. But it's pretty close.

505
00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:27.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So here's the this. If you did list, comprehension. Did everybody do list comprehension? Or did anybody do like a for loop? What kind of options did you guys come up with

506
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:29.099
Anthony Taylor: for loop, Meredith?

507
00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:35.230
Baro, Sonja: See that one, too? Cause?

508
00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:41.529
Baro, Sonja: Yeah. We were bouncing around the for loop. And then this defining a function.

509
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:44.950
Baro, Sonja: can't

510
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:51.209
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I find list conference?

511
00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:55.049
Anthony Taylor: So if you're gonna do this, you have to have like.

512
00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:58.889
Baro, Sonja: you have to have something to reference. Right? You have to have something to put it in.

513
00:47:59.050 --> 00:47:59.760
Anthony Taylor: So

514
00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:04.410
Anthony Taylor: I mean, you don't have to do all this. But that's all right. We're gonna do it because it's consistent.

515
00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:09.580
Anthony Taylor: Thank you. So value start a pen.

516
00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:14.090
Anthony Taylor: And then you would basically do this math right and run it. Yeah.

517
00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:24.050
Baro, Sonja: Cause we were, we were discussing which way to go like. And then we probably tried to Matt and to both of them.

518
00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:27.450
Baro, Sonja: yeah, okay.

519
00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:29.250
Baro, Sonja: okay.

520
00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:38.020
Anthony Taylor: so yeah, so just remember when we talked about this comprehension, it's just a for loop, basically sideways. Okay?

521
00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:41.890
Anthony Taylor: but yeah. So there you go. So either way, this works.

522
00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:45.549
Anthony Taylor:  then we can plot

523
00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:50.399
Anthony Taylor: X and Celsius. We get that. Now, the interesting thing is, look at that.

524
00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:55.690
Anthony Taylor: They're identical, right?

525
00:48:58.210 --> 00:48:59.670
Anthony Taylor: They absolutely are.

526
00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:01.899
Anthony Taylor: except the Y axis.

527
00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:06.060
Anthony Taylor: that one goes to 80, that one goes to 30.

528
00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:08.560
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

529
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:18.140
Anthony Taylor: alright. But we could do like we talked about. Once we do this. The Y-axis is gonna change a little bit right to give us

530
00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:19.750
up.

531
00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:27.180
Anthony Taylor: You know well where everything starts and finishes. Looks like this. The distribution is still more or less the same.

532
00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:32.560
Anthony Taylor: But clearly Celsius is a much smaller range of numbers than the Faraday.

533
00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:34.960
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

534
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:37.160
Anthony Taylor: pretty exciting.

535
00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:54.230
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So when you come back from break we're gonna configure our line charts. Which just means we're gonna put X's and y's and horizontal lines grids. And they're just gonna make them party.

536
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:56.280
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

537
00:49:56.330 --> 00:50:02.609
Anthony Taylor: we're also gonna do some bar charts. And before the days over we're going to create a scatter ball.

538
00:50:02.810 --> 00:50:10.609
Anthony Taylor: You guys are going to be horribly disappointed in how difficult it is to make these into a bar chart.

539
00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:13.070
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

540
00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:25.030
Anthony Taylor: yeah, exactly. Curry.

541
00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:28.869
Anthony Taylor: Did you guys see what I did?

542
00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:33.390
Anthony Taylor: I just changed that word.

543
00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:35.870
Anthony Taylor: has it?

544
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:39.680
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So yeah, you guys will see that

545
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:41.800
Anthony Taylor: in an example in a few minutes.

546
00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:48.609
Anthony Taylor:  yeah. So I'll see you. Let's just come back. Add

547
00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:53.510
Anthony Taylor: 8, 10. Okay.

548
00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:55.820
Anthony Taylor: parking. Have fun. Break.

549
00:50:57.650 --> 00:51:00.499
Anthony Taylor: Brenda, do you need this answered before break.

550
00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:11.529
Mckimmy, Brandon: I installed everything before this, and it's not showing any data on my, on my graph. And I'm not sure why. Cause II ran everything prior to this.

551
00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:14.839
Anthony Taylor: But sure show us

552
00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:17.979
Anthony Taylor: or show me.

553
00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:24.970
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So

554
00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:32.989
Anthony Taylor: alright. That's fine. Well, Ransom. don't run that first step.

555
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:34.170
Mckimmy, Brandon: son.

556
00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:37.810
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you can't start there. You gotta run the data first. But

557
00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:44.450
Anthony Taylor: okay, I was having the same issue. I was gonna ask about that.

558
00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:50.730
Mckimmy, Brandon: I don't get why this keeps happening. I install these prior. And then I'm running into issues doing the class.

559
00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:54.039
Mckimmy, Brandon: Did you stop? Scroll up?

560
00:51:54.550 --> 00:52:04.430
Anthony Taylor: Don't okay. But I need to see the error message. Slow down. Stop! Xy must have first mentioned, but have shapes 13 and 12 go up.

561
00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:10.100
Dipinto, Matt: You got a 0. You did a 0 in your months.

562
00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:14.750
Mckimmy, Brandon: Yeah, cause python starts at 0, and then you ignore the thirteenth.

563
00:52:15.370 --> 00:52:17.050
Anthony Taylor: Is there a 0 month?

564
00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:20.390
Mckimmy, Brandon: Oh, we're doing it like that. Oh.

565
00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:22.219
Raugewitz, Tania: that's why. Yeah.

566
00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:26.239
Raugewitz, Tania: I'll run that run the next one.

567
00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:27.940
Anthony Taylor: and there you go.

568
00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:32.690
Anthony Taylor: So their message is pretty clear, Brando.

569
00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:37.779
Mckimmy, Brandon: I didn't get it either, for what it's worth.

570
00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:39.990
Anthony Taylor: Well.

571
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:48.119
Anthony Taylor: Python starts with your Celsius. Your calculations are under. But yeah, Celsius absolutely starts 0. I'm sorry

572
00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:58.159
Anthony Taylor: python indexes started 0, but in this case we wanted to label for each month, and there is no 0 month. So you needed to start at one, that's all.

573
00:52:58.790 --> 00:53:08.430
Anthony Taylor: But you're fine. You're both fine. You did good. That's why we're here to learn. Okay, can I ask a question about that?

574
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:11.519
Raugewitz, Tania: How does it know if it's 0?

575
00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:26.809
Anthony Taylor: How does it know that 0 isn't okay? Because if we say that we wanted it 0? Well, it didn't. It really didn't. What if we kind of glossed over the error? But the error said that the the X and the Y were different sizes.

576
00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:28.370
Raugewitz, Tania: Oh, okay.

577
00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:44.560
Anthony Taylor: So there were only 12 values in Y to us. And so we needed 12 months. And if you put the 0 and you ended up 13 that answers, that's logical.

578
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:51.729
Raugewitz, Tania: It's not that it was 0. It was that it didn't match up the values. Did 14 right? You could have did one to 14. You would get the same.

579
00:53:52.500 --> 00:54:02.670
Raugewitz, Tania: So anything other than one to one to 13 would give you that same error. Yeah.

580
00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:04.850
Anthony Taylor: so cool.

581
00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:07.600
Raugewitz, Tania: awesome guys. Go have your break.

582
00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:10.689
Anthony Taylor: Wait! You only wait. You got more.

583
00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:30.130
Raugewitz, Tania: Well, I'm just trying to make 1,300,

584
00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:45.459
Raugewitz, Tania: and and you would have gotten, you know, 100 200 300 for it. So it doesn't care what the. That's not the issue.

585
00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:49.950
Raugewitz, Tania: Okay, I'm leaving my camera on so that

586
00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:59.839
Raugewitz, Tania: it doesn't like not show up. Yes, so that's why I leave it on

587
00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:08.879
Anthony Taylor:  What I want you to use is IPYM. L. Wait. Is that right? No, I don't think that's right.

588
00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:14.870
Anthony Taylor: What's it called IPY. IP. One.

589
00:55:16.570 --> 00:55:19.720
Anthony Taylor: I literally just had it up just a little while ago.

590
00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:24.430
Anthony Taylor: and I closed it. That pot live.

591
00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:28.430
Anthony Taylor: IP YMPM. There we go.

592
00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:32.069
Anthony Taylor: This is the one I'm gonna have everybody.

593
00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:35.320
Anthony Taylor: So now that everybody's back.

594
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:44.140
Anthony Taylor: let me show you what we were just talking about. Clayton tried to jump ahead. which there's nothing wrong with that. By the way.

595
00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:49.400
Anthony Taylor:  In this next notebook the first line

596
00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:50.940
Anthony Taylor: says.

597
00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:57.839
Anthony Taylor: map, plotlid notebook. It may actually run. But it doesn't actually work in Vs code.

598
00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:04.549
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so I want you to instead type IPY.

599
00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:11.280
Anthony Taylor: Mpl. Now, you will most likely need to pip, install this. So

600
00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:15.019
Anthony Taylor: go to code and do Pip, install.

601
00:56:16.580 --> 00:56:18.240
Anthony Taylor: IPY. And PL.

602
00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:21.310
Anthony Taylor: Run that cell.

603
00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:30.589
Anthony Taylor: let it close, or once it's done you can just close it. You don't need it ever again. And then you can run

604
00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:35.560
Anthony Taylor: map potlay by Pym. Yeah. And I like show you what this does. Just thing

605
00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.320
Anthony Taylor: versus in love.

606
00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:41.749
Anthony Taylor: Alright, everybody with me.

607
00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:55.470
Anthony Taylor: So every notebook has map, plotlift, notebook. You're going to change it to IPYM. PF. When you get there and then run it.

608
00:56:56.850 --> 00:57:00.420
Anthony Taylor: Okay. If you don't want this little warning, just restart your kernel.

609
00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:05.230
Anthony Taylor: run it again, and then it goes away.

610
00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:17.530
michael mcpherson: How do you know what you're supposed to hip in plot? Install when you come to an error, cause it says module enough out right, whatever the error message says, module enough out.

611
00:57:18.170 --> 00:57:21.740
michael mcpherson: and it tells you the name of it. That's usually what you want to pick. So.

612
00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:26.769
michael mcpherson: okay, thank you. If not you. You might have to Google it. Sometimes they are different.

613
00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:31.330
Anthony Taylor: but for the most part, with whatever module enough out says is usually what you work with

614
00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:35.300
Anthony Taylor: hoof there. So

615
00:57:36.330 --> 00:57:38.540
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna load our libraries.

616
00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:50.810
Anthony Taylor: And here you can see we're doing all the steps we did in that earlier one. When we did signing Cosine, we're just doing in this one cell. Okay? And then, actually, I'm gonna be all out.

617
00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:53.800
Anthony Taylor: Now, I'm going to do plot dot plot.

618
00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:57.129
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna add some capabilities.

619
00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:01.249
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so X and Stan, that's our X and Y, that doesn't change.

620
00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:11.019
Anthony Taylor: We can give it a line width, which is how thick the line in our line chart will come out like brat will be.

621
00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:15.469
Anthony Taylor: We can give it this marker value, and there's like 10 of these.

622
00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:25.719
Anthony Taylor: and you'll see one. It's going to put little circles in the line at each data point. This one's going to put little triangles in the line at each data point.

623
00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:27.879
Anthony Taylor: we can color it.

624
00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:34.999
Anthony Taylor: and we can label it. Now, you might be thinking, well, is that the same as X and y labeling. No.

625
00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:36.380
Anthony Taylor: it's not.

626
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.669
Anthony Taylor: So. Let's take a look at what that looks like. So when you run this

627
00:58:41.650 --> 00:58:52.730
Anthony Taylor:  when you run this, you end up with this, you know. You see, it looks actually this one didn't even have the line. So this 10, because the line with 0,

628
00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:57.209
Anthony Taylor: right? So we made this line with one run. This

629
00:58:57.820 --> 00:59:03.950
Anthony Taylor: you'd see to be a lion fuel. all right. But say, we don't want the light, I think it looks pretty without light, don't you?

630
00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:08.779
Anthony Taylor: But did I miss it? What I do wrong?

631
00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:15.579
Anthony Taylor: Oh, hey! When this happens you literally have to like reset the whole thing. But

632
00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:19.390
Anthony Taylor: Anyway, we'll get back to that. Okay, so

633
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:25.729
Anthony Taylor: plot that plot you have color, you have label. There's actually, if you hold your mouse over this guy.

634
00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:29.349
Anthony Taylor: see if we can get it to pop up again. It came up just a second ago.

635
00:59:38.010 --> 00:59:38.960
Anthony Taylor: Ger.

636
00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:52.569
Anthony Taylor: Well, we can always go to the documentation, and you can see all the different markers, all the different colors that are available to. and labels. Now we did those labels, but you don't see them, do you?

637
00:59:54.850 --> 01:00:03.150
Anthony Taylor: Well. they will show up eventually. Another thing we can do is

638
01:00:03.550 --> 01:00:06.289
Anthony Taylor: create a like a line.

639
01:00:06.810 --> 01:00:13.320
Anthony Taylor: so that it's a little more clear where it crosses the 0 axis. So we can say.

640
01:00:13.450 --> 01:00:17.929
Anthony Taylor: Plot H line, which is horizontal line

641
01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:22.720
0, 0. So that's 0 x 0, y.

642
01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:25.990
Anthony Taylor: 10

643
01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:27.750
Anthony Taylor: across.

644
01:00:28.530 --> 01:00:31.280
Anthony Taylor: So it's going to go from here to here.

645
01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:34.229
Anthony Taylor: and then Alpha, which is how

646
01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:39.469
Anthony Taylor: transparent it is. So an alpha of one is not transparent at all.

647
01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:45.359
Anthony Taylor: Okay, anything below one, it starts to become more and more transparent. Yeah, like

648
01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:51.360
Anthony Taylor: you're muted.

649
01:00:53.860 --> 01:01:03.890
michael mcpherson: I got an error. Widgets required us to download supporting files from third party. Yes, that's not an error. That's something. You go ahead, and when it asks you that go ahead and say yes, or okay, or whatever

650
01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:07.580
Anthony Taylor: that is correct, thank you for bringing that up, because I forgot.

651
01:01:09.130 --> 01:01:12.109
michael mcpherson: does it? Just download on that?

652
01:01:12.590 --> 01:01:14.800
Anthony Taylor: Well, as soon as you push it, you won't ever have to.

653
01:01:15.970 --> 01:01:16.980
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

654
01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:20.539
Anthony Taylor: alright. So we created, sorry.

655
01:01:22.290 --> 01:01:23.730
Anthony Taylor: said, Okay, thank you.

656
01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:29.559
Anthony Taylor: Oh, you're very welcome. Alright. So when we run this. we're going to get

657
01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:35.819
Anthony Taylor: well, you're not gonna see anything yet. Why is it just sitting here? Hold up! Something's wrong.

658
01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:38.640
Anthony Taylor: It's taking its sweet time.

659
01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:01.990
Anthony Taylor: That's weird. Time was going on.

660
01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:06.930
Anthony Taylor: Restart. That real quick did that work for anybody else.

661
01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.240
Anthony Taylor: Can't imagine why it would.

662
01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:11.569
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I got it to work.

663
01:02:12.370 --> 01:02:18.180
Anthony Taylor: Okay, good. So what you should see when you rerun there, when you run this line. There you go

664
01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:25.089
Anthony Taylor: is in the same chart. Now, if you do inline right, what'll happen is it'll create

665
01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:29.379
Anthony Taylor: a new chart right here with just a horizontal line.

666
01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:32.639
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and nothing else.

667
01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:41.039
Anthony Taylor: So what? This this thing at the top? This IPY. Mpl. it creates a widget, this big white box.

668
01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:45.979
Anthony Taylor: and everything we do to this chart will actually happen

669
01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:48.700
Anthony Taylor: it from multiple cells.

670
01:02:49.310 --> 01:02:56.460
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, I will tell you. If you leave plot that show in, it's going to create a new widget every time a second widget

671
01:02:56.770 --> 01:03:00.809
Anthony Taylor: every time it says plot show. So here we're going to give it a title.

672
01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:03.700
Anthony Taylor: an X label and a Y label.

673
01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:10.949
Anthony Taylor: and it should show up up there what the heck is going on

674
01:03:11.490 --> 01:03:13.000
Anthony Taylor: that is so weird

675
01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:20.350
Anthony Taylor: and being impatient. But

676
01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:25.060
Anthony Taylor: that's very strange.

677
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:08.749
Anthony Taylor: Okay, not sure what's going on. But I'm gonna stop pausing. Is that happening? Anybody else?

678
01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:23.759
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I ran this earlier today and I didn't have that problem, either. So I must have something weird anyway. So we've added a title and a label. And because we did plot show, it's gonna show the chart every time with everything applied to it.

679
01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:27.810
Anthony Taylor:  So we have title.

680
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.450
Anthony Taylor: the Y label, X label. Now.

681
01:04:32.530 --> 01:04:33.880
Anthony Taylor: one thing

682
01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:40.069
Anthony Taylor: and you can't. You know what I'm gonna actually restart it again and show you guys

683
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:50.889
Anthony Taylor: something else. So notice the first time we did this. we can even add the horizontal line.

684
01:04:51.050 --> 01:04:57.039
Anthony Taylor: Notice this little space here. Okay? And add, like, this white area all the way around.

685
01:04:57.220 --> 01:05:00.120
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's not very aesthetically pleasing.

686
01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:02.579
Anthony Taylor: So we can actually.

687
01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:09.179
Anthony Taylor: we can actually get rid of that. So there we okay, well, so far, it's still work. I'm going. So there's our titles.

688
01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:12.759
Anthony Taylor: So here we can say, Xlim

689
01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:16.910
Anthony Taylor: next line. I want you to go from 0 to 10, and that's it.

690
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:25.100
Anthony Taylor: Why, I want you to go negative 1 one. That's it. So we're going to get rid of this little extra stuff here.

691
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:28.060
Anthony Taylor: and it stopped again.

692
01:05:28.450 --> 01:05:38.880
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna fix it in just a second. and then we can also add a grid. Okay. so I'm going to

693
01:05:39.570 --> 01:05:42.099
Anthony Taylor: click here and say.

694
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:45.610
Anthony Taylor: execute everything above

695
01:06:02.730 --> 01:06:03.760
Anthony Taylor: weird.

696
01:06:04.770 --> 01:06:16.300
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So in this last one, we added a grid. So we have. So now you can see the the extra space is gone. We have our horizontal line. Now, we also have a grid.

697
01:06:16.570 --> 01:06:22.350
Anthony Taylor: Very cool. Okay. But notice, we still don't see those labels.

698
01:06:23.010 --> 01:06:26.900
Anthony Taylor: remember up when we created it. We put labels on here. I don't see them.

699
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:29.620
Anthony Taylor: Those are 4.

700
01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:32.059
Anthony Taylor: The work are legends.

701
01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:36.739
Anthony Taylor: so if you want them to show up in the legend

702
01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:41.680
Anthony Taylor: with the label of what it is you have to put it in when you create the axis.

703
01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:43.650
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

704
01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:51.680
Anthony Taylor: And then, last, but not least. If you wanted to save this as an image, save big, give it a path. run it.

705
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:56.309
Anthony Taylor: okay. And then over here you now have the image

706
01:06:58.110 --> 01:06:59.240
Anthony Taylor: pretty cool.

707
01:07:01.410 --> 01:07:07.969
Anthony Taylor: Another thing with this widget. Just so, you know. If you notice it has a little fade button right there.

708
01:07:08.530 --> 01:07:11.009
Anthony Taylor: You can also save it. There, you can also.

709
01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:11.950
Anthony Taylor: like

710
01:07:12.090 --> 01:07:14.000
Anthony Taylor: click and zoom in.

711
01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:16.979
Anthony Taylor: You can

712
01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:20.229
Anthony Taylor: do all kinds of fun stuff. Yeah, sign.

713
01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:26.809
Baro, Sonja: And I just check on. The last thing we did save fig. That was to export right?

714
01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:30.770
Anthony Taylor: That all I did was create this this image, file right

715
01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:32.920
Baro, Sonja: and place it

716
01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:36.820
Baro, Sonja: in the images. Okay, great, great.

717
01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:43.179
Baro, Sonja: Thank you. Cause I was like, why are we not when we have it right here? But we want to export it. Okay?

718
01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:54.509
Baro, Sonja: Right cause. This was just in your notebook, and you want to be able to put it like in a report. Yeah, and then

719
01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:57.949
Baro, Sonja: and you can change it to whatever you want.

720
01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:02.389
Anthony Taylor: There's probably limits to what you can change it to. But I'm I.

721
01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:07.579
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Yeah. Png, probably.

722
01:08:07.790 --> 01:08:18.250
Baro, Sonja: So save fig save fig is the command for exporting a graph. a plot that you've created with map plotlet. Yes, okay.

723
01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:20.849
Baro, Sonja: a plot. Okay, thank you. Yes.

724
01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:25.139
Anthony Taylor: Well, I only call it fact that that's what they call it. But yeah, a graph

725
01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:28.160
Anthony Taylor: created with map out that either one is fine.

726
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So

727
01:08:32.670 --> 01:08:33.979
Anthony Taylor: here's what you're gonna do.

728
01:08:34.330 --> 01:08:39.409
Anthony Taylor: You're gonna take your same Fahrenheit Celsius chart

729
01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:42.710
Anthony Taylor: graph lot.

730
01:08:43.930 --> 01:08:48.129
Anthony Taylor: and you're going to but little crosses

731
01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:50.870
Anthony Taylor: and square.

732
01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:56.729
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And you could, if you wanted to.

733
01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:01.609
Anthony Taylor: up over here

734
01:09:02.370 --> 01:09:09.670
Anthony Taylor: and learn and figure out how to pick different ones. Oh, here's a cool little cheat sheet. Maybe it'll show

735
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:12.500
a

736
01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:18.330
Anthony Taylor: I was hoping

737
01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:21.609
Anthony Taylor: it might be in there somewhere.

738
01:09:21.870 --> 01:09:22.609
Anthony Taylor: Huh?

739
01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:27.450
Baro, Sonja: If this is using an output from the previous

740
01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:37.859
Baro, Sonja: group activity, it's gonna give it to you. Don't worry or you can. If it doesn't, you feel free to copy it from your other.

741
01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:39.580
Anthony Taylor: But

742
01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:45.049
Anthony Taylor: I was hoping it gave you all of the different shape. I know it's in the documentation

743
01:09:45.270 --> 01:09:46.920
Anthony Taylor: all the different shapes

744
01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:52.420
Dipinto, Matt: like, whether it's a square or a circle. Did you find it, Matt? Yeah. I put it in the chat

745
01:09:54.670 --> 01:09:55.850
Anthony Taylor: in the chat.

746
01:09:57.650 --> 01:09:58.790
Anthony Taylor: Where did you put it?

747
01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:09.529
Masarirambi, Rodney: Chat we in in the slack chat just a little bit above

748
01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:15.909
Masarirambi, Rodney: Natalie being the little Captain, we found that we found a couple extras as we're playing around with them.

749
01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:20.460
Anthony Taylor: Well, that's a great place to go get it. And like I said, you can also

750
01:10:20.770 --> 01:10:23.910
Anthony Taylor: come in here and find where

751
01:10:24.930 --> 01:10:26.760
they're adding that. And

752
01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:28.670
Anthony Taylor: it's in here, I promise.

753
01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:30.490
Okay.

754
01:10:31.490 --> 01:10:33.219
Anthony Taylor: there's colors.

755
01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:37.530
Anthony Taylor: Let's do it with Rc. Prams.

756
01:10:43.850 --> 01:10:44.780
Anthony Taylor: hey? I

757
01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:53.989
Anthony Taylor: we're going to get into ticks in just a little bit.

758
01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:57.600
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So got your documentation.

759
01:10:57.750 --> 01:11:01.450
Anthony Taylor: These aren't too bad. Actually, they might even give that to 1 s, let's see.

760
01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:03.160
Anthony Taylor: let's see.

761
01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:07.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So since they didn't, II signed, yeah, I lied.

762
01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:14.629
Anthony Taylor: Just go grab it from your other exercise. They didn't give you the how they finally did it.

763
01:11:15.010 --> 01:11:24.839
Anthony Taylor: So yeah. So if you, since you need to get your Celsius, I don't even care if you just go grab the Celsius Point values and bring that over to up to you.

764
01:11:25.390 --> 01:11:28.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay. alright.

765
01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:34.130
Anthony Taylor: welcome back everybody. Yeah.

766
01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:38.729
Anthony Taylor: It really happened if it's not recorded

767
01:11:39.230 --> 01:11:39.959
the question.

768
01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:42.890
Anthony Taylor: okay.

769
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:48.030
Anthony Taylor: so here we are. So how do you guys do with that? Did you like it? Was it fun? Was it hard?

770
01:11:48.990 --> 01:11:55.020
Raugewitz, Tania: Well, I couldn't get my graph to go to show outputs are collapsed.

771
01:11:56.860 --> 01:12:02.150
Raugewitz, Tania: Did you do the IP L thing? Yeah, we did that in the beginning. Yup.

772
01:12:03.670 --> 01:12:05.040
Anthony Taylor: interesting

773
01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:07.090
Dipinto, Matt: show.

774
01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:13.929
Anthony Taylor: Let's all troubleshoot together. I see Matt winding up. He's on mute. Do you know what the answer is, Matt?

775
01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:27.750
Raugewitz, Tania: It it's just that cells particular output is collapsed. There should be like a ellipsis. You can click to expand. It should be a little error. We we can. Yeah, we can try that. Okay, so I need to share my screen.

776
01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:29.150
Anthony Taylor: Yes,

777
01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:31.270
Raugewitz, Tania: let's see.

778
01:12:32.210 --> 01:12:34.479
Raugewitz, Tania: So right? So.

779
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:37.650
Raugewitz, Tania: damn it, Matt, I didn't want you to be correct.

780
01:12:38.490 --> 01:12:40.400
Dipinto, Matt: I hate being right, too.

781
01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:43.089
Raugewitz, Tania: Happens way too often, doesn't it?

782
01:12:43.170 --> 01:12:55.240
Dipinto, Matt: II was just waiting, you know, I just wanted to have like my one today. And you guys show it because I also like mine. I don't. I ran it, and I don't see anything. So it was

783
01:12:55.590 --> 01:13:01.420
Raugewitz, Tania: over here, not over here. Oh, gosh, darn it! I thought it was.

784
01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:08.880
Raugewitz, Tania: It was over here, not over here, so the little dots were over like there.

785
01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:14.800
Meredith McCanse (she/her): But I think that we have. I still can't get it to show.

786
01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:19.020
Anthony Taylor: How about somebody? Show me

787
01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:23.199
Anthony Taylor: Meredith or Sonia?

788
01:13:23.330 --> 01:13:24.410
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Awesome.

789
01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:45.299
Anthony Taylor: I realize that I didn't have appeared this still, said notebook. So I just updated it. But it's telling me.

790
01:13:46.170 --> 01:13:51.000
Meredith McCanse (she/her): does that matter? Oh, wait! Is this using? No, you need to restart Colonel for that.

791
01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:53.140
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

792
01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:57.039
Meredith McCanse (she/her): But even when I do that it's still.

793
01:13:57.330 --> 01:13:59.579
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Oh, no, it worked okay. It works.

794
01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:01.720
Anthony Taylor: But now run down to there.

795
01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:12.599
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So maybe that was the issue. So Tanya, maybe cause on yours. We didn't make this. We did the pick install, but we didn't actually.

796
01:14:12.810 --> 01:14:19.620
Meredith McCanse (she/her): on this cell where we had the map, poplib, we didn't change it from the word notebook to IPYN, PL. So maybe

797
01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:28.489
Raugewitz, Tania: I just got rid of it. But it still worked. I was able to. Yeah. Once you done with the pip install. You don't need it

798
01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:29.690
Anthony Taylor: right?

799
01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:36.210
Dipinto, Matt: If you were to delete that box altogether, you just wind up with a non interactive plots.

800
01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:38.650
Anthony Taylor: So we don't want that.

801
01:14:39.210 --> 01:14:40.280
Raugewitz, Tania: That's what I did.

802
01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:43.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay, are we ready?

803
01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:47.830
Anthony Taylor: Awesome. So let's get back to.

804
01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:56.139
Anthony Taylor: So we grab it. And we import our stuff

805
01:14:56.380 --> 01:15:03.959
Anthony Taylor: one through 12 just like before. So this is what we did a minute ago. I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on this. Here's the Fahrenheit values.

806
01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:12.949
Anthony Taylor: Here's our cool list. Comprehension convert Fahrenheit values into Celsius and then now we're gonna start making it Party

807
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:15.840
Anthony Taylor: X and y

808
01:15:16.450 --> 01:15:18.469
Anthony Taylor: marker plus sign

809
01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:22.609
Anthony Taylor: color blue line with one label Fahrenheit

810
01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:26.049
Anthony Taylor: for the Celsius to get the little squares. It is an S.

811
01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:31.069
Anthony Taylor: Red length, one Celsius show it.

812
01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:34.299
Dipinto, Matt: Why are there commas after the variables?

813
01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:36.500
Anthony Taylor: I'm sorry

814
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:40.360
Dipinto, Matt: it's Fahrenheit comma and Celsius comma.

815
01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:46.969
Anthony Taylor: Oh, because this so this is the

816
01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:59.559
Anthony Taylor: unpack, variable unpack. So there's actually more stuff that comes from plot plot right? But we're gonna use. I mean, well, do they use that at all?

817
01:16:00.210 --> 01:16:05.799
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, they're using the handles there. So what this does is this simply creates a handle for the plot

818
01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:08.969
Anthony Taylor: called Fahrenheit, and Celsius is just a variable

819
01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:15.760
Anthony Taylor: right. And there's more that comes out of plot. So all we're asking for is the first, the first item that comes out of it.

820
01:16:15.850 --> 01:16:17.640
Dipinto, Matt: They're talking. Cb, talk.

821
01:16:18.150 --> 01:16:20.289
Raugewitz, Tania: CD, radio talk ham radio

822
01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:23.610
Raugewitz, Tania: for your handle. That's your name, your call.

823
01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:32.009
Anthony Taylor: Well, it's also what we call something that's stored in memory. No, it was a good one, though it was a good one.

824
01:16:32.530 --> 01:16:37.380
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So here is for the legend

825
01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:43.430
Anthony Taylor: for the legend. we're gonna use those handles that we created up above.

826
01:16:44.250 --> 01:16:52.289
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And now notice, we also have low equals best. which means earlier. When we did it, it just showed up over the line

827
01:16:52.360 --> 01:17:00.159
Anthony Taylor: with low equals best. It's going to try to find a space with nothing on it. so we'll end up with something like that.

828
01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:02.400
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

829
01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:10.970
Anthony Taylor: And then our X and Y label. And then, last, but not least, save it out 20

830
01:17:13.390 --> 01:17:14.480
Anthony Taylor: pretty cool.

831
01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:27.509
Raugewitz, Tania: How are you guys feeling about these charts? So far equals best?

832
01:17:27.790 --> 01:17:34.930
Anthony Taylor: We had time to go to the documentation and do it. Absolutely not. No, no, maybe

833
01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:42.340
Baro, Sonja: it doesn't take long to right. Click it and bring it up. But Jesus Christ

834
01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:43.880
exactly.

835
01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:46.460
Baro, Sonja: Oh, damn it, I'm off mute.

836
01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:53.129
Anthony Taylor: What was the Jesus Christ for, Miss Sonya. I'm so sorry if I offended anyone.

837
01:17:53.230 --> 01:18:12.969
Baro, Sonja: I'm not offended. I'm just putting it out. No, it it's just frustrating Anthony, because, like I don't know about you guys. But the 15 min goes by so fast and like, I don't have time to go and get I or I didn't know, to go and have that ready to pull the reference.

838
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:30.640
Baro, Sonja: Well, let me see, when I switch over to read the instructions. So so I'm sorry I just. I'm at moding right now, just from a frustration. I don't get the time to like. Do the stuff that you want us to do and get it. So that's why we do it again every morning. So

839
01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:31.760
Anthony Taylor: exactly.

840
01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:43.889
Anthony Taylor: Exactly. You can continue. I don't have to hold the entire class back so. No, no, no, there's nothing in there that says you need to do local best.

841
01:18:43.970 --> 01:18:47.299
Anthony Taylor: Low key goes best. We're introducing it right here

842
01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:52.290
Anthony Taylor: just like the handles. We introduced that right here

843
01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:58.430
Raugewitz, Tania: right. We didn't tell you guys, you need to do that. We're showing it to you in solution.

844
01:18:59.590 --> 01:19:05.839
Anthony Taylor: So don't let that get in your head. It's just. hey? Here's something cool you can do.

845
01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:10.069
Anthony Taylor: But you could have done just like you we did in the demo.

846
01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:12.400
Anthony Taylor: Am I here?

847
01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:15.719
Anthony Taylor: If we go take this

848
01:19:16.850 --> 01:19:20.250
Anthony Taylor: back to here and put it here.

849
01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:24.740
Anthony Taylor: Hmm.

850
01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:29.779
Anthony Taylor: it's probably not gonna work, cause I have weird issues. But yeah, see, it worked just fine.

851
01:19:31.810 --> 01:19:42.899
Anthony Taylor: You understand. these are just additional capabilities. and if you were trying to duplicate the screen, of course that didn't work

852
01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:50.370
Anthony Taylor:  you could. You could. You would have had to look this up and see which one gives you the lope that you want. But

853
01:19:53.610 --> 01:19:57.070
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna think, oh, maybe it's upper right. Aha!

854
01:19:58.410 --> 01:19:59.380
Anthony Taylor: There you go.

855
01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:01.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay

856
01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:06.200
Anthony Taylor: in the solutions. We're just trying to introduce

857
01:20:06.250 --> 01:20:14.529
Anthony Taylor: other ways to do things that you guys could have come up with which I would have expected that or not even upper right. I would have been fine. But just

858
01:20:14.850 --> 01:20:15.820
Anthony Taylor: lower. Right?

859
01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:17.680
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

860
01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:21.899
Anthony Taylor: wait a minute. Could they give you this?

861
01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:29.799
Raugewitz, Tania: No, I don't have. That

862
01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:37.620
Dipinto, Matt: is also the first time we've seen handles. And

863
01:20:37.930 --> 01:20:39.060
Anthony Taylor: exactly.

864
01:20:39.530 --> 01:20:42.860
Anthony Taylor: But that's why we're showing it to you in the solution. This is how we can do it.

865
01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:48.669
Raugewitz, Tania: Yeah, don't. Don't try and figure that out or give us to it before we try it that way.

866
01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:56.949
Anthony Taylor: You know, I could just give it to you guys the way it was written. especially now with a time limit. You know what?

867
01:20:57.980 --> 01:20:59.329
Anthony Taylor: Tell us ain't enough

868
01:21:00.810 --> 01:21:01.990
Anthony Taylor: not joking.

869
01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:09.849
Raugewitz, Tania: Oh, so we're not supposed to have. We don't need to complain about that material during

870
01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:17.910
Anthony Taylor: lecture. If you want to complain, there's feedback system, or you can catch me offline. But we don't need to do it during lecture.

871
01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:25.860
Anthony Taylor: I do understand that you don't have it, and I've explained it to you numerous times

872
01:21:25.870 --> 01:21:28.569
Raugewitz, Tania: place, so that we're good.
