1
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.349
Anthony Taylor: That's good start. Today's another

2
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.350
Anthony Taylor: super cool day.

3
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.900
Anthony Taylor: We're going to continue down the lane chain path.

4
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.949
Anthony Taylor: and you guys are going to learn about prompts.

5
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.900
Anthony Taylor: And you're going to learn about

6
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.650
Anthony Taylor: agents.

7
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.370
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

8
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.450
Anthony Taylor: you can make all kinds of agents like secret

9
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.850
Anthony Taylor: sorry. Aye, for.

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.050
michael mcpherson: Got. That was the prompt.

11
00:00:38.756 --> 00:00:40.050
Anthony Taylor: But yeah.

12
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.280
Anthony Taylor: huh.

13
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.370
Anthony Taylor: okay. So now I I'm I'm gonna be very curious. How many of you feel? You're good at prompting.

14
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.680
Anthony Taylor: Okay, good.

15
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.110
Anthony Taylor: Good. So when we're done today.

16
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.869
Anthony Taylor: I want a year.

17
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.149
Anthony Taylor: If you picked up anything.

18
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.110
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's what I want to hear.

19
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.350
Anthony Taylor: Alright, cause it's pretty good stuff.

20
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:18.310
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So until now, well, let's talk about we're going to do best practices, prompts. We're going to construct prompts in link chain using prompt templates.

21
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.389
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna do llm output with output parsers. That's another really cool thing we're going to do today.

22
00:01:24.074 --> 00:01:31.900
Anthony Taylor: Understand? Basic concepts related to intelligent agents and use link agents to handle queries that require multiple stats.

23
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.330
Baro, Sonja: Yeah, Anthony.

24
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.039
Baro, Sonja: are you displaying.

25
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.239
Anthony Taylor: I I I was I really really was.

26
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.670
Anthony Taylor: and.

27
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.589
Baro, Sonja: Yes, you are. Look at that!

28
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.800
Baro, Sonja: Yes.

29
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.579
Anthony Taylor: I was displaying to me.

30
00:01:48.217 --> 00:01:53.610
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then we're going to create agents that can handle queries and require multiple steps.

31
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.050
Anthony Taylor: Very cool stuff.

32
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.380
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

33
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:07.079
Anthony Taylor: So as you know. So far, most of our queries have just been like one question, and we're done truthfully. We all are pretty much using chat gpt like

34
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.270
Anthony Taylor: Google.

35
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.640
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Well, as I've mentioned to you guys before, that's not really

36
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.120
Anthony Taylor: the best way to use it. It does work, and there's no reason to think it won't work.

37
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.103
Anthony Taylor: Oh, okay,

38
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.330
Anthony Taylor: no reason to think that it won't work.

39
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.769
Anthony Taylor: It's a

40
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.500
Anthony Taylor: It's it's a matter of

41
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.750
Anthony Taylor: getting exactly what you want out

42
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.649
Anthony Taylor: the Llmf.

43
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.089
Anthony Taylor: So the goal in prompt engineering is not

44
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.650
Anthony Taylor: are is to

45
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.690
Anthony Taylor: in as few

46
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.519
Anthony Taylor: lines is possible, and I don't mean lines in the prompt. But okay, so how many of you do this?

47
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.949
Anthony Taylor: I need help with this.

48
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:12.970
Anthony Taylor: whatever this is, and it gives you an answer, and then you go. Well, I mean this, and then it gives you an answer. Okay, how about this? And then it gives you an answer, and you have this conversation, and we're all treating chat, Gpt, and all of these tools

49
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.210
Anthony Taylor: like, we're having a conversation.

50
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.710
Anthony Taylor: Well, that's great. Okay, if you're using a ui.

51
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.320
Anthony Taylor: But if I'm writing a program, I don't really have the luxury of having a conversation

52
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.899
Anthony Taylor: right, because I would have to like come up with some dynamic statement every single time.

53
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.840
Anthony Taylor: And that's just not realistic. So what we want to do is come up with prompts

54
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.249
Anthony Taylor: ahead of time.

55
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.359
Anthony Taylor: That will give us the best possible answer.

56
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:43.890
Anthony Taylor: That's the goal

57
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:59.210
Anthony Taylor: so term prop refers to the text we use when we talk to the Lm can be short or simple or late. They're complex. The output is very sensitive. So keep in mind. Our models have been trained on tons of context.

58
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

59
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.710
Anthony Taylor: the context.

60
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.730
Anthony Taylor: that we're referring to

61
00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.010
Anthony Taylor: is

62
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.350
Anthony Taylor: it can be. It can be altered with just one word.

63
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.890
Anthony Taylor: one slang word could change the content.

64
00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:19.529
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's as simple as that.

65
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.860
Anthony Taylor: So we want to be fairly

66
00:04:22.588 --> 00:04:36.790
Anthony Taylor: specific. And, as you guys have seen, maybe with not so much in the stuff we've been looking at. But when you use chat, Gpt and some of the other tools. You ask you the question. If you ask it the same question 5 min later you'll get a different answer.

67
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.159
Anthony Taylor: or you could get a different answer.

68
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.870
Anthony Taylor: Okay, they are stochastic. There you go.

69
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.569
Anthony Taylor: There's my my fake degree word, stochastic.

70
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.110
Anthony Taylor: Okay, they're random. They just come up. How they come up. Sometimes they come up with the same thing

71
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:53.780
Anthony Taylor: I can.

72
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.810
Anthony Taylor: We always want to look out for AI hallucinations. Does everybody understand what an AI hallucination is?

73
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.820
michael mcpherson: Where it makes things up.

74
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.499
Anthony Taylor: Basically, yeah, where it sounds like it's telling you the right thing.

75
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.049
Anthony Taylor: It reads exactly like, Oh.

76
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:21.270
Anthony Taylor: and you can't so much do this with chat. Gpt. 4. We might be able to do it because you used to be able to do it with 3. But you would say something like, tell me about

77
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.900
Anthony Taylor: Steve Martin's

78
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.550
Anthony Taylor: laundry

79
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:28.840
Anthony Taylor: business.

80
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.419
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And it would just come up with a whole

81
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.070
Anthony Taylor: paragraph about Steve Martin, the comedian's laundry business.

82
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.350
Anthony Taylor: Why? Because you asked the question.

83
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:50.970
Anthony Taylor: and you're like, well, but there is no Steve Martin's laundry business, I know. But you asked me, and the way you asked me made me think there was. So here's here it is. This, is it?

84
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.760
Anthony Taylor: Alright? And that's a new that's like an extreme case of abuseation. Hallucination.

85
00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.539
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but it can happen a lot.

86
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.029
Anthony Taylor: and and we want to try to avoid this.

87
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:13.110
Anthony Taylor: So every but every prompt has to have an instruction. Well, every prompt should have instructions

88
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.970
Anthony Taylor: and questions. Now, instructions are not the question.

89
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.970
Anthony Taylor: Instructions are.

90
00:06:21.583 --> 00:06:25.210
Anthony Taylor: telling the Llm. How you want it to behave.

91
00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.670
Anthony Taylor: giving it a little bit of guidance.

92
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.020
Anthony Taylor: Alright like, like, you know in chat. Gpt.

93
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.520
Anthony Taylor: you have

94
00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.130
Anthony Taylor: these.

95
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.669
Anthony Taylor: Okay custom instructions.

96
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.319
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's all. This is that's the instruction

97
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.169
Anthony Taylor: you can put whatever you want in.

98
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:52.900
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

99
00:06:53.365 --> 00:06:58.119
Anthony Taylor: and and it'll you'll it'll it should work and do something for you.

100
00:06:59.186 --> 00:07:05.200
Anthony Taylor: We're going to be doing this in lane chain because we want to control the instructions of our chat.

101
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.309
Anthony Taylor: The question is just the question.

102
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.560
Anthony Taylor: tell me about puppets

103
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.250
Anthony Taylor: all right.

104
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:20.410
Anthony Taylor: optional things you could put in there. And this is the part that I'm betting all of you that raised your hand probably don't do.

105
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:22.600
Anthony Taylor: and that is

106
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:23.730
Anthony Taylor: like.

107
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:27.579
Anthony Taylor: give it an example of what the answer should look like.

108
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.470
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Or

109
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.539
Anthony Taylor: give it additional information

110
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:42.010
Anthony Taylor: that, like, well, you're going to see some examples of this, but additional information in the question.

111
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:49.769
Anthony Taylor: So that it kind of understands what you're looking for. Now, that sounds like an example. No, an example has more to do with format.

112
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:56.898
Anthony Taylor: Okay, input data is, and I'll use the example we're going to use here in class.

113
00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.506
Anthony Taylor: you know. I say,

114
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:05.030
Anthony Taylor: I I recommend a shark movie. I like jaws and the make.

115
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.349
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we've given it additional information.

116
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:16.969
Anthony Taylor: It's like, Oh, well, Jos is a great movie. And but then it'll give you an answer. But it's using that additional information in prompt.

117
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:18.670
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

118
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.080
Anthony Taylor: alright. Oh, there we go.

119
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:25.730
Anthony Taylor: So assim a regular prompt. Write me a dad joke about penguins.

120
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now, technically.

121
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.820
Anthony Taylor: we have given it

122
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.520
Anthony Taylor: additional information.

123
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:38.180
Anthony Taylor: We gave it a little bit of an instruction here.

124
00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:39.539
Anthony Taylor: Dad, joke.

125
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.179
Anthony Taylor: hey?

126
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:45.660
Anthony Taylor: That joke is, will like, specify the tone

127
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.180
Anthony Taylor: of the response.

128
00:08:48.982 --> 00:08:53.039
Anthony Taylor: Why don't people like talk strangers at parties? Because they find it hard

129
00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.760
Anthony Taylor: to break the ice?

130
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:56.450
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

131
00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:09.239
Anthony Taylor: but oh, here's the shark. So in this case we got an example. We're gonna say, you're looking for something to watch tonight. You're in the mood for killer shark. You can improve the chances of the model suggesting the right thing by adding, input.

132
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:17.059
Anthony Taylor: And here you can see recommended movie about killer shark. I like jaws, darlos, and water. I don't like Shark NATO or the maid

133
00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:20.589
Anthony Taylor: right? So now

134
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.829
Anthony Taylor: we've given it more information to give us an answer.

135
00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:30.139
Anthony Taylor: So this is a better prompt than give me a movie

136
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.729
Anthony Taylor: about a killer shark.

137
00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:33.860
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

138
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:41.099
Anthony Taylor: And and and then, okay, so now let's get into some of the terminology.

139
00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.080
Anthony Taylor: What? You know, a terminology

140
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:51.309
Anthony Taylor: prompting there is such thing is called 0 shot prompting. This is what most of us do today.

141
00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.020
Anthony Taylor: We just asked questions.

142
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.960
Anthony Taylor: no additional information, no instruction.

143
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:59.289
Anthony Taylor: and no example.

144
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.020
Anthony Taylor: And it gives us an answer.

145
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:02.840
Anthony Taylor: Nothing wrong with that answer.

146
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.139
Anthony Taylor: It's a great answer.

147
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:06.470
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

148
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:11.299
Anthony Taylor: one shot. We're going to tell it something.

149
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:16.439
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're going to give it a piece of data. We could even give it an example at this point.

150
00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:22.590
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to say, Hey, I like jaws, and then it's like, Okay, well, if you like, jaws

151
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.870
Anthony Taylor: check out this one.

152
00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:28.210
Anthony Taylor: Now, notice, it was smart enough to understand

153
00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:35.179
Anthony Taylor: that if you've seen jaws, and it's your favorite, we're not going to recommend jaws.

154
00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.090
Anthony Taylor: Ted.

155
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:43.810
Anthony Taylor: do we get into more of these?

156
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:51.879
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So those are like the most basics. And this is what most people do. 0 shot or one shot.

157
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:52.900
Anthony Taylor: Hey?

158
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:56.189
Anthony Taylor: We have additional types.

159
00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:59.549
Anthony Taylor: And that is, you shot.

160
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.670
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

161
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:03.070
Anthony Taylor: so

162
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.000
Anthony Taylor: with few shots.

163
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:14.790
Anthony Taylor: It's basically closer to what we did on the one I like jaws. The shallows open water. I don't like Shark Vidal on the movie.

164
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:17.539
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So we gave them 2 to 5 examples.

165
00:11:17.956 --> 00:11:21.420
Anthony Taylor: And this should refine our model. So here, for sure.

166
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.389
Anthony Taylor: we have a better and another more clear answer.

167
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:28.940
Anthony Taylor: Now, if we would have done the one shot

168
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.380
Anthony Taylor: this one.

169
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.369
Anthony Taylor: and it's like, Oh, well, I've already seen jaws.

170
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:41.159
Anthony Taylor: So today, what would we do in chat. Gpt, we'd go recommend a movie about killer shark. Oh, jaws! I've seen jobs. And then it gives us another one.

171
00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:43.400
Anthony Taylor: Okay, which

172
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.260
Anthony Taylor: pretty much this would have covered in one prompt.

173
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:58.099
Anthony Taylor: Then the next one it gives us. We've seen that one, too, or it's Sharkmado, or it's the make, and we're like, oh, I don't like that. So what do we do? We add another comment. I don't like Sharknado meeting.

174
00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:59.779
Anthony Taylor: I don't like the mail.

175
00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:03.520
Anthony Taylor: and we end up with like 5 6 lines. And eventually

176
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:04.680
Anthony Taylor: we get

177
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:08.410
Anthony Taylor: something that fits our actual preference.

178
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:11.380
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so this

179
00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:13.860
Anthony Taylor: is way better than

180
00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.160
Anthony Taylor: the the one shot.

181
00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.719
Anthony Taylor: Prompts. Okay?

182
00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.930
Anthony Taylor: And again, I guess, depends on you know what you care.

183
00:12:23.609 --> 00:12:27.449
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So chain of thought. Prompting is another type of prompt.

184
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.130
Anthony Taylor: And

185
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.960
Anthony Taylor: this one,

186
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:33.110
Anthony Taylor: is.

187
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:35.139
Anthony Taylor: I do.

188
00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:42.329
Anthony Taylor: Well, I want you guys to look at this first one. And this is the best way to explain. So here we're asking you a question.

189
00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.940
Anthony Taylor: and and we're showing it the answer.

190
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.649
Anthony Taylor: And then in the next one we ask it

191
00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.650
Anthony Taylor: another question that is in a similar format.

192
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.970
Anthony Taylor: The model will output. The answer is, 27.

193
00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:59.060
Anthony Taylor: But that's not really, I mean. And notice the answer.

194
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.060
Anthony Taylor: it's wrong.

195
00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:05.240
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I see that

196
00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:09.009
Anthony Taylor: you'll notice that right away. But that's not the right answer.

197
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:17.129
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So what we want to do is we want the model to think it out. Well, how do we do that?

198
00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:20.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Because the models don't understand word problems.

199
00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:27.990
Anthony Taylor: So the way we can do that is, we give it the same question. And we talk about how did we come up with? The answer is 11.

200
00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:34.759
Anthony Taylor: Roger started with 5 balls, 2 cans, 3 tennis balls each, 6 tennis balls, 5, 6, and 11.

201
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:38.360
Anthony Taylor: Okay, the answer is 11.

202
00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:40.940
Anthony Taylor: So now, when we tell it this.

203
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:43.290
Anthony Taylor: it actually thinks it out.

204
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:51.249
Anthony Taylor: Cafeteria 23 apples. They use 20 to make lunch. So they had 23 minus 20. They bought 6 more apples, 3 plus 6. The answer is not

205
00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.230
Anthony Taylor: pretty cool.

206
00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:57.430
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

207
00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.980
Anthony Taylor: And now it got

208
00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:08.140
Anthony Taylor: so this is chain of thought prompting. We're basically providing a step by step. This is how you will do it.

209
00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:10.880
Anthony Taylor: Now, here's the question I want you to answer.

210
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:22.549
Anthony Taylor: okay, and you can do this with a very simple example. It doesn't have to be as complicated. In fact, that's kind of the point is you can use a simple example.

211
00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:27.200
Anthony Taylor: show it to the model, and as long as it's the same basic steps

212
00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:29.130
Anthony Taylor: it'll go

213
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:31.530
Anthony Taylor: alright.

214
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:38.139
Anthony Taylor: okay. Another thing you could do to get rid of hallucinations.

215
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:44.160
Anthony Taylor: We know 2 things right now to get rid of hallucinations. Well, we know one before this. What's the one way right now

216
00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:46.200
Anthony Taylor: that we already know we learned yesterday.

217
00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.349
Derek Rikke: Turn the temperature down.

218
00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.819
Anthony Taylor: Thank you, Derek.

219
00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:59.180
Anthony Taylor: We got to turn it down. Make it cold.

220
00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:04.089
Anthony Taylor: Okay. We want it to be as low as possible. That gets rid of all hallucinations.

221
00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:10.240
Anthony Taylor: The other way that will reduce the risk of hallucinations is to have it give you citations.

222
00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.989
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you can ask it

223
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:20.589
Anthony Taylor: for reliable sources and citation. Now, just because you say this, does that mean? You're guaranteed not to get hallucination?

224
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:25.589
Anthony Taylor: The answer is, no.

225
00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.230
Anthony Taylor: it can still hallucinate, based on what it read.

226
00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:32.760
Anthony Taylor: what it pulled in it could go look at it and go, hey?

227
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.780
Anthony Taylor: yeah.

228
00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:42.090
Anthony Taylor: I gotta be honest with you. I never knew python was named after the British comedy group, Monty Python.

229
00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:46.740
Anthony Taylor: I just learned some

230
00:15:49.568 --> 00:15:54.250
Anthony Taylor: okay. So then the last thing we're gonna cover is

231
00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.420
Anthony Taylor: basically instructions.

232
00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:01.979
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So this is like I showed you on chat Dpt. They've had this in there for quite a while.

233
00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.600
Anthony Taylor: Instructions allow us

234
00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:05.820
Anthony Taylor: to

235
00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:11.369
Anthony Taylor: basically tell the model. And and I do this. I've been doing this for a long time

236
00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:16.720
Anthony Taylor: year, and I mean, I have a chat. Tbt, that is a, I call it the data professor.

237
00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:25.859
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And every answer it gives is as if it was the teacher trying to teach, not trying to just give you the answer

238
00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:27.740
Anthony Taylor: right?

239
00:16:28.122 --> 00:16:31.789
Anthony Taylor: Which is sometimes a pain in the butt, because it talks too much.

240
00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:33.790
Anthony Taylor: But whatever

241
00:16:34.496 --> 00:16:39.690
Anthony Taylor: but here you're a helpful assistant that translates English to Spanish, translate the following passes.

242
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:41.910
Anthony Taylor: okay? And then boom, it does it.

243
00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:45.589
Anthony Taylor: Now, could you have just said, translate following Pat, maybe

244
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:48.509
Anthony Taylor: you might have been able to do that?

245
00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:50.910
Anthony Taylor: but

246
00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:56.509
Anthony Taylor: by doing this it will keep this instruction until you start a new chat.

247
00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:00.799
Anthony Taylor: So from this point forward you can just

248
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:01.780
Anthony Taylor: give it.

249
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.990
Anthony Taylor: you know, were phrases, and it'll convert them.

250
00:17:07.843 --> 00:17:14.280
Anthony Taylor: So other instruction. Well, yeah. So here you could say.

251
00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:18.329
Anthony Taylor: I don't. I don't like this. I mean, maybe it's true.

252
00:17:18.722 --> 00:17:22.230
Anthony Taylor: I haven't seen this to be true yet, but it could be.

253
00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:27.760
Anthony Taylor: Write a sentence with ten's word, 10 words in it, 123-45-6789.

254
00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.069
Anthony Taylor: That's only 9 words in caps.

255
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:36.220
Anthony Taylor: Oh, I apologize for that. Here's another sentence today.

256
00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:45.259
Anthony Taylor: I mean, honestly, you could have just said, that's only 9 words. They're claiming that they respond to caps and exclamation points.

257
00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:56.959
Anthony Taylor: The the. The truth is, is, you're gonna get. Maybe you get this. But honestly, I've caught it wrong a couple of times, and it always apologizes every time. Oh, can you do it this way? Oh, I'm sorry I misunderstood.

258
00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.719
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but whatever maybe this is something

259
00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.029
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. I haven't tried this one.

260
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:04.930
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

261
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:09.230
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So with all of this.

262
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:11.839
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna start talking about

263
00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:12.970
Anthony Taylor: templates.

264
00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:22.129
Anthony Taylor: Now, templates are lame chain objects that we're going to create. That will basically do a lot of the stuff. Well.

265
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.619
Anthony Taylor: well, nearly any of the stuff we just talked about

266
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:28.699
Anthony Taylor: that requires. And here's where it comes

267
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:32.040
Anthony Taylor: a prompt engineering task

268
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.759
Anthony Taylor: to come up with

269
00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.580
Anthony Taylor: what is going to give me the answer

270
00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:44.179
Anthony Taylor: or my user the answer in the least number of

271
00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.390
Anthony Taylor: questions.

272
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.760
Anthony Taylor: That's your goal.

273
00:18:49.950 --> 00:19:01.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And also keep in mind. Not all of this is used in chat bots. I know we're kind of talking about it in terms of chat bot. But the reality is is I mean, you could write a program

274
00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:02.550
Anthony Taylor: that.

275
00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:14.819
Anthony Taylor: you know, looks at data that a user entered into a table and does something on it based on that value in the table. And I'm not talking about a question it could be.

276
00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.489
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. They they

277
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.160
Anthony Taylor: someone put

278
00:19:21.056 --> 00:19:21.849
Anthony Taylor: phone number

279
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.099
Anthony Taylor: in the table.

280
00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.420
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

281
00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:27.220
Anthony Taylor: right? So what do we want to do with that phone number?

282
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:40.400
Anthony Taylor: Well, maybe with that phone number we want to go grab their address, if May, you know. Do some lookups grab their address information, grab their, you know, whatever information we can from that phone number and then mask it

283
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.499
Anthony Taylor: now. Yes, you could write a fairly

284
00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:46.529
Anthony Taylor: big application

285
00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:47.829
Anthony Taylor: to do that

286
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:49.860
Anthony Taylor: without an Llm.

287
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:51.399
Anthony Taylor: But with an L,

288
00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.939
Anthony Taylor: it's like 3 or 4 lines.

289
00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.929
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's really simple, because the Lm can go do that work for you

290
00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:10.759
Anthony Taylor: right? So there's no reason to believe you can't use Llf. If you wanted to translate. If you wanted to translate your data in your application.

291
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:16.190
Anthony Taylor: you could create an Api that sends the data through an Llm.

292
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.179
Anthony Taylor: Translates it and writes it back.

293
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:24.389
Anthony Taylor: Now, that may not be the best use of an Ln, because you can usually translate for cheaper than that, but

294
00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:26.399
Anthony Taylor: it can be done.

295
00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.649
Anthony Taylor: The world is available. Yes, sir.

296
00:20:30.627 --> 00:20:39.929
Baro, Sonja: Could you just restate? You said the goal of the prompt engineer is to get the response. Did you say? With the least amount of lines.

297
00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:42.379
Anthony Taylor: Least amount of interaction, the least amount.

298
00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.390
Baro, Sonja: Amount of interaction. Okay?

299
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:48.349
Anthony Taylor: So your prompt in the in linkchain could be hundreds of lines long

300
00:20:48.934 --> 00:20:54.429
Anthony Taylor: right? But you want them to be able to go. I want blah blah blah, and they get the answer.

301
00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:55.780
Baro, Sonja: Okay.

302
00:20:56.370 --> 00:21:00.890
Anthony Taylor: Okay, even though they really needed this hundreds of lines long prompt.

303
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.850
Anthony Taylor: you can give them the answer

304
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.130
Anthony Taylor: in one question.

305
00:21:05.059 --> 00:21:08.649
Anthony Taylor: That's your goal. Most of the time. You really don't need them

306
00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:17.439
Anthony Taylor: talking too much and truthfully, I find, or you have to talk in there. The more you get into hallucinations or just wrong answer.

307
00:21:17.936 --> 00:21:23.139
Anthony Taylor: I cannot tell you how many times, while using these tools, I just get the wrong answer

308
00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:31.650
Anthony Taylor: right? And then I I always go down this rabbit hole. I'm getting better about not doing it, and that is, I wanted to give me the right answer.

309
00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:43.399
Anthony Taylor: I knew the answer when we started, but I didn't want to type it. So there's I went over that. That's not it it. That's not it, either. And then you go through. And then it's like.

310
00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:49.389
Anthony Taylor: you know. 20 min later something would have taken me a minute to type. I'm I'm still messing with.

311
00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.280
Anthony Taylor: So yeah, you gotta watch for that.

312
00:21:52.400 --> 00:22:01.740
Anthony Taylor: So anyway, so developing melodramits is the most effective strategy available for prompting thorough, accurate responses from a transformable model.

313
00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:06.150
Anthony Taylor: And we're going to do that in linkchain.

314
00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.810
Masarirambi, Rodney: Or before we start. I got a quick question.

315
00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:10.380
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

316
00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:13.535
Masarirambi, Rodney: So. You were saying that.

317
00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.760
Masarirambi, Rodney: you know,

318
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:25.371
Masarirambi, Rodney: wanted to avoid hallucinations, and being in the in in a continuous conversation like will lead to that way. Without obviously.

319
00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:26.350
Anthony Taylor: Can.

320
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:45.070
Masarirambi, Rodney: Right. So without, you know, without actually having been like, you know, in the system where where we've seen it happen, and not knowing the background of it is, this is the hallucinations like what tends to happen like when people get all those weird answers from like the chat agents and stuff like that? Or is that something else.

321
00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:52.409
Anthony Taylor: It. It can be that I mean, it could be a lot of different things hallucination is simply

322
00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:57.499
Anthony Taylor: the model. Think is the the model has a high. If we talk about a technic.

323
00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:02.639
Anthony Taylor: a hallucination is the model feels there's a high probability is giving you the correct answer.

324
00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.510
Anthony Taylor: But it's not the correct answer.

325
00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.410
Anthony Taylor: And unfortunately.

326
00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:11.719
Anthony Taylor: you, if you're not, if it's if you're asking about something you don't know about.

327
00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.010
Anthony Taylor: you probably won't even know it's a loose

328
00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.530
Anthony Taylor: right. And they and one of the things about prompt.

329
00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:19.450
Anthony Taylor: most pro or

330
00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.670
Anthony Taylor: like for imagine. And again, I think this comes up somewhere in today's lesson.

331
00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.010
Anthony Taylor: Imagine

332
00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:27.960
Anthony Taylor: like, if I'm asking you how to treat a patient.

333
00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:29.240
Anthony Taylor: hey?

334
00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:36.389
Anthony Taylor: So you have a headache, or something, or or an illness right? And you type in. How do they keep this?

335
00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.239
Anthony Taylor: It'll answer it, based on what it knows.

336
00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:40.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

337
00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:42.850
Anthony Taylor: but a good prompt

338
00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:45.370
Anthony Taylor: that is actually useful

339
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:48.180
Anthony Taylor: might need an actual doctor

340
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:50.019
Anthony Taylor: to write the prompt

341
00:23:50.780 --> 00:24:00.119
Anthony Taylor: right? He's gonna put in symptoms. He's gonna put in lab tests. He's gonna put in all of this information and then go, what's the best way to handle this?

342
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:06.919
Anthony Taylor: That answer is a bazillion times better than the random answer we might get

343
00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:09.420
Anthony Taylor: okay.

344
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:14.549
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So in this activity, you got coming up. It's not as coding one.

345
00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:19.530
Anthony Taylor: You're going to engineer a series of and you can't, and if you don't have chat, tpt.

346
00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:21.289
Anthony Taylor: but you can use the free version.

347
00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:27.850
Anthony Taylor: you can also use, like the Openai playground if you want whatever. But

348
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:34.109
Anthony Taylor: you're going to try to create good prompts. Following the instructions, and that's really it.

349
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:35.799
Anthony Taylor: Just have fun with it.

350
00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:37.400
Anthony Taylor: Kind of give it a go

351
00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.619
Anthony Taylor: take like 1015 min to knock this out.

352
00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:46.200
Anthony Taylor: How did that go?

353
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:50.890
Anthony Taylor: Anybody come up with any interesting.

354
00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:55.570
Clayton Graves: We we made. We made ours recommend a true crime vacation

355
00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.109
Clayton Graves: based on 0,

356
00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.699
Clayton Graves: and we made it pretend it was Samuel L. Jackson.

357
00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.919
Anthony Taylor: Oh, did it do? Did it work? I said, Hello, Jackson! That's kind of cool.

358
00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:06.569
Clayton Graves: Hold onto our bucks.

359
00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:09.740
Anthony Taylor: Huh? Huh?

360
00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:14.760
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

361
00:25:15.507 --> 00:25:19.660
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Well, that's cool. I love that hold on your books.

362
00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:21.259
Anthony Taylor: Very funny.

363
00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:23.299
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So

364
00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:29.340
Anthony Taylor: I mean, any questions about that there's really not a lot to talk about with that other than did you guys

365
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:34.150
Anthony Taylor: see the difference? Did you try different templates to get different responses?

366
00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:36.360
Anthony Taylor: It's one of those things that

367
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.790
Anthony Taylor: when you're using like Chat, Gpt, or any client.

368
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:43.289
Anthony Taylor: it's not going to be as obvious.

369
00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:44.390
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

370
00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.040
Anthony Taylor: because you can have a conversation.

371
00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:55.670
Anthony Taylor: Okay, your goal would be to try to take that conversation and figure out how to make it

372
00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:56.760
Anthony Taylor: just

373
00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.480
Anthony Taylor: what you know, an instruction and a prompt

374
00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:00.999
Anthony Taylor: that kind of thing. Yeah. Gate.

375
00:26:02.935 --> 00:26:08.119
Vasquez, Gabriel: One of the things I like to do when like creating prompts is I

376
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:21.720
Vasquez, Gabriel: always started off with Create me a prompt for an AI, and then I put in the the requirement like whatever I want to ask in, and then I'll just create me a detailed prompt, and then I could just change it to. However, I want it.

377
00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:31.339
Anthony Taylor: There you go. I like that. There's and there are. There are actually a lot of like Gpts and tools out there that will that have like

378
00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:37.429
Anthony Taylor: thought of all of the different ways to make props, and you could just like, tell it what you want. And then it builds you

379
00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:41.745
Anthony Taylor: an appropriate prompt. There's some good ones for like that'll make like

380
00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.739
Anthony Taylor: stable diffusion, prompts and stuff like that.

381
00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:47.540
Anthony Taylor: Bye?

382
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:49.220
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

383
00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:52.580
Anthony Taylor: right.

384
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:54.380
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So

385
00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:56.930
Anthony Taylor: now that we kind of got the gist

386
00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.300
Anthony Taylor: of of prompt

387
00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:04.710
Anthony Taylor: discussion. And I mean, and obviously, there's a lot more to engineering.

388
00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:13.020
Anthony Taylor: Then there is, and what we just talked about. But the idea of that conversation was to get you to understand that

389
00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:14.830
Anthony Taylor: Google prompts.

390
00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:19.499
Anthony Taylor: Okay, no shot prompts are actually not the best way to do it.

391
00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:27.049
Anthony Taylor: Nothing wrong with it, if you don't mind talking to it for a while, but if you want the answer quickly, add a few sentences and

392
00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:28.829
Anthony Taylor: bang! It'll be better.

393
00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.250
Anthony Taylor: Hi, so in

394
00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.980
Anthony Taylor: lynching.

395
00:27:34.611 --> 00:27:37.840
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna start. We have like roles.

396
00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:45.350
Anthony Taylor: Okay, the human message is just like what it sounds like. It is the role of the person or

397
00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.340
Anthony Taylor: system asking a question.

398
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.120
Anthony Taylor: The AI message is the response

399
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:58.210
Anthony Taylor: to something. It doesn't necessarily have to be to a human message. But it is a response generated by the system.

400
00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:00.339
Anthony Taylor: A system message

401
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.110
Anthony Taylor: is basically an instruction.

402
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:15.400
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then there's a function message which is a chest chat message that's coming from a function call. Don't think we're going to get into that. But it is another type of role in Lane chain.

403
00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:21.530
Anthony Taylor: There you go that was exciting. So let's go and see what

404
00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:25.189
Anthony Taylor: this actually looks like in language.

405
00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:28.889
Anthony Taylor: The good news is, it's not too tough.

406
00:28:29.674 --> 00:28:34.510
Anthony Taylor: So you're gonna do the same loads we did yesterday. You're gonna get your model loaded and your key.

407
00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:38.390
Anthony Taylor: Everything will be great. So here we're just gonna do a basic

408
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:45.290
Anthony Taylor: like no shot type of item. So we're gonna have a human message and a system message.

409
00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.050
Anthony Taylor: And

410
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:51.620
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna initialize our Llm.

411
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:59.709
Anthony Taylor: Then we're going to create a list containing the system message and the human message. Now, system, message, I told you, is the instruction.

412
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:03.069
Anthony Taylor: So in this instruction we are saying.

413
00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:06.819
Anthony Taylor: you think carries away

414
00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:13.049
Anthony Taylor: is now okay in the system message we are saying, you're an athletic trainer.

415
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:18.200
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's not referring to you or me. That's the system.

416
00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:23.580
Anthony Taylor: The human message in this case provide me with a summary of what to do this week for my workouts.

417
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:29.800
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So this is actually pretty cool. We're assigning a role. And then we're asking it a question.

418
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:31.890
Anthony Taylor: and we will get an answer.

419
00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:35.379
Anthony Taylor: Cardiovascular April. Blah, blah, blah.

420
00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:40.050
Anthony Taylor: okay, all as if it was an athletic dream.

421
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.330
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

422
00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:57.080
Anthony Taylor: so that's pretty cool. And that's like the simplest form of you. Here's an instruction. And we're gonna remember in our chat bots, you know, with this question would be an input or something. Right?

423
00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:03.049
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So let's go down. Let's get a little more complex. So here we're actually going to create

424
00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:05.480
Anthony Taylor: prompt template.

425
00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:11.089
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we're gonna hack initialize our Llm.

426
00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:12.380
Anthony Taylor: And

427
00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:15.150
Anthony Taylor: we're going to define a format

428
00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.149
Anthony Taylor: for our template. Now.

429
00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:19.549
Anthony Taylor: really, when you look at this.

430
00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.390
Anthony Taylor: this is just a lot more

431
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:33.189
Anthony Taylor: definition as into what you are or who you are, or whatever is there a history tutor? Answer. Only now this is kind of fun. We could put restrictions in here.

432
00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:37.069
Anthony Taylor: answer only questions that would be covered in a history course.

433
00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:43.590
Anthony Taylor: If the human asks a question not related to history. Remind them that your job is to help them learn history

434
00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:53.259
Anthony Taylor: and ask them for a question on that topic. If they ask a question which there is not enough information to answer. Tell them you don't know, and don't make up an answer.

435
00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.329
Anthony Taylor: So this is our instruction.

436
00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:01.060
Anthony Taylor: The question will be a query.

437
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:10.210
Anthony Taylor: and that's our human one. And then the answer will be whatever it answers. So this is the format that we're going to tell our Llm. To use.

438
00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So our prompt template

439
00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:19.650
Anthony Taylor: input variables is the query, this right here.

440
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:23.619
Anthony Taylor: the template is this format?

441
00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:30.020
Anthony Taylor: Alright? So whatever question we ask will get plugged into this variable.

442
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:34.259
Anthony Taylor: Now, we just create a chain.

443
00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:41.589
Anthony Taylor: Llm use the prop template we just created. And now we can pass in a query. Now, because we told it.

444
00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:46.440
Anthony Taylor: We're going to pass in a query. Our question has to start with

445
00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.150
Anthony Taylor: the the keyword query.

446
00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:53.430
Anthony Taylor: alright. Why were the 1980 summer Olympics boycott?

447
00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.279
Anthony Taylor: That's our history question.

448
00:31:56.670 --> 00:32:03.809
Anthony Taylor: We're going to invoke and run it, and we're going to print out the result. Then we're going to say, Why is the sky blue?

449
00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:07.889
Anthony Taylor: Do we expect this model to answer that?

450
00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:12.700
Anthony Taylor: But let's find out.

451
00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:20.209
Anthony Taylor: So there you go. Some of the pictures are good primarily from Soviet Union's invasion of blah blah blah.

452
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:26.440
Anthony Taylor: Oh, I'm sorry. That question is not related to history. Do you have a question about historical event or time period?

453
00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:29.270
Anthony Taylor: Sky is blue, not history.

454
00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

455
00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:37.909
Anthony Taylor: so it properly responded. So think of this in a work setting.

456
00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:50.719
Anthony Taylor: If you guys are building a Chatbot for work, perhaps you don't want them asking what time the movies start, you know, down the street, or you don't want them to ask things that are outside a certain scope.

457
00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:52.739
Anthony Taylor: This would be a way you could do it.

458
00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:54.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

459
00:32:56.330 --> 00:33:01.109
Anthony Taylor: So now we're going to do a few shot prompt template. So give it a couple of answers.

460
00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:04.210
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to

461
00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.940
Anthony Taylor: go ahead. And

462
00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:09.550
Anthony Taylor: same thing as we force initialize our chat model.

463
00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:17.309
Anthony Taylor: And here's our prefix. So we're going to say, here are examples between a human and AI. The human provides work.

464
00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:24.430
Anthony Taylor: The AI provides a single sentence with easy to read words that mostly bribe with the word the human, provided

465
00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:28.859
Anthony Taylor: the sentence does not have to include the original word, for example.

466
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.830
Anthony Taylor: So that's our prefix

467
00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:34.720
Anthony Taylor: examples.

468
00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.070
Anthony Taylor: There's a list

469
00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:39.619
Anthony Taylor: we're got. Query, Brat answered. That's that next to bat.

470
00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:43.889
Anthony Taylor: And you can see there's 3 different examples.

471
00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:47.190
Anthony Taylor: Example.

472
00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.390
Anthony Taylor: format

473
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:53.069
Anthony Taylor: human asks a question. AI answers nothing special.

474
00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:57.850
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But note the keywords.

475
00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:05.040
Anthony Taylor: So prop template, we're going to input variables to our template? R query and answer.

476
00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:07.990
Anthony Taylor: okay.

477
00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:12.539
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to use the example format this one

478
00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:14.179
Anthony Taylor: as our template.

479
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:16.850
Anthony Taylor: Now, note.

480
00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:21.500
Anthony Taylor: there's no mention of this examples or prefix, yet is there?

481
00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:25.280
Anthony Taylor: We haven't even brought it up yet.

482
00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:29.360
Anthony Taylor: And then there's the suffix.

483
00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:35.600
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So our actual, prompt, template view shot, prompt template.

484
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:38.180
Anthony Taylor: We're going to pass in our examples.

485
00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:42.809
Anthony Taylor: We're going to pass in our example, template this guy here.

486
00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:45.670
Anthony Taylor: we're going to pass in our input variable.

487
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.639
Anthony Taylor: our prefix

488
00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:49.780
Anthony Taylor: this guy here

489
00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:52.419
Anthony Taylor: and our suffix.

490
00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:57.169
Anthony Taylor: And then we can do a separator between each example.

491
00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:01.610
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So we have all this stuff has to go in.

492
00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:03.490
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

493
00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:07.540
Anthony Taylor: And then we're just going to call our chain with our prompt template.

494
00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:12.119
Anthony Taylor: Give it a word. This is our query. So this is what's going to go here

495
00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:13.310
Anthony Taylor: and

496
00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:16.829
Anthony Taylor: ultimately there, and it'll be like that.

497
00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:20.589
Anthony Taylor: And then the result should come out as an answer.

498
00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:25.739
Anthony Taylor: Of a sentence that has words that rhyme with crop

499
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:27.740
Anthony Taylor: time to clean the grime off the line

500
00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.070
Anthony Taylor: kind of silly, but it works right.

501
00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.740
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So let's just quickly review.

502
00:35:37.064 --> 00:35:38.689
Clayton Graves: Word like orange in there.

503
00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.270
Clayton Graves: and it really messes.

504
00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:40.980
Anthony Taylor: Let's

505
00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:43.509
Anthony Taylor: let's do it, or did you already do it?

506
00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:45.179
Clayton Graves: I already did it.

507
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.059
Anthony Taylor: Well, now, everybody wants to see it.

508
00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:55.429
Anthony Taylor: Door hinge made a cringe in the orange that does end with the dinghy sound.

509
00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:57.640
Anthony Taylor: so.

510
00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.020
Raugewitz, Tania: I bet in my.

511
00:35:59.020 --> 00:35:59.370
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

512
00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:00.310
Raugewitz, Tania: Make it rhyme.

513
00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:02.809
Anthony Taylor: You are probably right.

514
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:03.959
Anthony Taylor: How about this?

515
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.070
Anthony Taylor: How do you spell it? Amen, ma'am?

516
00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.120
Anthony Taylor: Let's try it.

517
00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:19.800
Anthony Taylor: And same answer, dog gun.

518
00:36:21.173 --> 00:36:22.420
Anthony Taylor: anyway. Okay.

519
00:36:22.826 --> 00:36:33.739
Anthony Taylor: So the different things that we just covered we covered basically a simple shot or a one shot, not even a one shot simple request, but with an instruction.

520
00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:36.400
Anthony Taylor: The key here system messages

521
00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:38.069
Anthony Taylor: can have instruction.

522
00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.170
Anthony Taylor: Alright instructions

523
00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:43.360
Anthony Taylor: can change the tone

524
00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:45.280
Anthony Taylor: of your

525
00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.210
Anthony Taylor: take.

526
00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.850
Anthony Taylor: You want to give it personality

527
00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.520
Anthony Taylor: ready to go.

528
00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.620
Anthony Taylor: Dude.

529
00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.490
Anthony Taylor: Very simple.

530
00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:23.790
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

531
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:25.449
Anthony Taylor: he had a lot of fun.

532
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.949
Anthony Taylor: So every question is, if you're

533
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:30.130
Anthony Taylor: Arnold.

534
00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:35.300
Anthony Taylor: I don't know if I could spell this guy's name. Schwartz got it.

535
00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:38.790
Clayton Graves: I got it to I got it to do Marshall matters.

536
00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.090
Clayton Graves: so I see.

537
00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:40.680
Anthony Taylor: Go.

538
00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:50.560
Clayton Graves: I changed the prompt to you are famous, Rapper Marshall Mathers, and are going to answer in the style of rap, and then left in the initial instructions in there.

539
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:58.259
Clayton Graves: I changed the query to spaghetti, and there it is. Mom Spaghetti. Knee's weak arms are heavy.

540
00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:01.090
Raugewitz, Tania: Yes.

541
00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:01.430
Anthony Taylor: That's.

542
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.970
Raugewitz, Tania: Good job.

543
00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:03.220
Anthony Taylor: Haikuish.

544
00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:12.633
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So anyway, you could see you can have a lot of fun with instructions. You can have a lot of fun with all of these things right?

545
00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:26.319
Anthony Taylor: but the bottom line is is, we want to understand that instructions that changes our bot. We can give it more information and give it exactly what the question is going to look like.

546
00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:30.810
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And the answer, how we want the answer to be.

547
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:34.779
Anthony Taylor: which also allows us to put limitations and rules

548
00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:36.239
Anthony Taylor: on our bot.

549
00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:39.970
Anthony Taylor: We can give it examples of how we want it to answer.

550
00:38:40.937 --> 00:38:42.490
Anthony Taylor: yeah, yes, son.

551
00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:48.380
Baro, Sonja: So I noticed that the information that is

552
00:38:48.460 --> 00:39:01.019
Baro, Sonja: you use to give it context is called something different, depending on it looked like it was the different lane chain, whatever which one we were using. Cause you have format

553
00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:05.939
Baro, Sonja: and the first one or pre and then prefix. Yeah. So.

554
00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:07.470
Anthony Taylor: These are just variables, though.

555
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:10.039
Baro, Sonja: Okay, so we could call it anything. Okay?

556
00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:14.560
Anthony Taylor: You call about? Yeah, yeah. The idea is is, it goes into the template.

557
00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:20.729
Anthony Taylor: And I mean, I I don't know this for sure, but you probably could even like combine.

558
00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.349
Anthony Taylor: you know, I mean

559
00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:23.160
Anthony Taylor: oops.

560
00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:26.650
Anthony Taylor: But because all this really happening here

561
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:31.889
Anthony Taylor: is, it's going to just assemble the prefix, the example, the prompt and the suffer

562
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:33.190
Anthony Taylor: right.

563
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:34.070
Baro, Sonja: Right? Okay.

564
00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:38.570
Anthony Taylor: But not because it has. Maybe this. Maybe this one requires them all to be together.

565
00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:39.180
Baro, Sonja: Right.

566
00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:39.730
Anthony Taylor: But

567
00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:42.979
Anthony Taylor: yeah, something you could nicely look into if you would want to

568
00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:44.620
Anthony Taylor: thank you. It

569
00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:46.090
Anthony Taylor: pretty cool.

570
00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:48.240
Anthony Taylor: right pretty cool.

571
00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:51.850
Anthony Taylor: and the slime a mind danced in time.

572
00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:55.850
Anthony Taylor: all whatever.

573
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:59.190
Anthony Taylor: Okay, was it really orange sheriff? Or that's I didn't.

574
00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:00.600
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

575
00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.130
Anthony Taylor: alright.

576
00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:06.509
Anthony Taylor: So now it's your turn. Go into lane chain

577
00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.920
Anthony Taylor: and create some stuff.

578
00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:11.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, this one.

579
00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.250
Anthony Taylor: hopefully, they gave you a lot of stuff here.

580
00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:23.910
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So this was, gonna take you a few minutes because you're gonna have to type some quotes.

581
00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:27.040
Anthony Taylor: you're gonna have to have some fun with this.

582
00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:31.290
Anthony Taylor: Oh, yeah.

583
00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:36.880
Anthony Taylor: doesn't make a ton of sense.

584
00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:39.949
Anthony Taylor: So yeah, so you have 20 min to do this one

585
00:40:40.535 --> 00:40:44.360
Anthony Taylor: and your goal is to create a quote generator.

586
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:46.420
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

587
00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:47.580
Anthony Taylor: that's it.

588
00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:49.990
Anthony Taylor: Be creative. Have fun with it

589
00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.909
Anthony Taylor: to get done early, be more creative, and have more funds.

590
00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:56.220
Anthony Taylor: Aye.

591
00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:58.019
Masarirambi, Rodney: We definitely do.

592
00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:02.150
Clayton Graves: Interesting things to say about flatulence, and Donald Trump.

593
00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:05.430
Anthony Taylor: Really did you say, Yoda.

594
00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.749
Anthony Taylor: is that what I heard you say.

595
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:12.850
Dipinto, Matt: Yeah, that we we

596
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:13.960
Dipinto, Matt: made a

597
00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:17.379
Dipinto, Matt: a quote generator and the voice of Yoda.

598
00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:20.280
Anthony Taylor: I love that

599
00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:22.380
Anthony Taylor: that's so freaking awesome.

600
00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:23.520
Anthony Taylor: I

601
00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:29.079
Anthony Taylor: I will ask for some like, where'd you guys do? But first let's go through

602
00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:31.149
Anthony Taylor: the official answer.

603
00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:32.119
Baro, Sonja: That's good. Yeah.

604
00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:32.679
Anthony Taylor: So the.

605
00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.960
Baro, Sonja: Get a show and tell cause that sounds really.

606
00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:40.219
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I would love to see that. Let me just quickly go through the official answer. So you all have it.

607
00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:44.059
Anthony Taylor: Case there was any issues. So the first 2 same results.

608
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:50.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're going to do few shot on this one. That was one of the things you were supposed to decide. Did everybody do few shot?

609
00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:54.410
Anthony Taylor: Or do you guys just do instruction and question.

610
00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:57.980
Dipinto, Matt: Provided us few shots off the bat.

611
00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:00.439
Anthony Taylor: Oh, did they? Okay, well, that's nice stuff.

612
00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:09.620
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So we initialize our model. Here's our examples topic, imagination, topic love. And then you just put in a quote.

613
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:11.719
Anthony Taylor: did you guys do examples like this?

614
00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:14.740
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

615
00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.870
Anthony Taylor: where'd you guys did it give them to you?

616
00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:20.239
Anthony Taylor: No, it did. Where'd you guys get the quotes.

617
00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.799
Clayton Graves: We went on Googled. Yoda quotes.

618
00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:26.650
Anthony Taylor: Oh, I like that. That's smart.

619
00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:27.410
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

620
00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:27.800
Masarirambi, Rodney: Yeah, well.

621
00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:30.240
Anthony Taylor: And then you have your sample. Oh, sorry question.

622
00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:32.760
Anthony Taylor: No.

623
00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:37.769
Anthony Taylor: Your example. Format is just like the one we had before. We're just going back and forth.

624
00:42:38.413 --> 00:42:44.479
Anthony Taylor: Your template, so that you got to pass in a topic. And the AI is going to provide a quote

625
00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:45.900
Anthony Taylor: topic

626
00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:47.230
Anthony Taylor: quote.

627
00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:51.279
Anthony Taylor: and then the example format we had up above.

628
00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:59.390
Anthony Taylor: Prefects generate quotes, topic mentioned by the human try to match style. Examples given below, so

629
00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:01.150
Anthony Taylor: could do that

630
00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:09.349
Anthony Taylor: possibly could have put like the same quotes like this, and said, answer in the voice of Yoda, that might have worked.

631
00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:15.090
Anthony Taylor: And then

632
00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:24.480
Anthony Taylor: we're going to fill in all of the things, and then we just do the thing. Examples, example, template queries prefix, suffix.

633
00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:25.730
Anthony Taylor: etc.

634
00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.060
Anthony Taylor: Run our chain.

635
00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:30.370
Anthony Taylor: What topic do you want to create

636
00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:33.480
Anthony Taylor: L. Ellip

637
00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:36.840
Anthony Taylor: and

638
00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:38.720
Anthony Taylor: get our response.

639
00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:55.919
Anthony Taylor: So what's fun? I really love the verbose on these things right? So trying to match the style, and then it gives all the stuff. And then lawyers, like all artists, are in the business of creating their medium as language. That's funny. Llm. Came up with a lawyer quote.

640
00:43:56.950 --> 00:44:00.579
Anthony Taylor: Okay, before I give it over to see some of the examples. Let's just try something.

641
00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:31.960
Anthony Taylor: Maybe

642
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:37.430
Anthony Taylor: the heart of a dog. Loyalty and love reside a true friend, they are always by your side.

643
00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:40.669
Anthony Taylor: How could you go if that was Yoda's voice? Maybe.

644
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:41.100
Clayton Graves: Yeah.

645
00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:41.780
Anthony Taylor: And know.

646
00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:43.259
Clayton Graves: No, no, no, no!

647
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:44.920
Clayton Graves: Here it is!

648
00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:49.779
Anthony Taylor: Before we do show Intel, though. Hold on quick. Does anybody have any questions about how we did?

649
00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:52.719
Anthony Taylor: Pretty straightforward? Yeah.

650
00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:53.570
Anthony Taylor: my.

651
00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:56.910
Baro, Sonja: Question is, where did you put the verbose

652
00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:00.050
Baro, Sonja: parameter in there?

653
00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:01.350
Baro, Sonja: There it is.

654
00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:05.536
Baro, Sonja: Chain. Okay, I found it. I see it. Okay. Thank you.

655
00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:07.850
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

656
00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:12.140
Anthony Taylor: Who wants to show what they did? I I surely want to see the Yoda one.

657
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:15.520
Masarirambi, Rodney: I think everybody wants to show.

658
00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:18.879
Clayton Graves: I did one on flatulence

659
00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:22.780
Clayton Graves: voiced by Yota

660
00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:28.960
Clayton Graves: flatulence, a natural body function. It is embarrass. You should not be.

661
00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:30.769
Clayton Graves: Control your emotions.

662
00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:36.109
Clayton Graves: You went.

663
00:45:36.110 --> 00:45:36.910
Mason, Natalie: Silent.

664
00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:38.989
Clayton Graves: Yeah, that sucked

665
00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:39.835
Clayton Graves: so

666
00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:46.729
Clayton Graves: embarrassed you should not be. Control your emotions, control your gas. You must hmm.

667
00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:52.230
Anthony Taylor: All right.

668
00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:00.410
Anthony Taylor: Anybody else.

669
00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:02.319
Derek Rikke: That was it.

670
00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:04.990
Anthony Taylor: That was the only one. Go, Derek, what did you do?

671
00:46:06.625 --> 00:46:09.080
Derek Rikke: We're gonna show you I'm not gonna read it

672
00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:12.589
Derek Rikke: alright. What topic would you like to learn about?

673
00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:19.350
Anthony Taylor: Oh, he did! Samuel Jackson.

674
00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:21.600
Derek Rikke: What's a good topic.

675
00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:22.630
Anthony Taylor: Big Max.

676
00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:24.970
Derek Rikke: Name Max.

677
00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:25.840
Clayton Graves: Makes.

678
00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:29.732
Baro, Sonja: That's good. I think it's the Cheeseburger, isn't it? Or no, he likes the big.

679
00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:31.660
Derek Rikke: Cheeseburger.

680
00:46:32.045 --> 00:46:32.430
Clayton Graves: Reverting.

681
00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:33.080
Anthony Taylor: To Steve. Well.

682
00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:36.189
michael mcpherson: Hmm! That is a tasty burger.

683
00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:38.000
Derek Rikke: There you go!

684
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.983
Baro, Sonja: I don't remember. I love that. It's in all caps.

685
00:46:43.113 --> 00:46:43.780
Curry Gardner: One again.

686
00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:47.709
Anthony Taylor: That's pretty good.

687
00:46:49.150 --> 00:47:06.359
Anthony Taylor: Alright! Well, that's fun. So it's fun. I mean, imagine. I mean, just obviously a business garbage couldn't get this crazy. But it could be fun to, you know. Give people the option to to play with voices and stuff like that in your bot, and now you know how to do it. You can make it a variable

688
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:10.560
Anthony Taylor: that they passed in, or that they select, and you could have a little bit of fun with it.

689
00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:15.269
Anthony Taylor: So, anyway, any questions about any of that.

690
00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:20.760
Masarirambi, Rodney: The key is very obscure. Easter eggs to get those quotes in

691
00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:23.569
Masarirambi, Rodney: very obscure Easter eggs.

692
00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:26.989
Anthony Taylor: That would be fun. It would be fun.

693
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:32.399
Anthony Taylor: Alright, alright. So after break we're gonna talk about

694
00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:40.489
Anthony Taylor: output parsers, and you're gonna find that while that doesn't sound very exciting, is it actually super important?

695
00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:41.800
Anthony Taylor: So

696
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:48.230
Anthony Taylor: I will see you in 15 min. It's yeah. Just come back a quarter after

697
00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:49.900
Anthony Taylor: you get 20 min.

698
00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:52.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I'll see you then.

699
00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:56.520
Anthony Taylor: Alright, Gary.

700
00:47:58.530 --> 00:48:03.220
Anthony Taylor: cool, we're that that that was a pretty exciting

701
00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:06.030
Anthony Taylor: exercise. I got a lot of people

702
00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.210
Anthony Taylor: came up with some cool stuff.

703
00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:12.600
Anthony Taylor: just a heads up. My

704
00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:15.539
Anthony Taylor: production issue is mostly resolved.

705
00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:19.689
Anthony Taylor: So I am much less stressed. I know you guys could tell, I was stressed.

706
00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:27.710
Anthony Taylor: No, that's okay, was very stressful for a few moments, because, like

707
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:30.390
Anthony Taylor: people all over the country were complaining.

708
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:32.830
Anthony Taylor: But it's back up and running.

709
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:34.920
Anthony Taylor: So

710
00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:38.529
Anthony Taylor: enough of it's back up and running that nobody's complete.

711
00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:42.780
Anthony Taylor: hi!

712
00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:46.400
Anthony Taylor: So the next thing we're gonna talk about output parsers.

713
00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:51.559
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so you're like, wait like that. What an output, parser! Well.

714
00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:54.319
Anthony Taylor: keeping in mind

715
00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:56.530
Anthony Taylor: that

716
00:48:57.690 --> 00:49:02.359
Anthony Taylor: not everything we could do with an Llm. Needs to be a chat. Bot.

717
00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:10.170
Anthony Taylor: Okay, like, I was talking at the beginning of class, we could just be using an Llm within an application

718
00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:12.180
Anthony Taylor: to do something.

719
00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:23.229
Anthony Taylor: We pass it data. We have a decent step, and it returns an output that we then either return to our application or do some other activity with

720
00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:24.430
Anthony Taylor: so

721
00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:31.389
Anthony Taylor: a lot of times the stuff that comes back from our models are just free text.

722
00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:36.179
Anthony Taylor: It's really no anything to it. So wouldn't it be nice

723
00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:41.599
Anthony Taylor: if we had ways to parse that output into maybe a list

724
00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:45.019
Anthony Taylor: or appendous data frame.

725
00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:49.560
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Or Json

726
00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:52.340
Anthony Taylor: could be almost anything.

727
00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:56.790
Anthony Taylor: So Lane chain output parsers are meant for exactly

728
00:49:57.090 --> 00:49:58.100
Anthony Taylor: that.

729
00:49:58.736 --> 00:50:00.619
Anthony Taylor: There's a lot of them.

730
00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:06.239
Anthony Taylor: you can see the 3. We're going to look at. Comma separated list

731
00:50:07.773 --> 00:50:09.280
Anthony Taylor: structured output

732
00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:11.270
Anthony Taylor: and pidantic.

733
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:12.969
Anthony Taylor: Then the

734
00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:14.859
Anthony Taylor: did. It didn't.

735
00:50:16.310 --> 00:50:20.079
Anthony Taylor: So those are the those are the ones we're gonna look at today.

736
00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:27.420
Anthony Taylor: And that's the only slide for this this right here. So let's go take a look.

737
00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:31.530
Anthony Taylor: just gonna close it

738
00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:33.230
Anthony Taylor: closer.

739
00:50:39.610 --> 00:50:44.984
Anthony Taylor: Oh, I think there is a bug in one of these talk. Got it? I probably just messed up. Oh, well,

740
00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:53.680
Anthony Taylor: Because when I go through everything I fix all the bugs so that you guys don't get to watch me find bugs. That's always fun.

741
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:56.190
Anthony Taylor: But

742
00:50:58.020 --> 00:50:58.760
Anthony Taylor: we'll get

743
00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:00.330
Anthony Taylor: just the same.

744
00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:05.470
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna start same way, load our stuff, get it going.

745
00:51:05.968 --> 00:51:11.649
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna add output parsers. We're gonna start with a comma separated list output. Parser.

746
00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:17.179
Anthony Taylor: we're just gonna do a normal question. Nothing. Fancy. Okay. But

747
00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:19.730
Anthony Taylor: you do need to remember

748
00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:21.962
Anthony Taylor: that you will

749
00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:28.400
Anthony Taylor: need to do this, get format instructions.

750
00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:34.570
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So what happens is you create this model. Look at point 9

751
00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:38.540
Anthony Taylor: and we do parser equals. And we pass in

752
00:51:38.590 --> 00:51:39.710
Anthony Taylor: this parser.

753
00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:41.640
Anthony Taylor: Then

754
00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:43.920
Anthony Taylor: for instructions.

755
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:48.019
Anthony Taylor: we say, parser dot get format instructions.

756
00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.879
Anthony Taylor: and then we're going to print them out.

757
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:57.779
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so let's actually break this right here and let me show you what that looks like.

758
00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.399
Anthony Taylor: So there's

759
00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:00.840
Anthony Taylor: the instruction.

760
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:04.201
Anthony Taylor: So while this seems all like.

761
00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:07.360
Anthony Taylor: it's just simple instruction

762
00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:11.370
Anthony Taylor: that it's gonna add to your mall, to your your.

763
00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:13.130
Anthony Taylor: your your Llm. Call

764
00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:16.360
Anthony Taylor: you could then this your sense?

765
00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:17.680
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

766
00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:22.739
Anthony Taylor: So here we're gonna say, query, list, recap reviews, and then

767
00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:26.890
Anthony Taylor: 2 returns and and and and then the instructions.

768
00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:31.320
Anthony Taylor: So it's basically gonna append this to your query.

769
00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:34.870
Anthony Taylor: Invoke the query, print the results.

770
00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:37.920
Anthony Taylor: And then

771
00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:43.679
Anthony Taylor: we're going to parser dot parce the content.

772
00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:47.269
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we'll see the result, and then we'll see it part.

773
00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:52.000
Anthony Taylor: So notice it gave it to us in comma delimited format

774
00:52:52.450 --> 00:52:54.480
Anthony Taylor: of which our parser

775
00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:56.180
Anthony Taylor: turned it into a list.

776
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:58.050
Anthony Taylor: Make sense.

777
00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:03.439
Anthony Taylor: This could be very helpful, right? If you need a list of something

778
00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:06.650
Anthony Taylor: that you're going to loop through and do something

779
00:53:07.170 --> 00:53:09.280
Anthony Taylor: right. Maybe this is the way you go.

780
00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:13.169
Anthony Taylor: So there's a lot of options here.

781
00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:15.770
Anthony Taylor: Everybody pretty good with that.

782
00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:17.660
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

783
00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:21.070
Anthony Taylor: a structured parser.

784
00:53:21.790 --> 00:53:22.840
Anthony Taylor: K,

785
00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:25.740
Anthony Taylor: so with a structured parser

786
00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:31.469
Anthony Taylor: and then

787
00:53:35.350 --> 00:53:38.989
Anthony Taylor: multiple, this, this allows you to get multiple kinds

788
00:53:39.010 --> 00:53:43.910
Anthony Taylor: of output. So let's just go through it here. So here we have

789
00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.979
Anthony Taylor: a schema

790
00:53:46.070 --> 00:53:52.120
Anthony Taylor: that we're going to give it. So this allows us to do. I believe this is the one that does a dictionary return

791
00:53:52.620 --> 00:54:01.140
Anthony Taylor: explain? Allows us to more complex. Yeah. So this will return a dictionary. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna give it a schema. This email is

792
00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:03.649
Anthony Taylor: the name of

793
00:54:03.690 --> 00:54:08.479
Anthony Taylor: something that the model is gonna return. And then it will build the description.

794
00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:10.800
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

795
00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:18.099
Anthony Taylor: So again, we give it the schema. We say, pars, response schemas, and then pass that in.

796
00:54:18.370 --> 00:54:21.260
Anthony Taylor: Then we can. Here, let's look at the instructions again.

797
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:33.300
Anthony Taylor: These will be a little more elaborate. The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema include the leading and trailing Json

798
00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:36.500
Anthony Taylor: objects, okay? So

799
00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:39.020
Anthony Taylor: the model is going to return

800
00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:40.200
Anthony Taylor: this.

801
00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:43.850
Anthony Taylor: He.

802
00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:50.999
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna say, query or name a country and its capital. There's the instructions.

803
00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:58.010
Anthony Taylor: Invoke. Print the results, and then we're going to let the parser run. Parser is the structured one.

804
00:54:58.110 --> 00:55:01.330
Anthony Taylor: Print that out. And then we could print each key out, separate.

805
00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:03.360
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

806
00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:09.930
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna split it right there. So you guys can see that one.

807
00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:14.559
Anthony Taylor: So you can see it, returned Germany, Berlin.

808
00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:17.550
Anthony Taylor: Then the that was the first print.

809
00:55:18.328 --> 00:55:24.309
Anthony Taylor: Then this next one is the actual parsed data. So it created a dictionary object.

810
00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:27.559
Anthony Taylor: And then we said, Show us the country. Show us the cap.

811
00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:28.760
Anthony Taylor: terminate for that

812
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:30.550
Anthony Taylor: tab.

813
00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:36.320
Anthony Taylor: Now we're gonna go. Something different. We're actually gonna take the output

814
00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:38.559
Anthony Taylor: of this

815
00:55:38.810 --> 00:55:42.040
Anthony Taylor: and invoke the query again

816
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:45.040
Anthony Taylor: and print and print the results.

817
00:55:48.350 --> 00:55:49.680
Anthony Taylor: Interesting? Huh?

818
00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:56.720
Anthony Taylor: Why didn't it return as addiction.

819
00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:04.319
Dipinto, Matt: Does. The instructions weren't appended to that.

820
00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:12.660
Anthony Taylor: Absolutely right. So up here, when we created the query, we appended the instructions from the parser.

821
00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:15.220
Anthony Taylor: So it knew to do that.

822
00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:18.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and new to do this.

823
00:56:19.647 --> 00:56:22.150
Anthony Taylor: Here we just created a new question

824
00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:25.990
Anthony Taylor: and invoked, and we got an answer.

825
00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:28.660
Anthony Taylor: That's pretty cool, right?

826
00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:32.159
Anthony Taylor: See how we can kind of build like an application. Now.

827
00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:34.140
Anthony Taylor: using the utilizing these.

828
00:56:34.992 --> 00:56:39.200
Anthony Taylor: The next one we're gonna look at is the pedantic one.

829
00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:48.310
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Now in the let's just go through. So here we have a field, we have a base model. We have a couple of things that we're looking at.

830
00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:51.529
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so for this one. We're gonna say.

831
00:56:53.330 --> 00:56:55.100
Anthony Taylor: we're going to create a class

832
00:56:57.110 --> 00:56:58.270
Anthony Taylor: on country.

833
00:56:58.290 --> 00:57:02.780
Anthony Taylor: It's gonna have a name which is a string. And this is the

834
00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:04.319
Anthony Taylor: the description.

835
00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:09.160
Anthony Taylor: a capital which is also a strain. This is the description.

836
00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:13.140
Anthony Taylor: a population which is an int. And this is the description.

837
00:57:14.590 --> 00:57:15.400
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

838
00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:20.449
Anthony Taylor: gonna pass that in that class into

839
00:57:20.810 --> 00:57:22.400
Anthony Taylor: are parser.

840
00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:30.480
Anthony Taylor: Create the instructions. Let's split this right here, so we can see the instructions. It will create instructions based on

841
00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:33.390
Anthony Taylor: the class. So now notice. It says

842
00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:37.980
Anthony Taylor: it's got all this fun stuff in there. It's just basically showing

843
00:57:38.948 --> 00:57:40.540
Anthony Taylor: how it should look.

844
00:57:41.290 --> 00:57:44.210
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And then here's the actual schema

845
00:57:44.250 --> 00:57:45.840
Anthony Taylor: that it wants to out

846
00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:48.890
Anthony Taylor: quite a bit. Actually.

847
00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:50.680
Anthony Taylor: alright.

848
00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:59.899
Anthony Taylor: So here we can say, name any country, its capital, and its population. Now, do know, you have to actually ask for this stuff.

849
00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:03.399
Anthony Taylor: You couldn't just go name country, and it'll fill all that in.

850
00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:11.509
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you have to actively request it, and the instructions invoke the query, print it all out.

851
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:13.250
Anthony Taylor: We'll stop here

852
00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:22.099
Anthony Taylor: and you can see it created this dictionary object

853
00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:23.480
Anthony Taylor: and

854
00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:25.670
Anthony Taylor: outputted.

855
00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:29.089
Anthony Taylor: So the result was this dictionary object.

856
00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:30.910
Anthony Taylor: and then the parser

857
00:58:31.290 --> 00:58:34.450
Anthony Taylor: turned it into this. And then we could call

858
00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:38.460
Anthony Taylor: data data.name data, capital data, dot population.

859
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:42.790
Anthony Taylor: Me, personally, I like the structured one better. It's way easier.

860
00:58:43.570 --> 00:58:49.310
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And the the the thing that they get all excited about is that you make this an Int

861
00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:52.780
Anthony Taylor: or whatever data type, and it'll come back as that.

862
00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:55.870
Anthony Taylor: I mean, this is a dictionary object. We just would

863
00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:58.609
Anthony Taylor: work with it that way. But

864
00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:02.179
Anthony Taylor: you might have a situation where this comes in. Now you know how to do it.

865
00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:03.920
Anthony Taylor: And again.

866
00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:07.280
Anthony Taylor: we wanted to see 3 attachments for one of the

867
00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:09.879
Anthony Taylor: properties of our class

868
00:59:09.890 --> 00:59:12.060
Anthony Taylor: data dot capital invoke.

869
00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:13.490
Anthony Taylor: and we get our prop.

870
00:59:16.450 --> 00:59:17.340
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

871
00:59:18.290 --> 00:59:19.269
Anthony Taylor: pretty cool.

872
00:59:20.650 --> 00:59:26.689
Anthony Taylor: So the main thing I want you to take away from this is the value of the parser.

873
00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:29.320
Anthony Taylor: I know we haven't been thinking.

874
00:59:29.410 --> 00:59:32.569
Anthony Taylor: And I'm hoping today I'm gonna steer you that direction

875
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:36.780
Anthony Taylor: that anything other than Chatbot with all these Llms.

876
00:59:37.050 --> 00:59:40.480
Anthony Taylor: But these things can do some amazing stuff

877
00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:48.189
Anthony Taylor: I think of. I don't know how many of you guys are using this like daily, but one of my favorite things to do.

878
00:59:48.530 --> 00:59:50.719
Anthony Taylor: And and and it comes up a lot

879
00:59:50.790 --> 00:59:53.519
Anthony Taylor: right is I'll have like

880
00:59:55.110 --> 00:59:55.980
Anthony Taylor: I mean.

881
00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:57.120
Anthony Taylor: a table

882
00:59:57.470 --> 01:00:02.040
Anthony Taylor: right? I have a table. I don't even have to show it. I have a table. It has

883
01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.330
Anthony Taylor: 198 columns in.

884
01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:08.930
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this happens all the freaking time.

885
01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:14.789
Anthony Taylor: And I need query the table. But I need to query the columns no select star.

886
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:19.540
Anthony Taylor: I need to query the individual columns. Now. I can write a cool little python script

887
01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:23.060
Anthony Taylor: loops through and does it. That's a lot of work I can take.

888
01:00:24.090 --> 01:00:27.870
Anthony Taylor: Just I can do. Describe table. It gives me the column names.

889
01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:30.950
Anthony Taylor: Put those into an Lm. And say, write me a selection

890
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:32.670
Anthony Taylor: instantly. Done

891
01:00:33.570 --> 01:00:34.530
Anthony Taylor: instant.

892
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:37.029
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and I'm done

893
01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:41.340
Anthony Taylor: now. Didn't require me to have a chat bot for that.

894
01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:45.990
Anthony Taylor: I just needed to input that information. Well, I could write it out

895
01:00:46.590 --> 01:00:48.360
Anthony Taylor: using an Llm.

896
01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.880
Anthony Taylor: Right, and say.

897
01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:54.879
Anthony Taylor: pass in a table and boop! It just spits spits out

898
01:00:55.210 --> 01:01:07.989
Anthony Taylor: that sequel all one app again. This isn't hard to do in Python, either, but the point is is that this is a use for Llms that I'm using all the time that I could create an app from that is not a chat.

899
01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:12.719
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So that's the point of the parsers.

900
01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:15.819
Anthony Taylor: They give us the ability to use the

901
01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:18.760
Anthony Taylor: plus. They give us the ability to let LOM.

902
01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:25.079
Anthony Taylor: Provide like in these cases. Hey, what's this country's population?

903
01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:28.190
Anthony Taylor: Give us some information for the answer

904
01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:31.040
Anthony Taylor: from the last response.

905
01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:33.220
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

906
01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:35.950
Anthony Taylor: kind of fun stuff

907
01:01:36.850 --> 01:01:38.010
Anthony Taylor: any questions

908
01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:40.620
Anthony Taylor: that bore you out of death without the parsers?

909
01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:44.440
Anthony Taylor: I'm much more excited about it than you guys are, I can tell.

910
01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:46.439
Anthony Taylor: But that's okay.

911
01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:51.230
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So what are you gonna do in this next one? So in this next one

912
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:53.860
Anthony Taylor: you're going to.

913
01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:57.260
Anthony Taylor: I think you're just gonna create a thing to do recipes.

914
01:01:57.690 --> 01:01:58.400
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

915
01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:06.519
Anthony Taylor: So in this activity, you go look over, run the first block. Blah, blah, blah initialize

916
01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:12.820
Anthony Taylor: recipe suggestion program allows users to get more information about dishes they're interested in.

917
01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:16.639
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So I believe what they want you to do

918
01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:19.239
Anthony Taylor: is it's gonna output

919
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:27.660
Anthony Taylor: like these 3 things, and then you're gonna ask them to give it their type, the number. And then you're gonna provide a recipe based on

920
01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:29.070
Anthony Taylor: that numbers

921
01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.100
Anthony Taylor: recipe.

922
01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:31.920
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

923
01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:33.420
Anthony Taylor: Fun time.

924
01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:35.879
Anthony Taylor: Awesome for this one.

925
01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:44.210
Anthony Taylor: And sec.

926
01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:56.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay, for this one you got 15

927
01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:00.720
Anthony Taylor: should be enough. That's so funny.

928
01:03:01.070 --> 01:03:01.960
Anthony Taylor: So

929
01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.799
Anthony Taylor: how'd you do with the recipe dude thing.

930
01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:10.990
Anthony Taylor: no issues. Still.

931
01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:16.520
Anthony Taylor: are we just getting so good at this that we, you know, we just have no more issues.

932
01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:21.099
Meredith McCanse (she/her): We got stuck at this step where we had to.

933
01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:23.089
Meredith McCanse (she/her): where we were trying to be able to

934
01:03:23.170 --> 01:03:24.380
Meredith McCanse (she/her): call like.

935
01:03:24.690 --> 01:03:30.579
Meredith McCanse (she/her): put in a number, and then have it spit back the number of the recipe we were a little stuck with, how to set that up.

936
01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:31.809
Anthony Taylor: You're gonna be like

937
01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:33.430
Anthony Taylor: Duh

938
01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:34.720
Anthony Taylor: whenever I show it to you.

939
01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:35.970
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

940
01:03:36.130 --> 01:03:37.310
Anthony Taylor: so let me show

941
01:03:37.410 --> 01:03:39.160
Anthony Taylor: so

942
01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:42.380
Anthony Taylor: well, good, and we'll have a couple people go

943
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:44.470
Anthony Taylor: alright.

944
01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:47.479
Anthony Taylor: So we do our normal loads. Nothing new.

945
01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:51.719
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we are going to use a comma separated list output, parser.

946
01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:55.389
Anthony Taylor: Right? So before I go. One step further.

947
01:03:57.650 --> 01:03:59.570
Anthony Taylor: How do you pick an item out of a list.

948
01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:03.500
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Use the index.

949
01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:08.250
Anthony Taylor: Right, but you gave the numbers 1, 2, and 3. So how would you

950
01:04:08.590 --> 01:04:10.319
Anthony Taylor: select the correct number.

951
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:11.540
Baro, Sonja: Right.

952
01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:12.560
Meredith McCanse (she/her): The minus one.

953
01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.560
Sihong Zhou: Your minus, one.

954
01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:16.089
Anthony Taylor: 4 0 plus one, the index plus one.

955
01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:17.050
Meredith McCanse (she/her): You know.

956
01:04:17.050 --> 01:04:18.950
Anthony Taylor: Does that? Does that tell you? Now you're like.

957
01:04:19.870 --> 01:04:22.465
Meredith McCanse (she/her): No, I tried that, but I tried that.

958
01:04:22.790 --> 01:04:23.370
Baro, Sonja: That.

959
01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:25.969
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I did something wrong, so I couldn't get it to work.

960
01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:26.530
Anthony Taylor: Oh!

961
01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:30.129
Dipinto, Matt: Giving you the invalid string and integer.

962
01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:30.740
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yep.

963
01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:31.179
Dipinto, Matt: Speak at us.

964
01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:32.390
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yeah, yeah.

965
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:36.810
Dipinto, Matt: Input because anything that comes through an input is always a string.

966
01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:37.550
Sihong Zhou: Yeah.

967
01:04:37.550 --> 01:04:39.799
Anthony Taylor: Everything comes back from the Ll. Will be a string.

968
01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:46.690
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yeah, I told it to be an integer. I think that the string I ended up with actually only had one item on it. It didn't have. It wasn't.

969
01:04:46.690 --> 01:04:47.620
Anthony Taylor: Oh!

970
01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:53.040
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So that I think that's where I had a problem, and I don't know how to not do that. Not do that.

971
01:04:54.191 --> 01:04:56.300
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Oh, see? Yeah, I don't know.

972
01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:57.930
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So here's our parser.

973
01:04:58.190 --> 01:05:03.520
Anthony Taylor: Right? It's gonna create our instructions just like before. It's always the same instructions.

974
01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:09.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're gonna say, please give me the names of 3 different dinner options, using a variety of main ingredients

975
01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:11.469
Anthony Taylor: at the instructions.

976
01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:13.580
Anthony Taylor: Boo!

977
01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:17.189
Anthony Taylor: Now we can invoke our query.

978
01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:21.399
Anthony Taylor: We'll get a result, we'll parse our results.

979
01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:25.029
Anthony Taylor: And then we're gonna loop through

980
01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:26.770
Anthony Taylor: our data

981
01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:29.019
Anthony Taylor: and print out

982
01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:30.830
Anthony Taylor: each item.

983
01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:32.460
Baro, Sonja: That's what it was.

984
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:35.560
Anthony Taylor: I think it's funny that it's 1 one. But that's okay.

985
01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:45.480
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And then, now we're gonna say, please enter the number next to the dish. You would like recipe for recalling that, we added one.

986
01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:48.110
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so if we run this.

987
01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:49.020
Anthony Taylor: One.

988
01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:50.050
Baro, Sonja: Breathe.

989
01:05:50.050 --> 01:05:51.609
Anthony Taylor: I like.

990
01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:52.540
Baro, Sonja: Data.

991
01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:53.090
Anthony Taylor: E.

992
01:05:55.850 --> 01:05:58.890
Anthony Taylor: And now we're gonna get data.

993
01:05:58.890 --> 01:06:01.299
Baro, Sonja: Hold on! Hold on! Slow down! Slow down! Wait!

994
01:06:02.535 --> 01:06:03.010
Anthony Taylor: Pause.

995
01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:07.340
Baro, Sonja: String.

996
01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:10.140
Baro, Sonja: Shoot

997
01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:14.490
Baro, Sonja: string.

998
01:06:15.490 --> 01:06:16.720
Baro, Sonja: I

999
01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:20.050
Baro, Sonja: plus one

1000
01:06:22.410 --> 01:06:23.360
Baro, Sonja: plus

1001
01:06:30.010 --> 01:06:30.960
Baro, Sonja: plus

1002
01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:33.500
Baro, Sonja: data.

1003
01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:36.650
Baro, Sonja: I

1004
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:38.270
Baro, Sonja: close the list.

1005
01:06:42.030 --> 01:06:44.649
Anthony Taylor: We good? What are you missing right here?

1006
01:06:44.910 --> 01:06:47.119
Anthony Taylor: I could have just pasted this to you.

1007
01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:50.140
Anthony Taylor: I don't mind.

1008
01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:51.189
Baro, Sonja: No, I got it.

1009
01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:53.519
Anthony Taylor: Oh, okay, alright.

1010
01:06:53.720 --> 01:07:02.680
Anthony Taylor: So you got that? I gave you the list. Then we're going to select one of the items, remembering we added one when we presented it, we have to subtract one with from the

1011
01:07:02.970 --> 01:07:04.030
Anthony Taylor: the item.

1012
01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.440
Anthony Taylor: There's that index error.

1013
01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:16.219
Anthony Taylor: Hmm! What could that be?

1014
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:23.979
Anthony Taylor: Why is it not printing. How about print? Num.

1015
01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:39.490
Anthony Taylor: One.

1016
01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:41.730
Anthony Taylor: Now minus one

1017
01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:48.670
Anthony Taylor: query. Please give me a full recipe for the name, including ingredients and steps. So now we're passing in

1018
01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.500
Anthony Taylor: this name.

1019
01:07:52.850 --> 01:07:54.320
Anthony Taylor: and we get

1020
01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:56.799
Anthony Taylor: to run our query and see the content.

1021
01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.489
Raugewitz, Tania: I got stuck at the

1022
01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:03.780
Raugewitz, Tania: the get the matching recipe name. Your name equals data recipe.

1023
01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:05.490
Raugewitz, Tania: I have this part.

1024
01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.160
Anthony Taylor: Or this part.

1025
01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:09.979
Raugewitz, Tania: No no no down below, further down.

1026
01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:11.280
Anthony Taylor: Oh! This one!

1027
01:08:12.063 --> 01:08:17.640
Raugewitz, Tania: No, no, don't. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Get the matching recipe name name equals 16 where it says 16

1028
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:20.648
Raugewitz, Tania: name equals data bracket. Now minus one.

1029
01:08:22.142 --> 01:08:24.889
Raugewitz, Tania: You you had an error, and then.

1030
01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:27.239
Anthony Taylor: I did, I put in 3

1031
01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:31.400
Anthony Taylor: which you would think would work. Let's see why, let's see if that didn't work.

1032
01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:33.649
Anthony Taylor: or why that didn't work.

1033
01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:35.129
Raugewitz, Tania: Why it works.

1034
01:08:35.130 --> 01:08:37.519
Anthony Taylor: So it says, 3

1035
01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:40.639
Anthony Taylor: name equals Num minus one.

1036
01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:43.599
Anthony Taylor: and that tells us that there isn't a 3.

1037
01:08:43.609 --> 01:08:45.729
michael mcpherson: What I I get for everything except.

1038
01:08:47.330 --> 01:08:48.620
Anthony Taylor: Except one

1039
01:08:52.450 --> 01:08:53.899
Anthony Taylor: interesting.

1040
01:08:54.569 --> 01:08:56.849
Anthony Taylor: So let's look at

1041
01:09:02.970 --> 01:09:05.389
Anthony Taylor: oh, wait! We have to rerun this one

1042
01:09:07.547 --> 01:09:13.959
Anthony Taylor: after rerun. Actually, you know, what's the problem with this the way they wrote this, they reusing the variables.

1043
01:09:14.465 --> 01:09:14.770
Raugewitz, Tania: Huh!

1044
01:09:15.229 --> 01:09:16.059
Anthony Taylor: Online.

1045
01:09:16.439 --> 01:09:20.809
Anthony Taylor: So everything we do gets jacked as we work our way through this.

1046
01:09:24.922 --> 01:09:27.319
Anthony Taylor: Please enter a number. Let's try 2.

1047
01:09:29.579 --> 01:09:32.549
Anthony Taylor: Okay, good. Alright. So here.

1048
01:09:36.109 --> 01:09:38.139
Anthony Taylor: No, you know what it's wrong.

1049
01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:41.519
Anthony Taylor: The parser's wrong.

1050
01:09:46.099 --> 01:09:48.549
Anthony Taylor: Do you guys see why it's wrong.

1051
01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:51.740
Derek Rikke: And there's no commas and not separated.

1052
01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:52.060
Meredith McCanse (she/her): If.

1053
01:09:52.069 --> 01:09:54.989
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, there's no list. There's only one item.

1054
01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:58.100
Meredith McCanse (she/her): That's yeah. That's what I was saying earlier that so it only.

1055
01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:00.350
Anthony Taylor: Wow. Okay.

1056
01:10:01.806 --> 01:10:04.849
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I got it to. I got it to work now, though.

1057
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:06.560
Anthony Taylor: Oh, how'd you do it?

1058
01:10:09.190 --> 01:10:12.880
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I don't know what was different, cause I was following what you were doing.

1059
01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:14.289
Gebrekristos, Haftom: I think if you removed that.

1060
01:10:14.655 --> 01:10:15.020
Anthony Taylor: Prompt.

1061
01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:17.750
Gebrekristos, Haftom: Plug slash in from that first query

1062
01:10:19.450 --> 01:10:21.380
Gebrekristos, Haftom: from the first one, not that one.

1063
01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:23.460
Gebrekristos, Haftom: Yeah.

1064
01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:26.349
Gebrekristos, Haftom: The the the first query you have? Yeah.

1065
01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:28.350
Anthony Taylor: This one, yeah.

1066
01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:29.080
Gebrekristos, Haftom: Right, so.

1067
01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:30.979
Anthony Taylor: So what are you saying to remove just this person.

1068
01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:33.810
Gebrekristos, Haftom: So the yeah, the double backslash end.

1069
01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:42.649
Anthony Taylor: The key there. Well.

1070
01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:46.409
Anthony Taylor: see, that's still not exactly right.

1071
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:47.800
Gebrekristos, Haftom: Right.

1072
01:10:48.690 --> 01:10:49.910
Anthony Taylor: Because now we have.

1073
01:10:51.370 --> 01:10:53.159
Anthony Taylor: it's kind of an interesting problem.

1074
01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:59.219
Anthony Taylor: And one we're probably not gonna solve right now. But

1075
01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.230
Anthony Taylor: it's pretty cool.

1076
01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:07.030
Anthony Taylor: Try one more.

1077
01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:15.530
Anthony Taylor: No, see, it's still returning.

1078
01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.900
Anthony Taylor: Please give me the names.

1079
01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:22.279
Anthony Taylor: See? The problem is, is it's actually trying to give us

1080
01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:24.020
Anthony Taylor: more.

1081
01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:27.449
Anthony Taylor: Then the name.

1082
01:11:32.170 --> 01:11:35.010
Anthony Taylor: So our prompt is not returning.

1083
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:43.000
Meredith McCanse (she/her): It works if you enter in one, but that's the only option when for the input part where you have to choose. But.

1084
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.150
Anthony Taylor: No, no, no, I got you, but it's because of this

1085
01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:47.290
Anthony Taylor: right.

1086
01:11:47.290 --> 01:11:48.320
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yeah, and so what's yeah.

1087
01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:54.380
Anthony Taylor: What we're seeing is, yeah, it's just one item. That's why. So what we wanted to do

1088
01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:56.719
Anthony Taylor: is return.

1089
01:11:58.506 --> 01:11:58.980
Baro, Sonja: If you.

1090
01:11:58.980 --> 01:11:59.450
Sihong Zhou: Can you try?

1091
01:11:59.450 --> 01:12:03.449
Anthony Taylor: Hey? You could technically change that to a comma. It's so.

1092
01:12:03.450 --> 01:12:04.210
Baro, Sonja: Yeah.

1093
01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:17.840
Sihong Zhou: Can you try to change the 3? 2 numbers 3, cause mine is a number 3. It's just give me 3 name of the recipe.

1094
01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:23.420
Sihong Zhou: I got the name of 3 different

1095
01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:24.590
Sihong Zhou: Dean er.

1096
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:25.050
Anthony Taylor: Oh, I got.

1097
01:12:25.050 --> 01:12:28.810
Sihong Zhou: The yeah, change you to Alpha, change you to number.

1098
01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:31.419
Anthony Taylor: And sick. Let me.

1099
01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:34.709
Baro, Sonja: That didn't work for me. Oh, let's see here.

1100
01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:37.190
Anthony Taylor: Oh, to the to like.

1101
01:12:37.190 --> 01:12:41.839
Sihong Zhou: Great. Yeah, I don't know if it works cause mine works

1102
01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:43.840
Sihong Zhou: a.

1103
01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:46.089
Sihong Zhou: So it's not the problem. Yeah.

1104
01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:49.850
Anthony Taylor: That didn't solve this. But I I have a feeling we're having.

1105
01:12:49.850 --> 01:12:54.960
Derek Rikke: We? We said we said List 3 main course meals, and it worked fine.

1106
01:12:56.072 --> 01:12:56.949
Anthony Taylor: I like that!

1107
01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:57.990
Derek Rikke: Instruction, part.

1108
01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:00.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So

1109
01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:02.250
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna.

1110
01:13:02.250 --> 01:13:03.830
Derek Rikke: Help, the an ends.

1111
01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:07.460
Anthony Taylor: Keep the inns.

1112
01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:14.039
Anthony Taylor: And you said, List. 3 different dinner options.

1113
01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:16.700
Derek Rikke: List, 3 main course, meals.

1114
01:13:17.890 --> 01:13:19.779
Sihong Zhou: Yeah, just at least 3.

1115
01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:20.400
Derek Rikke: List. Yeah.

1116
01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:24.389
Sihong Zhou: Most of popular recipe. Mine works. Yeah.

1117
01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:36.219
Anthony Taylor: I see I didn't do what you said. So list

1118
01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:40.260
Anthony Taylor: 3 different main course

1119
01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:42.400
Anthony Taylor: meals

1120
01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:47.590
Anthony Taylor: like that.

1121
01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:50.760
Derek Rikke: Yep.

1122
01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:55.520
Baro, Sonja: But did that fix

1123
01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:57.920
Baro, Sonja: the list issue.

1124
01:13:59.270 --> 01:14:02.799
Anthony Taylor: So did you end up with still this, what we have on the screen?

1125
01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:03.730
Anthony Taylor: 5.

1126
01:14:03.730 --> 01:14:13.110
Sihong Zhou: No, there's just a 3 name print out, and each one being separated by a comma, and there's No. 1, 2, 3.

1127
01:14:13.670 --> 01:14:14.250
Raugewitz, Tania: Hmm.

1128
01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:18.130
Sihong Zhou: And there's no back backslash. N.

1129
01:14:18.170 --> 01:14:19.409
Sihong Zhou: Kind of the separate.

1130
01:14:19.410 --> 01:14:21.240
Anthony Taylor: Why, what's the result? Look like?

1131
01:14:29.770 --> 01:14:30.330
Baro, Sonja: Yeah.

1132
01:14:30.330 --> 01:14:32.649
Anthony Taylor: We really just need the result.

1133
01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:44.029
Anthony Taylor: I'm certain there's a way to mess with this and figure this out. It sounds like some of you got it, you said, yours is working, Derek. Show us yours.

1134
01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:48.960
Anthony Taylor: Share with me and show us yours, or send or yeah, either one.

1135
01:14:57.850 --> 01:15:01.169
Derek Rikke: This time it worked. I guess it hasn't worked every time. But like.

1136
01:15:02.690 --> 01:15:03.330
Derek Rikke: that's what.

1137
01:15:03.330 --> 01:15:06.900
Anthony Taylor: And that works. I mean, that is right. This 3 main course meals.

1138
01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:10.599
Derek Rikke: I put in 3. It does get roast chicken.

1139
01:15:11.130 --> 01:15:13.169
Anthony Taylor: No, no! Well, cause that work cause you can see.

1140
01:15:13.170 --> 01:15:14.119
Derek Rikke: See the list on mine.

1141
01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:15.570
Anthony Taylor: I'm yeah.

1142
01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:17.780
Anthony Taylor: So that works.

1143
01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:19.520
Anthony Taylor: This is.

1144
01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:20.260
Derek Rikke: I worked again.

1145
01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:21.070
Anthony Taylor: So here's

1146
01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:23.830
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna make this into a learning moment.

1147
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:26.729
Anthony Taylor: Okay, one test your code.

1148
01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:31.190
Anthony Taylor: Right? So when I ran through this earlier today, I put one

1149
01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:37.090
Anthony Taylor: and it worked. And I'm like good. I'm good to go. Everything's okay. Comes out. Huh?

1150
01:15:37.310 --> 01:15:40.700
Anthony Taylor: That one didn't give us the answer. We were really looking for

1151
01:15:42.490 --> 01:15:44.869
Anthony Taylor: So that's number one, number 2

1152
01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:49.399
Anthony Taylor: is, we still have a problem with our prompt now.

1153
01:15:49.530 --> 01:15:56.230
Anthony Taylor: Derek, and then, you know, Derek came up with a solution that works. I don't know if it was

1154
01:15:56.300 --> 01:16:01.280
Anthony Taylor: practice. He's an excellent, prompt engineer, or if it was just dumb luck.

1155
01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:04.889
Anthony Taylor: right? We're gonna call it. He's an excellent prop engineer.

1156
01:16:05.530 --> 01:16:08.000
Anthony Taylor: Okay, with little bit of luck.

1157
01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:10.360
Anthony Taylor: but

1158
01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:15.919
Anthony Taylor: I mean, it's just one of those things. So you have to look at the result. You have to figure it out.

1159
01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:26.759
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we could probably fiddle with this for a while, but if we do, we won't get to the probably the most important part, which is the next one but you. I challenge you not today

1160
01:16:26.770 --> 01:16:30.409
Anthony Taylor: to try to figure out ways to get it, to return a list.

1161
01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:38.859
Anthony Taylor: Correct kind of like what Derek did. But you could use what he did, or you could try your own ways. I guarantee you it is possible.

1162
01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:41.010
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1163
01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:42.730
Anthony Taylor: so we're going to stop

1164
01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:44.150
Anthony Taylor: with that

1165
01:16:44.230 --> 01:16:46.520
Anthony Taylor: hate stopping with it broken. But

1166
01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:48.319
Anthony Taylor: I think it's a good idea.

1167
01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:52.600
Anthony Taylor: Let's move on to agents.

1168
01:16:52.810 --> 01:16:56.090
Anthony Taylor: Secret, virgin man.

1169
01:16:57.630 --> 01:16:58.590
Anthony Taylor: what's

1170
01:16:58.770 --> 01:17:01.630
Anthony Taylor: an agent? So, to be honest with you.

1171
01:17:05.170 --> 01:17:07.609
Anthony Taylor: the most important feature

1172
01:17:09.670 --> 01:17:13.100
Anthony Taylor: of Lane chain is not all the stuff we've looked at so far.

1173
01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:16.040
Anthony Taylor: It was its ability to create

1174
01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:17.220
Anthony Taylor: agents.

1175
01:17:17.810 --> 01:17:18.750
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1176
01:17:20.430 --> 01:17:27.189
Anthony Taylor: So for the most part, everything we've done so far, we've hard coded what we wanted it to do.

1177
01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:34.999
Anthony Taylor: Alright. We said, Well, we want you, do this, and then do this. And when they ask this question, do this

1178
01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:36.580
Anthony Taylor: right

1179
01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:38.879
Anthony Taylor: well, wouldn't it be cool

1180
01:17:40.330 --> 01:17:43.340
Anthony Taylor: if we could do all this without hard coding

1181
01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:44.460
Anthony Taylor: the actions.

1182
01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:48.460
Anthony Taylor: In fact, we can even make it

1183
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:52.230
Anthony Taylor: almost seem like it's reasoning

1184
01:17:52.450 --> 01:17:55.940
Anthony Taylor: and coming up with the path on its own.

1185
01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:01.500
Anthony Taylor: So 19 agents allow our Lln.

1186
01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.479
Anthony Taylor: To make a decision

1187
01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:05.939
Anthony Taylor: on which actions to take

1188
01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:09.430
Anthony Taylor: kind of crazy right?

1189
01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:15.080
Anthony Taylor: So the agent requires a set of tools. We're going to give it a list of tools to do something.

1190
01:18:15.250 --> 01:18:18.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you want to consider which tools

1191
01:18:18.450 --> 01:18:21.410
Anthony Taylor: and make sure that you have access to do to use them all.

1192
01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:26.289
Anthony Taylor: this is the trickiest part of langching.

1193
01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:36.729
Anthony Taylor: not because it's hard to make work. You're gonna see, it's really not hard. Get it to work. The hard part is is figuring out what tools and how to get them to fire. And

1194
01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:39.900
Anthony Taylor: similarly to the list problem we just had

1195
01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:47.089
Anthony Taylor: right. You could create some tools, and then the Llm. Doesn't do exactly what you were hoping it do.

1196
01:18:47.250 --> 01:18:49.470
Anthony Taylor: Here's the problem with Lls.

1197
01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:53.089
Anthony Taylor: Let's go back to my, my select statement generate.

1198
01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:56.880
Anthony Taylor: Okay, while that's a fairly concrete.

1199
01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:59.780
Anthony Taylor: you know. Very like this is

1200
01:19:00.152 --> 01:19:01.440
Anthony Taylor: problem. Solve the problem.

1201
01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:04.220
Anthony Taylor: It's unlikely an Llm is going to

1202
01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:07.640
Anthony Taylor: go random on.

1203
01:19:08.130 --> 01:19:10.799
Anthony Taylor: Alright, but let's just pretend you built something.

1204
01:19:10.930 --> 01:19:13.969
Anthony Taylor: and you could do it in python

1205
01:19:15.090 --> 01:19:16.630
Anthony Taylor: just completely in pine.

1206
01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:22.909
Anthony Taylor: Alright! And but instead, you said, you know what? Let's just call an Llm. Have it, do it. Just output the result.

1207
01:19:23.010 --> 01:19:31.100
Anthony Taylor: The risk is that Llm. Just like in what we just saw may not return. What you expect.

1208
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:36.090
Anthony Taylor: The problem with Llms is, they all have a bit

1209
01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:38.850
Anthony Taylor: of the capability to be

1210
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:48.640
Anthony Taylor: whatever random, to to come up with their own response. So while you're developing agents, this is the biggest challenge. Okay.

1211
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:55.669
Anthony Taylor: an agent's a software program and has a goal.

1212
01:19:56.020 --> 01:19:58.612
Anthony Taylor: It's meant to create.

1213
01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:01.059
Anthony Taylor: a specific task.

1214
01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:04.150
Anthony Taylor: and it stores its knowledge for this purpose.

1215
01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:07.790
Anthony Taylor: It's able to carry out tasks independent

1216
01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:09.740
Anthony Taylor: of human intervention.

1217
01:20:09.810 --> 01:20:16.000
Anthony Taylor: So we're literally going to give it the ability to use a tool when it thinks it needs to

1218
01:20:17.790 --> 01:20:19.990
Anthony Taylor: and gets better

1219
01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:23.060
Anthony Taylor: if it's like, say, you're in a conversation.

1220
01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:27.430
Anthony Taylor: and the agent goes to say Wikipedia, and gets information

1221
01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:30.570
Anthony Taylor: alright to return a response to you.

1222
01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:33.009
Anthony Taylor: Then you ask another question.

1223
01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:38.520
Anthony Taylor: If that answer is in the Wikipedia that you just looked at. It won't go back.

1224
01:20:39.710 --> 01:20:41.700
Anthony Taylor: It already has the date.

1225
01:20:42.910 --> 01:20:44.460
Anthony Taylor: That's how smart it is.

1226
01:20:45.010 --> 01:20:45.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1227
01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:51.140
Anthony Taylor: yeah.

1228
01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:58.530
Anthony Taylor: So let's think about this terms that we've already developed a previous module. Remember our Rbm.

1229
01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:04.539
Anthony Taylor: Restricted Boltzmann machine. Everyone loved that picture, didn't you?

1230
01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:06.890
Anthony Taylor: Right? It was a recommendation system

1231
01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:12.069
Anthony Taylor: that we created for a media streaming platform something like Netflix. Okay?

1232
01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:15.230
Anthony Taylor: So if Bob and Alice were friends and Alice do

1233
01:21:16.010 --> 01:21:20.449
Anthony Taylor: that. Bob enjoyed watching Su Lander and night at the Museum.

1234
01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:22.090
Anthony Taylor: Rand was still his friend.

1235
01:21:24.575 --> 01:21:25.450
Anthony Taylor: And

1236
01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:28.480
Anthony Taylor: you know she could recommend

1237
01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:34.859
Anthony Taylor: the royal tenon bombs, because all 3 movies are comedies with Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson.

1238
01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:36.730
Anthony Taylor: That makes sense

1239
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:42.099
Anthony Taylor: the content. Filtering recognition system would play the role of a friend

1240
01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:53.360
Anthony Taylor: who retains the knowledge of the kind of movies Bob enjoyed and autonomously makes recommendations to him. For what did watch

1241
01:21:53.670 --> 01:21:54.710
Anthony Taylor: next

1242
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:57.119
Anthony Taylor: in the environment of a streaming platform?

1243
01:21:57.450 --> 01:22:03.710
Anthony Taylor: So question which aspects of the recommendation system are autonomous.

1244
01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:12.790
Anthony Taylor: That was just like

1245
01:22:13.770 --> 01:22:29.310
Anthony Taylor: so decision making, recommending autonomy. Bob does not need to prompt the system to give him a recommendation. The agent are autonomously collects metadata about content and uses behavior that will inform its own decisions.

1246
01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:36.799
Anthony Taylor: The recommendation system uses a deep learning network to learn and improve their recommendations without

1247
01:22:37.230 --> 01:22:38.610
Anthony Taylor: human input

1248
01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:45.409
Anthony Taylor: so as a task oriented system. An agent's role is to perceive its environment, using

1249
01:22:45.670 --> 01:22:46.900
Anthony Taylor: Spencer

1250
01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:50.449
Anthony Taylor: to act on that environment using

1251
01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:51.620
Anthony Taylor: actuator

1252
01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:55.699
Anthony Taylor: alright. So I told you, this is the hard part. Don't worry.

1253
01:22:56.190 --> 01:22:57.200
Anthony Taylor: It's gonna be okay.

1254
01:23:05.170 --> 01:23:07.410
Anthony Taylor: I decide, if I'm gonna show you this thing here, I want to.

1255
01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:14.560
Anthony Taylor: Okay, observability is another factor that affects how agents are able to operate in the system.

1256
01:23:14.730 --> 01:23:21.239
Anthony Taylor: So it refers to how much access to agent has to information in its environment. An agent can either have

1257
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:26.650
Anthony Taylor: all observability or partial in the environment of which we've created.

1258
01:23:28.424 --> 01:23:29.410
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

1259
01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:32.979
Anthony Taylor: So there are different categories of agents.

1260
01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:40.080
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, and you know what I'm gonna summarize all that in in Anthony language that we just talked about.

1261
01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:42.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay, an agent

1262
01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:43.360
Anthony Taylor: is

1263
01:23:43.490 --> 01:23:47.020
Anthony Taylor: an Ll. M instance that we're going to create

1264
01:23:47.050 --> 01:23:50.340
Anthony Taylor: that has has tools available to it

1265
01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:53.190
Anthony Taylor: to try to accomplish a specific task.

1266
01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:57.210
Anthony Taylor: Everything I just said could be wrapped up into that state.

1267
01:23:58.620 --> 01:23:59.560
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

1268
01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:05.059
Anthony Taylor: So now let's talk about different types of agents, because you can have multiple agents.

1269
01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:11.479
Anthony Taylor: The most simple of the agents is the reflex agent. This agent does not store hold on

1270
01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:15.100
Anthony Taylor: gay.

1271
01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:17.850
Anthony Taylor: Okay, here we go. An intelligent agent

1272
01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:25.320
Anthony Taylor: and it set hasn't actually senses the environment has actuators to act in the environment. Okay? So a simple reflex agent.

1273
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:34.769
Anthony Taylor: There's the environment, it. What is the world like right now, what action should I take? Has condition action rules, it acts.

1274
01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:35.870
Anthony Taylor: And that's it.

1275
01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:38.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's all it does.

1276
01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:45.730
Anthony Taylor: this works best if they can like. See everything if it knows everything.

1277
01:24:46.340 --> 01:24:47.470
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

1278
01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:50.120
Anthony Taylor: Good.

1279
01:24:50.490 --> 01:24:55.439
Anthony Taylor: The next type would be a model based reflex agent.

1280
01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:58.049
Anthony Taylor: Now they can have more details

1281
01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:00.630
Anthony Taylor: and deal with more details.

1282
01:25:01.019 --> 01:25:06.459
Anthony Taylor: They store everything in an internal model of the environment which is updated with each new person.

1283
01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:10.320
Anthony Taylor: The model has historic knowledge, previous

1284
01:25:10.570 --> 01:25:11.820
Anthony Taylor: situation.

1285
01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:15.970
Anthony Taylor: and some way to describe the parts of the environment that it can serve.

1286
01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:19.989
Anthony Taylor: Unlike a simple reflex that relies on a condition action

1287
01:25:20.150 --> 01:25:24.029
Anthony Taylor: mechanism. The model-based agent has some understanding

1288
01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:28.320
Anthony Taylor: of how the next state depends on the current state.

1289
01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:32.090
Anthony Taylor: and uses a set of rules to make decisions on what actions take.

1290
01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:37.269
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it stores the information about the effects of its action.

1291
01:25:37.890 --> 01:25:39.420
Anthony Taylor: That's important.

1292
01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:46.219
Anthony Taylor: If nothing else. You take away from this model based reflex.

1293
01:25:46.370 --> 01:25:48.499
Anthony Taylor: and actually the next one as well.

1294
01:25:48.630 --> 01:25:51.670
Anthony Taylor: It stores what happened

1295
01:25:51.690 --> 01:25:53.620
Anthony Taylor: when it did something

1296
01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.750
Anthony Taylor: effectively learning?

1297
01:25:57.380 --> 01:25:59.669
Anthony Taylor: I told it to do this.

1298
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:02.440
Anthony Taylor: Oh, and this is what I got back.

1299
01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:07.469
Anthony Taylor: Is that what I wanted that achieve what I was looking for?

1300
01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:09.610
Anthony Taylor: Nope, do something different.

1301
01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:18.780
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so that's a very important thing. But the main thing is is it maintains a state, and it keeps track of what's going on.

1302
01:26:19.170 --> 01:26:20.190
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1303
01:26:21.954 --> 01:26:26.489
Anthony Taylor: a goal based. This is a more sophisticated one.

1304
01:26:28.230 --> 01:26:36.039
Anthony Taylor: so in this one we're looking at, okay, looks at everything it has to state is all the things that the previous one had.

1305
01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:44.450
Anthony Taylor: But what will the world be like if I take action? A. So it literally is going to consider

1306
01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:46.860
Anthony Taylor: what it's going to do.

1307
01:26:46.970 --> 01:26:48.030
Anthony Taylor: And

1308
01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:54.750
Anthony Taylor: look at what that's going to do with instead of a rule set, it's going to have a goal.

1309
01:26:58.430 --> 01:27:11.749
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we'll provide it. The goal of what this agent should be doing, and it will use the state and what it sees happening each time. It makes the decision to try to achieve that goal

1310
01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:17.170
Anthony Taylor: by far the coolest, also the most complicated.

1311
01:27:18.210 --> 01:27:19.130
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

1312
01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:20.530
Anthony Taylor: So

1313
01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:25.459
Anthony Taylor: what do you guys think about agents so far? Are they like your brains hurt?

1314
01:27:26.340 --> 01:27:29.029
Anthony Taylor: Just so, you know, this is technically the last

1315
01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:30.880
Anthony Taylor: coding lecture

1316
01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:32.610
Anthony Taylor: of this cohort

1317
01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:35.220
Anthony Taylor: official one.

1318
01:27:36.810 --> 01:27:39.710
Anthony Taylor: the last one next class. You just talk

1319
01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:43.799
Anthony Taylor: about stable diffusion and other things like that.

1320
01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:45.840
Anthony Taylor: I can.

1321
01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:49.500
Anthony Taylor: But let's go look.

1322
01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:53.810
Anthony Taylor: So

1323
01:27:57.010 --> 01:27:59.140
Anthony Taylor: it's so fun to watch how these things work.

1324
01:27:59.906 --> 01:28:01.140
Anthony Taylor: Clear everything.

1325
01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:02.100
Anthony Taylor: Hi!

1326
01:28:03.430 --> 01:28:06.029
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to bring in everything the same, nothing new. Here

1327
01:28:06.690 --> 01:28:13.340
Anthony Taylor: we are going to bring in some agents, an agent and load tools method.

1328
01:28:14.730 --> 01:28:16.910
Anthony Taylor: Here. I'm going to

1329
01:28:17.490 --> 01:28:19.330
Anthony Taylor: initialize my Ll. N.

1330
01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:22.849
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to load the Wikipedia tool.

1331
01:28:24.770 --> 01:28:29.369
Anthony Taylor: Now this tool can go out to Wikipedia

1332
01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:31.179
Anthony Taylor: and grab information.

1333
01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:34.369
Anthony Taylor: We're not going to tell it what to grab.

1334
01:28:35.470 --> 01:28:38.650
Anthony Taylor: It's just going to go and get it if it thinks it needs to

1335
01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:49.040
Anthony Taylor: initializing the agent. So we're initialize the agent. We're going to pass in the tools that can use. And we're going to say, this is a chat 0 shot react

1336
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:51.400
Anthony Taylor: description agent.

1337
01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:55.810
Anthony Taylor: We're going to make it be verbose. And we're going to give it an ll, n.

1338
01:28:58.770 --> 01:29:03.529
Anthony Taylor: we're going to say, what is the age of the Mayor of the Capitol of Canada?

1339
01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:08.429
Anthony Taylor: That's a crazy question, right? Fairly specific.

1340
01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:11.449
Anthony Taylor: So let's see what happens.

1341
01:29:12.610 --> 01:29:14.140
Anthony Taylor: Remember, to run the sales.

1342
01:29:17.130 --> 01:29:17.960
Anthony Taylor: So

1343
01:29:18.340 --> 01:29:23.340
Anthony Taylor: we started a new Asian executor thought I should search. This is the computer.

1344
01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:31.729
Anthony Taylor: I should search for a current mayor of the capital of Canada to find out their age. Action week. Media, Mayor of Ottawa.

1345
01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:36.470
Anthony Taylor: Summary, the Mayor of Ottawa, head of Executive Branch level blah blah blah.

1346
01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:37.940
Anthony Taylor: hey?

1347
01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:42.589
Anthony Taylor: Did I get my answer? The following is a list of mayors in Ottawa.

1348
01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:47.039
Anthony Taylor: Until 1854 auto was out, so it went to a different page.

1349
01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:48.869
Anthony Taylor: Did it find? The answer?

1350
01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:55.369
Anthony Taylor: Thought, I have found current Mayor of Ottawa is Mark Sutcliffe. Now I'll search for Mark Sutcliffe

1351
01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:57.140
Anthony Taylor: in Wikipedia.

1352
01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:59.720
Anthony Taylor: Okay, then it goes out

1353
01:29:59.820 --> 01:30:02.629
Anthony Taylor: and it looks for Mark Sutcliffe

1354
01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:07.500
Anthony Taylor: finds Mark Sucklift. Look at that.

1355
01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:13.749
Anthony Taylor: P. Pay. I don't know why it goes for Peter Sutcliffe

1356
01:30:13.850 --> 01:30:15.140
Anthony Taylor: doesn't really say.

1357
01:30:15.836 --> 01:30:20.420
Anthony Taylor: I have found the current area of artemics. I thought. His birthday is July fourteenth next.

1358
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:22.790
Anthony Taylor: Now I will calculate

1359
01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:26.150
Anthony Taylor: and determine how old he is

1360
01:30:28.780 --> 01:30:31.479
Anthony Taylor: final answer is 54 years old.

1361
01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:36.420
Anthony Taylor: If that doesn't make you go a little bit like

1362
01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:37.390
Anthony Taylor: what?

1363
01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:38.919
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. What will

1364
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:43.920
Anthony Taylor: that agent was quote, thinking.

1365
01:30:45.570 --> 01:30:48.700
Anthony Taylor: how do I get this answer? Well, let's try. Week B,

1366
01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:55.379
Anthony Taylor: let's start with this. That doesn't. And then it found part of the answer and continued to search.

1367
01:30:58.570 --> 01:30:59.900
Anthony Taylor: That's amazing, isn't

1368
01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:02.390
Anthony Taylor: yes, Anya.

1369
01:31:03.770 --> 01:31:07.410
Baro, Sonja: So my agent had an error.

1370
01:31:08.260 --> 01:31:08.620
Anthony Taylor: Yes.

1371
01:31:08.620 --> 01:31:09.070
Baro, Sonja: Morning.

1372
01:31:09.070 --> 01:31:10.270
Anthony Taylor: Is there right here

1373
01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:12.520
Anthony Taylor: this one.

1374
01:31:12.810 --> 01:31:24.608
Baro, Sonja: No, it says an output parsing error has occurred. So it found Mark, and it found Peter, and then went, sought, and then went.

1375
01:31:25.470 --> 01:31:27.889
Baro, Sonja: It says, have.

1376
01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:29.840
Anthony Taylor: Remember where that happened.

1377
01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:36.880
Anthony Taylor: This is the one I fixed earlier, I remember, and I'm trying to remember why or what I did to fix it.

1378
01:31:37.940 --> 01:31:43.600
Meredith McCanse (she/her): The error message I got suggested that you have to say handle parsing errors equals true.

1379
01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:44.170
Baro, Sonja: Right.

1380
01:31:44.170 --> 01:31:47.750
Anthony Taylor: There you go! That was it. That was it. You gotta put that

1381
01:31:48.157 --> 01:31:49.200
Anthony Taylor: believe in here.

1382
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.920
Baro, Sonja: Verbose.

1383
01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.059
Anthony Taylor: Handle well.

1384
01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:57.720
Baro, Sonja: Next to it. Yeah, okay. I got it. Hang on.

1385
01:31:57.720 --> 01:31:59.010
Anthony Taylor: Errors.

1386
01:31:59.570 --> 01:32:03.290
Anthony Taylor: I think it was here. If not, we'll look it up. But I'm pretty sure this was it

1387
01:32:12.990 --> 01:32:14.589
Anthony Taylor: now, and the reason

1388
01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:17.259
Anthony Taylor: the reason that you need to do this

1389
01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:19.739
Anthony Taylor: whatever and make sure it didn't break it.

1390
01:32:21.510 --> 01:32:27.730
Anthony Taylor: The reason you need to do this is that these parsers are not. I mean, they can't know every possible scenario.

1391
01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:30.670
Anthony Taylor: right? They just don't have a way to do that.

1392
01:32:31.090 --> 01:32:33.220
Anthony Taylor: So ha! Look at that now. I got it.

1393
01:32:36.910 --> 01:32:39.139
Raugewitz, Tania: Yeah, I I got an error, and then I ran it again.

1394
01:32:39.140 --> 01:32:39.820
Anthony Taylor: Wrong.

1395
01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:41.320
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

1396
01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:44.170
Anthony Taylor: I just put the the argument in. There.

1397
01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:46.970
Anthony Taylor: there we go.

1398
01:32:47.950 --> 01:32:51.440
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, if you run it again and again and again, you may not get the same

1399
01:32:54.340 --> 01:32:55.689
Anthony Taylor: that should have solved.

1400
01:33:06.550 --> 01:33:11.699
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Is it ever true that if you run it too many times you get you start to get diminishing returns.

1401
01:33:12.250 --> 01:33:15.459
Anthony Taylor: Not with this case. No, but you will use a lot of tokens.

1402
01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:18.390
Anthony Taylor: I do want to point out something that's kind of funny.

1403
01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:23.780
Anthony Taylor: What answer? How old is he in your in y'all screen?

1404
01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:26.800
Dipinto, Matt: 54.

1405
01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:32.799
Anthony Taylor: How old is he on my screen.

1406
01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:35.000
michael mcpherson: 53.

1407
01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:40.059
Anthony Taylor: That seems odd, doesn't it?

1408
01:33:40.530 --> 01:33:43.999
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I didn't say agents know how to do that

1409
01:33:44.890 --> 01:33:47.060
Anthony Taylor: alright, cause they just don't.

1410
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:50.439
Anthony Taylor: But we could probably fix that, too.

1411
01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.250
Anthony Taylor: So let's continue up

1412
01:33:53.570 --> 01:33:54.590
Anthony Taylor: alright.

1413
01:33:54.800 --> 01:34:00.189
Anthony Taylor: So an agent with multiple tools. So here we're going to same things

1414
01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:09.100
Anthony Taylor: same. But the difference is, look at this. Now I will warn you guys, you if you don't have your open weather weather map Api

1415
01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:12.189
Anthony Taylor: in your environment variable already.

1416
01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:14.500
Anthony Taylor: This probably will not work for you.

1417
01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:16.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1418
01:34:17.286 --> 01:34:21.079
Anthony Taylor: I believe it was in the prep stuff. So hopefully, you did.

1419
01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:24.809
Anthony Taylor: But if not, that's okay. Because I didn't have mine set up

1420
01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:28.249
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So here

1421
01:34:28.450 --> 01:34:32.229
Anthony Taylor: we're going to load Wikipedia and open weather map. Api.

1422
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:34.350
Anthony Taylor: okay.

1423
01:34:34.670 --> 01:34:39.320
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna initialize it. Nothing. Fancy notice. We're using the errors on this one.

1424
01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:43.460
Anthony Taylor: and we're going to say, What's the current? Now? This is a great question.

1425
01:34:43.550 --> 01:34:49.430
Anthony Taylor: What is the current weather in the city where penicillin was first isolated.

1426
01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:51.950
Anthony Taylor: What?

1427
01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:55.560
Anthony Taylor: That seems fairly specific. Yet, again.

1428
01:34:56.340 --> 01:34:57.450
Anthony Taylor: okay.

1429
01:34:57.530 --> 01:35:01.300
Anthony Taylor: the other thing that's interesting is, could chat Tpt, answer this question.

1430
01:35:03.540 --> 01:35:04.610
Anthony Taylor: Let's find out.

1431
01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:08.820
Anthony Taylor: I think mine might.

1432
01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:10.030
Anthony Taylor: But

1433
01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:13.380
Anthony Taylor: let's find out. Let's go to normal. Chat, Gpt.

1434
01:35:15.970 --> 01:35:17.409
Anthony Taylor: and ask this question.

1435
01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:20.270
Masarirambi, Rodney: Fancy!

1436
01:35:23.290 --> 01:35:23.960
Anthony Taylor: What?

1437
01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:27.440
Masarirambi, Rodney: Oh, I said, fancy.

1438
01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:33.950
Anthony Taylor: So Chat. Jbtt. Did do it. But do keep in mind I am running for, let's see.

1439
01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:36.799
Anthony Taylor: So this is the one we're running right. Now.

1440
01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:39.549
Anthony Taylor: let's see what it comes up.

1441
01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:43.779
Anthony Taylor: And there you go.

1442
01:35:46.020 --> 01:35:48.960
Anthony Taylor: So currently 3.5 just can't do this.

1443
01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:51.120
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1444
01:35:51.510 --> 01:35:52.760
Anthony Taylor: so

1445
01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:55.260
Anthony Taylor: we're going to make you do it.

1446
01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:58.420
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna have. Let's see what this agent comes up with.

1447
01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:07.009
Anthony Taylor: I should use open weather current weather in the city where penicillin was first isolation, open weather, map.

1448
01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:09.360
Anthony Taylor: action, input, London.

1449
01:36:09.370 --> 01:36:12.490
Anthony Taylor: Great Britain gets all the information.

1450
01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:19.889
Anthony Taylor: The city where Penicay the first, was landing me B. Wikipedia Penicillin. Not sure why it needs more of this, because it already had that answer.

1451
01:36:20.290 --> 01:36:23.520
Anthony Taylor: But the city where Pennsylvania first isolated sledding

1452
01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:25.860
Anthony Taylor: city and located energy.

1453
01:36:26.550 --> 01:36:32.049
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now the interesting thing is is, we said, what is the current weather? That's not the answer we got.

1454
01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:37.749
Anthony Taylor: Oh, wait! Hold on!

1455
01:36:40.990 --> 01:36:42.860
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, no, that's not the answer we got.

1456
01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:46.390
Anthony Taylor: but we could see it actually did come up with it.

1457
01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:51.099
Anthony Taylor: Kind of crazy, huh?

1458
01:36:51.930 --> 01:36:54.140
Anthony Taylor: So this would be a place where you might want to put a

1459
01:36:54.270 --> 01:36:55.410
Anthony Taylor: the answer, temp.

1460
01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:57.370
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1461
01:36:57.890 --> 01:37:00.189
Anthony Taylor: this gets better. We're not done yet.

1462
01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:01.820
Anthony Taylor: Not yet.

1463
01:37:03.230 --> 01:37:06.860
Anthony Taylor: Now we're going to bring in some other chains

1464
01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:12.070
Anthony Taylor: to use with our agent. Remember our change that we did the other day

1465
01:37:12.270 --> 01:37:14.840
Anthony Taylor: we had Api chain. We had math team.

1466
01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:16.480
Anthony Taylor: So here

1467
01:37:16.490 --> 01:37:19.740
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna create. We're gonna initialize our Llm.

1468
01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:25.740
Anthony Taylor: we're going to give it a spec for the Api. This is our numbers Api again

1469
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:28.419
Anthony Taylor: and set up Api chain.

1470
01:37:29.390 --> 01:37:31.400
Anthony Taylor: Stop there. Okay.

1471
01:37:31.890 --> 01:37:37.410
Anthony Taylor: then we're going to create our own tool. So we're basically creating our own tool.

1472
01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:43.520
Anthony Taylor: They gave us Wikipedia and Openai up above, we're going to create a tool

1473
01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:46.070
Anthony Taylor: called numbers Underscore Api.

1474
01:37:46.150 --> 01:37:49.339
Anthony Taylor: and we're basically just going to create like function.

1475
01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:55.599
Anthony Taylor: It's going to pass into query. The results going to be the Api change, run? Query, return the result.

1476
01:37:57.730 --> 01:37:58.610
Anthony Taylor: Care

1477
01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:03.049
Anthony Taylor: math chain. We're going to do the same thing, create a math tool.

1478
01:38:03.770 --> 01:38:05.939
Anthony Taylor: pass in the query

1479
01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:08.979
Anthony Taylor: and return the result. These are really simple to create.

1480
01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:17.420
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Now we tell it. The tools are math and numbers. The agent. We're going to do a 0 shot react description.

1481
01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:24.709
Anthony Taylor: And the question is, what's a fun fact about the sum of 22 and 35.

1482
01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:28.099
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so again, let's take this prompt.

1483
01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:31.970
Anthony Taylor: Let's go to Chat. Gpt. 3.5

1484
01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:34.419
Anthony Taylor: and see what it comes up.

1485
01:38:38.140 --> 01:38:39.320
Anthony Taylor: It's not bad.

1486
01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:43.439
Anthony Taylor: It's actually pretty good, really.

1487
01:38:44.090 --> 01:38:45.149
Anthony Taylor: Let's try that again.

1488
01:38:53.510 --> 01:39:01.800
Anthony Taylor: Well, okay, chat tpts 3.5. Did it? Just fine. But it'll still be fun to see what our model.

1489
01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:03.600
Anthony Taylor: our our agents come up.

1490
01:39:05.070 --> 01:39:09.469
Anthony Taylor: So it went to the Api. Did it added up 22, and 35

1491
01:39:09.620 --> 01:39:11.060
Anthony Taylor: gave us this

1492
01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:13.720
Anthony Taylor: finish, Jane observation.

1493
01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:16.950
Anthony Taylor: and there you go.

1494
01:39:19.220 --> 01:39:21.759
Anthony Taylor: So we took 2 chains.

1495
01:39:22.430 --> 01:39:24.180
Anthony Taylor: initialize them.

1496
01:39:24.310 --> 01:39:28.659
Anthony Taylor: made them into tools just with that at tool and making a function.

1497
01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:36.169
Anthony Taylor: then executed. Our agent and our agent went through and figured out, needed to

1498
01:39:36.230 --> 01:39:39.679
Anthony Taylor: go to the Api and use this format.

1499
01:39:41.850 --> 01:39:43.019
Anthony Taylor: Our agent did it.

1500
01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:46.690
Anthony Taylor: I love the first one the best, because it like tells you what it's thinking, but

1501
01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:47.929
Anthony Taylor: still pretty cool.

1502
01:39:49.630 --> 01:39:50.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1503
01:39:51.270 --> 01:39:52.080
Anthony Taylor: okay.

1504
01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:54.050
Anthony Taylor: Questions

1505
01:39:54.150 --> 01:39:58.899
Anthony Taylor: about agents. Whoa, do. We only have 5 min left to class

1506
01:40:00.350 --> 01:40:03.359
Anthony Taylor: Holy Moly, all right. Well, then, we'll do this one together.

1507
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:08.510
Masarirambi, Rodney: Actually just a question.

1508
01:40:09.070 --> 01:40:09.580
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

1509
01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:22.375
Masarirambi, Rodney: As you do that. So for the agents, and for how long that, and and remembering how long? Typically I mean, you missed it, and I might miss it. How long do you typically store that information as so that it remembers

1510
01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:23.889
Anthony Taylor: It does, it won't.

1511
01:40:24.730 --> 01:40:25.599
Anthony Taylor: If they just.

1512
01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:26.990
Masarirambi, Rodney: And the cool thing, direction.

1513
01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:28.960
Anthony Taylor: Exactly now.

1514
01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:29.470
Masarirambi, Rodney: Aye.

1515
01:40:29.470 --> 01:40:30.529
Anthony Taylor: When you were doing that.

1516
01:40:30.540 --> 01:40:38.840
Anthony Taylor: So yeah, that environment thing and all those loops you were looking at that was within. And again, this one at the top is probably the best example.

1517
01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:40.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1518
01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:48.190
Anthony Taylor: this one, you know. You see how it's like trying to get to the answer. And it's trying different things to do it.

1519
01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:56.869
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's what it's referring to is its environment is basically that it's trying to answer questions with the tools we made available to.

1520
01:40:57.900 --> 01:40:58.730
Anthony Taylor: But okay.

1521
01:40:58.730 --> 01:40:59.160
Masarirambi, Rodney: So.

1522
01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:00.839
Anthony Taylor: And there are a lot of tools.

1523
01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:02.910
Masarirambi, Rodney: Right

1524
01:41:03.690 --> 01:41:04.940
Masarirambi, Rodney: will.

1525
01:41:05.796 --> 01:41:12.853
Masarirambi, Rodney: I mean? No, I should know. I just onto my own question. It would not be prudent to store some of this information.

1526
01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:14.310
Anthony Taylor: Says memory.

1527
01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:18.179
Anthony Taylor: we we didn't cover memory, and we didn't cover

1528
01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:26.640
Anthony Taylor: embedding, which maybe that's what I'll try to do on Monday for you guys. So it's not just a talk time for 3 h.

1529
01:41:28.140 --> 01:41:31.720
Anthony Taylor: and and we we can get some more of the lane chain feature.

1530
01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:39.059
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that one I gave you guys yesterday that extra one. I'm thinking of just going over that and explaining how to do that yourself.

1531
01:41:40.340 --> 01:41:42.870
Anthony Taylor: Okay, cause that has memory.

1532
01:41:42.990 --> 01:41:44.640
Anthony Taylor: and it has

1533
01:41:44.690 --> 01:41:47.760
Anthony Taylor: storing, embedding so storing files

1534
01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.340
Anthony Taylor: for later use.

1535
01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:55.080
Anthony Taylor: Alright. But yes, you could use memory with agents, but only within a conversation.

1536
01:41:56.940 --> 01:41:57.810
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1537
01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:00.420
Anthony Taylor: alright. So let's just quickly go through this.

1538
01:42:01.178 --> 01:42:03.519
Anthony Taylor: It's it's pretty short, anyway.

1539
01:42:04.010 --> 01:42:06.640
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna load our Llm

1540
01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:08.099
Anthony Taylor: load our key.

1541
01:42:08.340 --> 01:42:10.689
Anthony Taylor: We're going to initialize our agents

1542
01:42:11.370 --> 01:42:13.579
Anthony Taylor: and initialize our download.

1543
01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:15.949
Anthony Taylor: We've done this like a hundred times.

1544
01:42:16.140 --> 01:42:18.909
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna use the open weather map. Api.

1545
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:22.979
Anthony Taylor: It's interesting, it says, and Wikipedia.

1546
01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:25.500
Anthony Taylor: So

1547
01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:29.100
Anthony Taylor: how do we do both. I don't recall

1548
01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:31.499
Anthony Taylor: was a comma in between them. Yep.

1549
01:42:32.530 --> 01:42:35.540
Anthony Taylor: okay. Well, it says, use both. We're going to put in both.

1550
01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:44.010
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1551
01:42:45.883 --> 01:42:51.679
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna do this handle errors, Max. It rations passing. The Lm.

1552
01:42:52.770 --> 01:42:57.550
Anthony Taylor: What city are you visiting today? Include country, state, and province?

1553
01:42:58.270 --> 01:43:00.969
Anthony Taylor: I hate that. But okay, so

1554
01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:02.860
Anthony Taylor: I am in

1555
01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:06.270
Anthony Taylor: San Antonio.

1556
01:43:08.330 --> 01:43:09.740
Anthony Taylor: Texas.

1557
01:43:11.150 --> 01:43:12.530
Anthony Taylor: U.S.A,

1558
01:43:13.940 --> 01:43:14.880
Anthony Taylor: okay?

1559
01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:16.470
Anthony Taylor: And then

1560
01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:19.660
Anthony Taylor: we're going to the input's going to be, please suggest activity

1561
01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:27.220
Anthony Taylor: for the tourists today in this activity should be appropriate to the current weather. Try to name specific places whenever possible.

1562
01:43:27.770 --> 01:43:28.960
Anthony Taylor: and then we run it.

1563
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:34.779
Anthony Taylor: I will tell you. When I was playing with this earlier, you have to be pretty specific

1564
01:43:34.980 --> 01:43:37.110
Anthony Taylor: with the the input.

1565
01:43:38.660 --> 01:43:40.590
Anthony Taylor: Oh, we should have did this for both.

1566
01:43:48.700 --> 01:43:49.929
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna stop it.

1567
01:43:54.330 --> 01:43:55.300
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Anthony.

1568
01:43:55.850 --> 01:43:56.750
Anthony Taylor: Y'all.

1569
01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:02.669
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Is there a step when? So there's a step at the beginning where we go. Get the open Api key from the

1570
01:44:02.730 --> 01:44:08.729
Meredith McCanse (she/her): the dot and file. But we don't. The code doesn't ever do that for the open weather map.

1571
01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:10.189
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Api Key.

1572
01:44:10.460 --> 01:44:13.580
Anthony Taylor: It does it within. That's why it has to be in the.

1573
01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:15.290
Anthony Taylor: in, the thing.

1574
01:44:17.100 --> 01:44:18.500
Anthony Taylor: in the in your.

1575
01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:19.700
Meredith McCanse (she/her): That environment.

1576
01:44:20.170 --> 01:44:20.780
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

1577
01:44:20.970 --> 01:44:22.299
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Right. But even if it isn't, there.

1578
01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:22.710
Anthony Taylor: Really.

1579
01:44:22.710 --> 01:44:24.980
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Thing in the code that tells it to go get it.

1580
01:44:25.250 --> 01:44:29.270
Anthony Taylor: I know the the tool itself knows to go look at your environment for you.

1581
01:44:30.580 --> 01:44:31.370
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay.

1582
01:44:31.610 --> 01:44:35.699
Raugewitz, Tania: I had the same question, Meredith. I I just can't seem to get that to go.

1583
01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:41.940
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Cause. I have it in the dot and file, but I must be naming it wrong, or something like it's not picking it up.

1584
01:44:45.510 --> 01:44:51.819
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I I had to go put it in my environment variable. And then I had to like completely close Vs

1585
01:44:51.910 --> 01:44:53.690
Anthony Taylor: and reopen everything.

1586
01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:58.199
Anthony Taylor: So in San Antonio, Texas, United States activity should be appropriate

1587
01:44:58.220 --> 01:45:01.210
Anthony Taylor: action, open weather map for San Antonio.

1588
01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:03.640
Anthony Taylor: So you know what? I'm gonna try a different city

1589
01:45:04.140 --> 01:45:05.730
Anthony Taylor: with only one word.

1590
01:45:09.180 --> 01:45:11.129
Anthony Taylor: Let's see what they used in the demo.

1591
01:45:15.140 --> 01:45:16.330
Baro, Sonja: Use, Denver.

1592
01:45:17.530 --> 01:45:19.199
Anthony Taylor: We can do that. There we go.

1593
01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:20.730
Anthony Taylor: Denver.

1594
01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:22.590
Anthony Taylor: CO.

1595
01:45:23.290 --> 01:45:24.270
Anthony Taylor: U.S.A.

1596
01:45:27.460 --> 01:45:28.420
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1597
01:45:32.890 --> 01:45:34.030
Anthony Taylor: there we go.

1598
01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:50.260
Anthony Taylor: So it went to Arvada, Colorado, Colorado, State capital

1599
01:45:51.290 --> 01:45:53.560
Anthony Taylor: summary Colorado.

1600
01:45:56.450 --> 01:45:58.629
Anthony Taylor: what? Oh, my God! This is going on and up.

1601
01:46:00.710 --> 01:46:04.010
Anthony Taylor: Oh, oh, see! Yeah, I did. I ran into this, too.

1602
01:46:07.980 --> 01:46:10.719
Anthony Taylor: I absolutely ran into this

1603
01:46:11.340 --> 01:46:12.640
Anthony Taylor: when

1604
01:46:13.870 --> 01:46:17.280
Anthony Taylor: I get it, it basically, there was just too much

1605
01:46:17.590 --> 01:46:21.369
Anthony Taylor: answers. I had to try, like 5 different city combinations

1606
01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:24.280
Anthony Taylor: right to get the final answer.

1607
01:46:26.370 --> 01:46:27.450
Anthony Taylor: but yeah.

1608
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:29.720
Anthony Taylor: see cause it's like.

1609
01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:34.510
Anthony Taylor: but not parcel and final answer. You can see it came up with them.

1610
01:46:34.530 --> 01:46:35.600
Anthony Taylor: Tried to.

1611
01:46:38.150 --> 01:46:40.569
Anthony Taylor: I don't remember which combination work, though.

1612
01:46:43.260 --> 01:46:44.230
Anthony Taylor: But yeah.

1613
01:46:45.130 --> 01:46:48.580
Anthony Taylor: so this one, if you wanted to actually make this yourself.

1614
01:46:48.610 --> 01:46:50.839
Anthony Taylor: you'd have to fiddle with it quite a bit.

1615
01:46:53.910 --> 01:46:55.000
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1616
01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:07.420
Anthony Taylor: so there is a Max iterations variable.

1617
01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:13.089
Anthony Taylor: Did we cut? Did we? Did we already run that, Max iterations? N,

1618
01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:14.979
Anthony Taylor: so we could have upped this.

1619
01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:19.972
Anthony Taylor: and then that might fix the problem.

1620
01:47:27.580 --> 01:47:30.659
Anthony Taylor: but you know it's just a matter of you gotta fiddle with it

1621
01:47:30.700 --> 01:47:31.839
Anthony Taylor: to get it right.

1622
01:47:47.870 --> 01:47:48.780
Anthony Taylor: anyway.

1623
01:47:49.730 --> 01:47:51.759
Anthony Taylor: so you can see it's still doing stuff.

1624
01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:59.669
Anthony Taylor: But now that we've done 25 of them, this could actually take quite a bit of time.

1625
01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:04.659
Anthony Taylor: right? And how many times is it? Gonna look at these pages before it figures out

1626
01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:07.480
Anthony Taylor: that it didn't find what it was.

1627
01:48:07.940 --> 01:48:09.270
Anthony Taylor: but didn't

1628
01:48:11.230 --> 01:48:14.489
Anthony Taylor: great tourish activity for today. So

1629
01:48:14.650 --> 01:48:18.900
Anthony Taylor: so you understand, it was basing those tourist activities

1630
01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:20.530
Anthony Taylor: on the weather.

1631
01:48:22.610 --> 01:48:24.060
Anthony Taylor: So the weather

1632
01:48:24.380 --> 01:48:30.730
Anthony Taylor: scattered clouds temperature around 16 point low humidity. So we can go out to the Botanical Gardens.

1633
01:48:30.820 --> 01:48:32.210
Anthony Taylor: Absolutely.

1634
01:48:32.610 --> 01:48:33.820
Anthony Taylor: That's pretty cool.

1635
01:48:34.670 --> 01:48:35.500
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

1636
01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:36.970
Anthony Taylor: anyway.

1637
01:48:37.220 --> 01:48:44.690
Anthony Taylor: So that's it, guys that's agents. Okay, so next class, probably do that thing I talked about.

1638
01:48:48.070 --> 01:48:54.879
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna talk more about like the other AI things like image generators. We're not going to do it.

1639
01:48:54.930 --> 01:48:57.349
Anthony Taylor: We're going to talk about it, how it works.

1640
01:48:57.580 --> 01:49:06.290
Anthony Taylor: Stuff like that and some other upcoming trends in AI based on when they wrote this curriculum, which was only like a month ago.

1641
01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:08.609
Anthony Taylor: So there's probably 20 new things since.

1642
01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:11.929
Anthony Taylor: But we'll talk about the ones that they had that.

1643
01:49:12.180 --> 01:49:13.090
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1644
01:49:13.660 --> 01:49:17.400
Anthony Taylor: that's all I got for you guys. Thank you for hanging in there an extra few minutes for me

1645
01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:21.080
Anthony Taylor: have a wonderful weekend.

1646
01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:27.929
Derek Rikke: Can you put that file that you were with.
