00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:16.610
Anthony Taylor: Hi, everybody welcome class. Sorry we got started a couple of minutes late. But now we're good to go. So here's what we're gonna cover today. First, you know.

2
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:25.619
Anthony Taylor: here we go. So we're gonna talk about AI in real world. We kind of been talking about this all week. So some of this is gonna be repetitious. But that's all right.

3
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.450
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's alright. It's good. This is new to most of us.

4
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.529
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna do some more. We're gonna do this, add files. Github again. Make sure you got that down.

5
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.669
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna talk about. I love this craft.

6
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:47.029
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna talk about good project documentation and what is included in it. Maybe look at some examples.

7
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.070
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then we're gonna set up a virtual

8
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.690
Anthony Taylor: viable. I know that sounds crazy.

9
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.249
Anthony Taylor: But it's okay.

10
00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.630
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

11
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:08.679
Anthony Taylor:  welcome back how we do it. How are you guys feeling so far? Fist 5. I'm loving it. One.

12
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.800
sister.

13
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.550
Anthony Taylor: Okay, Mike, give me a thumb, which is a one. Okay. 4 is fives. 3, 3. Christine. Come on.

14
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:25.220
Anthony Taylor: Sandy, where you have 5. Alright. Alright! I see lots of fives that makes me happy. Christine, we're gonna work on that.

15
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.329
Anthony Taylor: Gonna get you to F 5. Okay, let's try. I would tell you. Today's class is not gonna get you

16
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.100
Anthony Taylor: okay? Which really stinks, because pretty much Monday you gotta decide.

17
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.759
Anthony Taylor:  But

18
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.829
Anthony Taylor: just take more. You're gonna look. And after I did not remember what number were you?

19
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.470
Anthony Taylor: This is why we have the camera on. So we know you're there.

20
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.989
Anthony Taylor: Alright, let's just keep going.

21
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.960
Anthony Taylor:  okay, so how do we interact

22
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.369
Anthony Taylor: with AI on a daily

23
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.730
Anthony Taylor: faces.

24
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.379
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, what they said for me to do, and I have never actually done this. So this might be fun.

25
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.670
Anthony Taylor: They said, Start the whiteboard. Oh, yeah, that's what we did. That's right.

26
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.520
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to start a whiteboard.

27
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.279
Anthony Taylor: Okay, everybody see the whiteboard.

28
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.570
Anthony Taylor: And now

29
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.459
Anthony Taylor: everyone can write on it.

30
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.930
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So what I want you to do is just

31
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:46.059
Anthony Taylor: grab a pen, and and if you don't see the pen go up to, you should see an annotate thing, or like.

32
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.500
Anthony Taylor: if, like like view options, that there Natalie just wrote

33
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.219
Anthony Taylor: good job, don't worry. I can clear it

34
00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:00.370
Anthony Taylor: alright. Does everybody see a pen or something. There we go. Thank you, Matt. Let's put some hair on that thing.

35
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.559
Anthony Taylor: and arms and

36
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.989
Anthony Taylor: eggs. There we go.

37
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.650
Anthony Taylor: I have no idea what you're writing.

38
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.499
Tania Raugewitz: I don't see a pen I want to play.

39
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:17.579
Dipinto, Matt: it's it's where where's everybody find? In bottom? Left corner is a little green circle with a pen in it.

40
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.900
Anthony Taylor: Okay for you. It's the bottom left corner, little green circle

41
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.319
Tania Raugewitz:  No, that wasn't my for me. It's like a dropdown that I had.

42
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.519
Tania Raugewitz: I don't get one.

43
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.500
Anthony Taylor: Who said that.

44
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.619
Tania Raugewitz: Tony. You have one, I swear.

45
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.179
Anthony Taylor: Look around alright up at the top where it says I'm sharing the screen.

46
00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.639
Anthony Taylor: You see something like that little dropdown up there?

47
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.709
Tania Raugewitz: Says view options.

48
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.939
Tania Raugewitz: Yes, remote control

49
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.650
Tania Raugewitz: originally annotate.

50
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.730
Tania Raugewitz: No?

51
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.449
Tania Raugewitz: Oh, wait! You said you're on the web app.

52
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.829
Tania Raugewitz: Yes, you do not have a pen.

53
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.300
Anthony Taylor: I'm sorry you have to go back to the zoom app

54
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.159
Anthony Taylor: not the second, but you will want to. Alright. Is anybody else not have a PIN?

55
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.250
Anthony Taylor: You, Tanya, you get to interact with us verbally.

56
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.530
Anthony Taylor: So I'm going to clear all the drawings.

57
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.750
Anthony Taylor: Boo. okay, now we're gonna start.

58
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.200
Anthony Taylor: so

59
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:31.049
Anthony Taylor: What I want you to do. We're gonna have a brainstorming session. You can use text by the way, it's way meter than the pen.

60
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:37.620
Anthony Taylor: And I just want you guys to put up all of the ways we interact with

61
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.949
AI today.

62
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.130
Anthony Taylor: just put up whatever you want.

63
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.970
Anthony Taylor: Just just start typing. Tanya's like door dude. I can't type.

64
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.970
Anthony Taylor: but you can still talk out loud. I'll type for you time.

65
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.330
Tania Raugewitz: So how we interact with AI every day. Yeah, how far

66
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:06.369
Anthony Taylor: you can just come up with one. Everybody come up things that we do with AI every day, because now you know the definition.

67
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.370
Anthony Taylor: and then January.

68
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.509
michael mcpherson: personally, or in general.

69
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.249
Anthony Taylor: It could be whatever you want.

70
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.409
Anthony Taylor: You decide.

71
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.300
Tania Raugewitz: Writing job descriptions.

72
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.090
Anthony Taylor: Hey? There you go! I'll I'll type that one in there.

73
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.719
Tania Raugewitz: Yeah, Chat Gpt is up there. That's what was used.

74
00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.950
Anthony Taylor: Yep.

75
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.909
Anthony Taylor: wow! We're getting quite a few here. This is pretty exciting stuff.

76
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.419
Anthony Taylor: I lost my arrow.

77
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:08.269
Anthony Taylor: I have a laser pointer, though. That's kind of cool. Can you guys see my laser phone

78
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.019
Anthony Taylor: alright? Now, who's writing on top of each other.

79
00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.619
Natalie Mason: I had a column over here on the right. I accidentally wrote on top of someone.

80
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.550
Masarirambi, Rodney: name and shame

81
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:39.530
Anthony Taylor: cool. This is looking good. Alright! Alright!  Let's see.

82
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:51.360
Anthony Taylor: what do we got here? So let's talk about some of the stuff came up here. See if you guys come up with other ideas while you get these ideas. It's a brainstorming session. Right? So chat t, vt, well, yeah, you use chat. T, Vt.

83
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.450
Anthony Taylor: that's definitely a

84
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:59.990
Anthony Taylor: image generation. Same video gaming video games definitely have a lot of AI components in them.

85
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.179
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And half of my, what?

86
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.189
Anthony Taylor: Oh, I'm not sure what I did there.

87
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:10.850
Anthony Taylor: Okay, walking through target. Thank you for acknowledging that excellent.

88
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:21.280
Anthony Taylor: alright health care. So what about healthcare uses? AI, and then and this includes the email models we talked about. So what about healthcare? What kind of things we do with health.

89
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.589
Anthony Taylor: and add.

90
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:33.459
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I bet the insurance industry. Oh. no, go ahead. Answer your question. Sorry I was. Gonna say, I bet the insurance industry uses it to

91
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.949
Meredith McCanse (she/her): a find ways to deny people care.

92
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.790
sonja baro: Well, a hundred percent, not necessarily

93
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:49.859
Anthony Taylor: to not necessarily. Well, yeah, you know, you're right. I mean, everybody does everything for money. Ultimately, I mean, we hate to say that. But that is the fact.

94
00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:51.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

95
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.720
Tania Raugewitz: but

96
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.660
Tania Raugewitz: awesome good that can come from

97
00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:00.489
Tania Raugewitz: AI and healthcare. In fact, it's used a lot

98
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.860
Tania Raugewitz: to do that

99
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:10.169
Tania Raugewitz: a real life example. Oh, no, go ahead. I was just gonna say, not enough. There's a lot more it can do for sure.

100
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.520
Anthony Taylor: Well, we're a long way from being able to do everything.

101
00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:20.020
Anthony Taylor: I know there's some simple, but that's why these classes are so important. Right? Because.

102
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:31.510
Anthony Taylor: like I, you know, let me say this, multiple times, there are definitely college programs. That do this nice and slow over a 4 to 6 year period.

103
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.860
Tania Raugewitz: Okay?

104
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.420
Anthony Taylor: You guys are, gonna pick up information

105
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:41.420
Tania Raugewitz: in a 6 month period to be able to do most of the things you see on screen, or at least

106
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.020
Anthony Taylor: to most of the things you see on the screen.

107
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:49.270
Tania Raugewitz: But in healthcare. Let's talk about an actual use case I had at healthcare. So

108
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:54.230
Anthony Taylor: company called Tenant Healthcare here her tenant help here. Probably not. Maybe

109
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.940
sonja baro: that's a big one. It's a big one. It's a big one.

110
00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:10.340
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So we have like, well, last time when I was there, which is, Wow, now. maybe 80 hospitals around the country. And one of the the big machine learning. And this was early on, because this was probably

111
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.429
Tania Raugewitz: maybe 7, 8 years ago.

112
00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.200
Anthony Taylor:  We wanted

113
00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:21.740
Anthony Taylor: to look at the care a patient got

114
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:28.029
Tania Raugewitz: and then determine if they were going to return in 30, 60, 90 days.

115
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.360
Tania Raugewitz: Okay? And we built out this entire model

116
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.370
Tania Raugewitz: lots of features.

117
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:39.110
Anthony Taylor: And and we were able to do it. And we did a pretty good job.

118
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:44.500
Tania Raugewitz: I think we were about 80, 85%. Now you think, well, 85%. Well, what good does that do?

119
00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.790
Anthony Taylor: Here's what it did. And this is what

120
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.060
Tania Raugewitz: made it so

121
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:53.680
Tania Raugewitz: is when our predictive analytics

122
00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.330
Tania Raugewitz: stated that

123
00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.690
Anthony Taylor: James.

124
00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.040
Tania Raugewitz: he's in the hospital.

125
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:06.989
Anthony Taylor: and it looks like he's going to be back in 30 to 60 days, based on what's happening in his care plan

126
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:10.490
Tania Raugewitz: alright. We then knew

127
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.550
Tania Raugewitz: to alert

128
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:16.379
Tania Raugewitz: the nursing staff medical staff and say, Hey.

129
00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:22.449
Anthony Taylor: it looks like the way things are going right now he's going to be back. Let's change it

130
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:31.229
Anthony Taylor: to make sure he doesn't have to come back right. And we're talking infections. We're talking. I'm not talking like chronic diseases here.

131
00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:43.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're talking things that that are happening during his care plan that are indicative of he's probably gonna come back. And of course, this also mostly was like older folks. It usually wasn't people as young as James.

132
00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:44.980
Tania Raugewitz: but

133
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.090
Anthony Taylor: but I mean it could be, you know.

134
00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:51.570
Tania Raugewitz: other things. So anyway, that was one that we did a long time ago.

135
00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:55.649
Anthony Taylor: To this day it's still in use. It's probably been improved

136
00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.880
sonja baro: because we have lots more capability.

137
00:10:58.390 --> 00:10:59.840
Tania Raugewitz: Yeah, okay.

138
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:07.259
sonja baro: I just, I would add one that is for the individual patient to help them take better care of themselves.

139
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:16.620
sonja baro: And it's specifically, you guys probably see a lot of ads on TV for things like dexcom. It's a continuous glucose monitor.

140
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:30.089
sonja baro: Yeah. So the the AI portion of this is based off of the readings that is being you're collecting. Right? You're able. Then, if you put in information around what you're eating.

141
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:51.200
Tania Raugewitz: when you put in, if you're taking insulin, etc. It will predict later, for instance, if you have a piece of cake, how much your blood sugar is going to rise, and what actions you should take, and some even add in exercise, or what happens when you take a walk before you eat things like that. It's pretty amazing

142
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:58.630
Tania Raugewitz: it is. I love this thing. I found out, after having it, that I shouldn't be eating cereal for breakfast.

143
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:00.150
I guess.

144
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:01.870
Tania Raugewitz: would never know that.

145
00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:16.049
Anthony Taylor: I mean, and it was many weeks, many weeks worse than bacon and 8. Okay. Provide innovative way of life, saving treatments. Absolutely right. A lot of things, especially now with Llms.

146
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:22.070
Anthony Taylor: They're able to make some breakthroughs that they haven't been able to make in the past.

147
00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.669
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And why?

148
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:29.219
Anthony Taylor: I mean, oh, because it's a I think for itself. It's making it. It's not.

149
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.750
Anthony Taylor: It's just making.

150
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.390
Anthony Taylor: It's finding relationships

151
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:41.459
Anthony Taylor: that we didn't know existed, or would have been very difficult to find, had we been looking for them ourselves.

152
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.160
Anthony Taylor: It's not thinking it's not creating.

153
00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.739
Anthony Taylor: It's finding. It's basically a fancy. Google.

154
00:12:50.420 --> 00:13:03.390
Anthony Taylor: Alright, except it doesn't just return results. It actually looks at the results and goes well, those results look like those results. Maybe we can put those together. Maybe they have enough similarities that they mean the same thing.

155
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:05.189
Anthony Taylor: Alright. That's a great

156
00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:15.429
Anthony Taylor: shopping in person. Online recipes, travel plans, police cameras, police cameras definitely do visual identification 100%.

157
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:25.369
Anthony Taylor: Not, you know. Facial recognition is all tabled. It's nobody wants to talk about facial recognition. But it's necessary. We need it.

158
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.839
You know, I'm sure Maine is glad they have it

159
00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.699
Anthony Taylor: right now today.

160
00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:42.640
Anthony Taylor:  so yeah, these cameras have some AI and enough behind them. Travel plans. The bottom line is is that for stuff like travel, plans, and shopping.

161
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:46.909
Anthony Taylor: Almost everything you do is eventually being fed into a mall.

162
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:54.530
Anthony Taylor: maybe not an AI model, but a model. a NLAN. L. Something having to do with M.

163
00:13:55.430 --> 00:14:01.129
Anthony Taylor: Okay, 100% recipes are an interesting one, because

164
00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:07.210
Anthony Taylor: there are definitely sites that, if you like, go to like all recipes.

165
00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:17.660
Anthony Taylor: Everybody does that on all recipes, I mean, yeah, of course, looking at what you look at, and they're coming up with recommendations. But their recommendations just like the Netflix recommendations.

166
00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.280
Anthony Taylor: I saw it over here somewhere.

167
00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:23.270
Anthony Taylor:  just like Netflix and Amazon.

168
00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:26.780
Anthony Taylor: They're both basically just doing clustering now.

169
00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:39.019
Anthony Taylor: They're certainly getting smarter and smarter about it. But it's basically like I was telling you guys the other day, if Meredith listens to the watches, these 10 shows

170
00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:45.220
Anthony Taylor: and Tanya picks one of those 10 shows. Let's recommend the other 10 shows that Meredith liked.

171
00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.109
Anthony Taylor: It's a ton.

172
00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:54.810
Anthony Taylor: And now we start building these profiles. Okay, so those are all. And Amazon no different.

173
00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:00.790
Anthony Taylor: Amazon's the same.  I mean, just in a massive scale.

174
00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:08.170
Anthony Taylor: Healthcare work both faster and smarter. Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean if I can just plug in symptoms

175
00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:11.240
Anthony Taylor: and get an output now.

176
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.000
Anthony Taylor: Dangerous right?

177
00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:18.010
Anthony Taylor: Plugging symptoms. Oh, that person has diabetes.

178
00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.109
Anthony Taylor: Maybe that works right. But

179
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.550
Anthony Taylor: here's where

180
00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:36.779
Anthony Taylor: the human aspect comes into Ml, we absolutely predict those things. We absolutely have models that do that. But pretty much. Nobody in the medical industry goes. Oh, almost said it.

181
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.450
Anthony Taylor: You got it. Nobody does.

182
00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:43.630
Anthony Taylor: It's model. Set it. Now we know what to test for.

183
00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:49.649
Anthony Taylor: Okay, typically, we want the model to give us like more than one diagnosis.

184
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.829
Anthony Taylor: and then we can go. Okay. Alright. Well, you either have diabetes or

185
00:15:56.510 --> 00:16:02.069
Anthony Taylor: gas, one of those 2. We'll figure it out right now. Okay, so

186
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:04.460
Anthony Taylor: and that's it. Right? That's it.

187
00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:15.570
Anthony Taylor: So that's where those tools come in. Really, really help e-commerce that basically the same as Amazon, but even more like my my wife has this

188
00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:22.690
Anthony Taylor: website that she sells her laser cut stuff on. Well, it's on shopify.

189
00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:29.419
Anthony Taylor: and I kind of have to manage it for most of the time. And just recently they came up with AI descriptions.

190
00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:33.020
Anthony Taylor: Oh, my God! Do I love that

191
00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:39.989
Anthony Taylor: right? I mean, I just push it. I just say, it looks like this comes up with this fantastic description.

192
00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:42.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's awesome. Awesome.

193
00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:48.049
Anthony Taylor: Website, websites everywhere, absolutely websites. And I'm we're

194
00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:52.150
Anthony Taylor: we actually probably won't. I'll try to. Maybe you know what.

195
00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:55.829
Anthony Taylor: since I'm not, gonna I was worried about getting done too early.

196
00:16:56.020 --> 00:17:01.139
Anthony Taylor: So let me find a way ways to drag it out. But we'll do.

197
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.989
Anthony Taylor: I won't do that to you very much.

198
00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:09.230
Anthony Taylor: website. So we look at websites and we're like.

199
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:20.029
Anthony Taylor: we're like, well, what do websites do? And it's like, well, look at this. So what's happening on the left is everything I'm doing on this website, everything that this website tracks

200
00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:25.890
Anthony Taylor: is actually happen is being recorded and you can't hear it. But it's actually speaking.

201
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:31.140
Anthony Taylor: It's moving really slow. Right now, it's kind of like catch up in a minute. It's gonna be like

202
00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:41.940
Anthony Taylor: there's events that are like watching which way my mouse goes, watching how fast it goes watching how? Where? I click on the board where I click this button?

203
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:46.709
Anthony Taylor: Did I click it in the middle? I click it on the left. Did I click it on the right screen.

204
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.539
Anthony Taylor: Oh, that that's right, because we got this stupid whiteboard up. Huh?

205
00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.340
Kevin Nguyen: Yeah.

206
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:53.550
Anthony Taylor: all right. Hold on.

207
00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:58.210
Anthony Taylor: Oh, he's talking to him about time.

208
00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:04.790
Anthony Taylor: I hope I let me find it. We'll bring it back up.

209
00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.680
Anthony Taylor: It's called click, click, click! Here, let me know why it's active.

210
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.650
Anthony Taylor: It's weird. Normally, it's really fast

211
00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:22.250
Anthony Taylor: today. It's not very fast. There must be other people doing this, Demo right.

212
00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:25.980
Oh, for fuck's sake.

213
00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:30.470
Anthony Taylor: Oh. I didn't know what did that.

214
00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:40.549
Anthony Taylor: So it's tracking so many events. You wouldn't imagine those events get tracked into email.

215
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:41.690
Anthony Taylor: What

216
00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:44.199
Kevin Nguyen: can anybody else see it, or just me

217
00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.330
Dipinto, Matt: like the lower room. Nobody can see it. Can you hear it?

218
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:52.920
michael mcpherson: Yeah, we can hear it. Yeah, we can hear it. That's so strange. All I heard was, for fuck's sake.

219
00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.389
Kevin Nguyen: Yeah, of course.

220
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.519
Tania Raugewitz: What's everybody now? It's saying all kinds of stuff. Hold up.

221
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:07.099
Anthony Taylor: It's telling me not to go. It's telling me to stay. I don't want to stay. I want to show what you're doing here.

222
00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:15.550
Masarirambi, Rodney: I was just trying to figure out who swore this thing. No, it was this thing. It was this, right here, let's pick

223
00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:25.520
there. Check. It's done. The button has been clicked. and that was fast. An adventurous type of subject.

224
00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:26.790
Anthony Taylor: Val. Can you see it.

225
00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.390
Anthony Taylor: Okay, thank you. Okay.

226
00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:49.369
Anthony Taylor: I just did something else. So anyway, this is one of my favorite things. So in the data class, we actually teach some what's called javascript, which is what is being used to make this happen. But this, this is an example of all the events that a web page keeps track. It keeps trending, and it goes on and on and on. Okay, in fact.

227
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:54.540
Anthony Taylor: there's all these achievements. These are all the things that can come up

228
00:19:54.620 --> 00:20:00.129
Anthony Taylor: and are that I've already done? What if there's a way to clear this? That would be cool?

229
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.520
Anthony Taylor: But after is coming?

230
00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.490
Anthony Taylor: Why would he say winter is coming. What is wrong with this guy?

231
00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:16.860
Anthony Taylor:  anyway? So so because they track all this, they have tons of information about you. If you go to their website

232
00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.220
Anthony Taylor: tons.

233
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:23.220
Anthony Taylor: They know how you move. They probably know which hand you're using

234
00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.970
Anthony Taylor: based on how you move across the around the screen.

235
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:35.989
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And what does that tell them? Well, that tells them if you're left or right-handed. Well, we know if you're left or right-handed, there is something wrong with you.

236
00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:37.520
Anthony Taylor: right

237
00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:39.820
Anthony Taylor: course. But

238
00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:43.610
Anthony Taylor: that's how that works. Alright. Let's go back to our Wi-fi

239
00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.410
michael mcpherson: what website is that?

240
00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.729
Anthony Taylor: It's called click, click, click, dot, click!

241
00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.389
Anthony Taylor: You think I'm joking. I'm dead serious.

242
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.670
Anthony Taylor: Okay, good. Our whiteboard. Everybody sees the whiteboard now.

243
00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:04.120
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I don't see your faces. Where'd you go? There you go. You're in the wrong screen.

244
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.060
Anthony Taylor: Get into your screen. Okay.

245
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:14.099
Anthony Taylor: back to this. Subject stay focused. He's still. He's still in the back.

246
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:15.910
Anthony Taylor: Hold on! Let me close that gap

247
00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.160
Anthony Taylor: shut up.

248
00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:20.880
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

249
00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:39.000
Anthony Taylor: so what else do we got here? We said websites, all kinds of emails. Yeah, absolutely especially for clustering for customer segmentation. You know, we wanna see, you know, we wanna create emails that get your attention. Well, how we do that? Well, we create emails. See who responds.

250
00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.860
Anthony Taylor: put it into a model.

251
00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:50.549
Anthony Taylor: Find out what kind of customers respond to what kind of emails. Now, we send more emails. And we just keep doing this and doing this and doing this marketing is a huge user of Ml.

252
00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.419
Anthony Taylor: right? And again, the interesting thing about marketing.

253
00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.139
Anthony Taylor: No one cares if it's right

254
00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.599
Anthony Taylor: right, because they don't mind sending flyers to the wrong person.

255
00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:04.379
Anthony Taylor: Why would they? That wrong person might actually buy it?

256
00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:05.370
Anthony Taylor: We don't.

257
00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:21.610
Anthony Taylor: we don't know. So let's try it, anyway, if it's wrong. Oh, well, we don't need to be accurate. Resume builders. That's definitely that's kind of new. Well, I mean, it's always been a little bit of that. But the the the generative emails that we're dealing with today. Very good at resume builders.

258
00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:26.739
Anthony Taylor: This is actually a big deal that up there that Derek also was that

259
00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:33.759
Anthony Taylor: Brandon? So yeah, this is a big one. SEO is a hard thing. In fact, I have a

260
00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:41.510
Anthony Taylor: a friend who he does this, for he did this for a living news.

261
00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:47.839
Anthony Taylor: and when Chet Gp. Did, he was like, Well, I better start trying to retool a little bit

262
00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:50.780
Anthony Taylor: because it's good. It's really good.

263
00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:56.090
Anthony Taylor: Does everybody know what they're doing? Search engine optimization? It's basically to try to get your results to the top.

264
00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:57.519
Anthony Taylor: When you, Google.

265
00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:01.470
Anthony Taylor: okay, which actually has become even more important

266
00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:07.789
Anthony Taylor: because, like, when you use bing chat. right? You say, tell me how to do this

267
00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:15.010
Anthony Taylor: bing chat basically googles it or bings it in their case right? And then they give you back pretty much the first

268
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.859
Anthony Taylor: thing that comes up.

269
00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:21.950
Anthony Taylor: So if your SEO isn't good. You may never come up on binge. No fun

270
00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.719
Anthony Taylor: self-driving cars. We talked about them the other day. Recall

271
00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:31.850
Anthony Taylor: ebay. This is pretty much the same thing as Amazon as far as the way it uses it.

272
00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:34.910
Anthony Taylor: marketing applications. We talked about them.

273
00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:43.820
Anthony Taylor: I can't. I can't move that one there coach money and finance. This is a big one. We actually have a boot camp

274
00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:45.640
unjust.

275
00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:50.469
Anthony Taylor: Ml, with financial data. 24 weeks been tech.

276
00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:56.159
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And that's all we talk about is finance and Ml, with finance.

277
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:57.999
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so absolutely.

278
00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:04.489
Anthony Taylor: that's a good talking to a call center is becoming a big deal. In fact, a lot of people are getting mad about.

279
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:09.120
Anthony Taylor: Google has a voice. Now that you can't tell.

280
00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:20.289
Anthony Taylor: Is it a real person? So tack that with their bard or any generative AI, that thing can help you all day long, and you don't even know you're not dying.

281
00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:27.000
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So it's pretty cool. But yeah, definitely. And other uses. But that's not

282
00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:35.870
Anthony Taylor: international defense. That's fantastic. I love that answer. Targeted ads. That's marketing. recipe travel, shopping.

283
00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:39.860

284
00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:43.190
Anthony Taylor: There. There was

285
00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:47.820
Anthony Taylor: social media today. And actually, yeah, yeah.

286
00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:55.699
Anthony Taylor: Mary, family.  I had this story going through my head. And the way, whether or not I want to tell it.

287
00:24:56.450 --> 00:25:03.510
Anthony Taylor: It's not a social media story. It's actually why we had Vhs and Beta and C, and then Dvds.

288
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:13.890
Anthony Taylor: okay, Clayton knows it. I could tell by the way he just popped his head up. But yeah, so the bottom line is is, there are certain industries that drive technology.

289
00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:15.699
Anthony Taylor: Gaming industry is one of

290
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:21.290
Anthony Taylor: okay, right cause to be truthful. All of our computers can run work.

291
00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:30.700
Anthony Taylor: All of our computers can run, excel right? And that's what most of us are using at work in. or we're on the web doing stuff. but

292
00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:35.119
Anthony Taylor: trying to play a video game on the in the cloud is awful.

293
00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.669
Anthony Taylor: So we need faster, stronger cpus and gpus.

294
00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:45.429
Anthony Taylor: So they drive. A lot of that. The interesting thing is is what we've started to see is with

295
00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:57.469
Anthony Taylor: now, stuff like social media because they have such a huge foothold. And even in business we're starting to see more and more. Hey, we need stronger, faster.

296
00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:02.240
Anthony Taylor: you know systems. So these are great examples from the field.

297
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:03.420
Anthony Taylor: Woo.

298
00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:11.910
Anthony Taylor: Okay. is there anything we haven't seen yet? Weather prediction? That's a good one. Fluid dynamics. Oh, my God!

299
00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.009
Anthony Taylor: And who's my hydraulics person in

300
00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:16.920
Anthony Taylor: somebody was

301
00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:21.109
Anthony Taylor: can't see it now. Oh, Clayton, oh.

302
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:26.450
Anthony Taylor: yeah, good. Good. So, and rendering absolutely

303
00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:33.429
Anthony Taylor: okay, absolutely personal assistance. This is gonna get bigger and bigger and bigger.

304
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:34.930
Anthony Taylor: I think

305
00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:41.350
Anthony Taylor: if I had to point any one place where I think this market's going to get really big. It's going to be

306
00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:43.970
Anthony Taylor: like on the phones as personal assistant.

307
00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:48.899
Anthony Taylor: Right? They're gonna listen to everything. And they're going to do what they do.

308
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:57.319
Anthony Taylor:  law enforcement. This goes back to like the police cameras and such, but not just that right? They can

309
00:26:57.410 --> 00:27:01.259
Anthony Taylor: get answers to questions that they don't always have.

310
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:12.489
Anthony Taylor: They can use the generative ais they can use, you know, basically use them like Google, but because they can pass in like a whole situation. They could get an answer. Obviously, that's not, you know, fast.

311
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:21.450
Clayton Graves: I read about a company this morning that is researching AI in order to fight child exploitation.

312
00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.749
Anthony Taylor: That's a good. That's a good

313
00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:34.229
Anthony Taylor: that's a good one, and I mean you'd be interesting to know what they're doing. But I'm sure it has to do with like visual recognition and and stuff like that.

314
00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:41.769
Anthony Taylor:  which? Yeah, that's that's cool. Okay, pretend I'm smarter at work. This is a good one, Matt.

315
00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:50.020
Anthony Taylor: That is a good one. Make sure you don't let them see you doing it. Spotify absolutely recognition engines.

316
00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.209
Anthony Taylor: Disney plus was that was that Kevin?

317
00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:59.300
Anthony Taylor: No, Brandon, you know Kevin works at Disney, plus right?

318
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.700
Anthony Taylor: So yeah. He knows all that stuff

319
00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:10.649
Anthony Taylor: insurance definitely insurance, you know. They need to calculate risk risk is how they determine what you're

320
00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:22.620
Anthony Taylor: your fees are going to be. Now, this is getting boring. So let's get through this. Is there any other thing? Seizures of diabetes? Absolutely. We will probably be using a diabetes data set

321
00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:27.759
Anthony Taylor: where we have a bunch of features. And we're gonna determine what's the likelihood that you're gonna get diabetes.

322
00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:29.079
Tania Raugewitz: That's a good one.

323
00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:36.939
Anthony Taylor: Absolutely. This is a big one. This is actually probably bigger than many of you might think. Just remember.

324
00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:43.149
Anthony Taylor: the the Llms are able to find relationships that may not be obvious.

325
00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:54.400
Anthony Taylor: So when you talk about like putting medications together. there might be like some kind of counter thing or some kind of back thing in putting to Medicaid that just isn't known yet.

326
00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:58.819
Anthony Taylor: and the Lms might point to it and say, Hey, there.

327
00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:00.190
Anthony Taylor: yeah.

328
00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:04.760
Anthony Taylor: job scans absolutely. I hate that

329
00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:06.730
Anthony Taylor: don't like it.

330
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:13.359
Anthony Taylor: but it's true. Okay, the cool thing is, we now have AI to make our stuff smarter than their stuff.

331
00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:18.230
Anthony Taylor: getting select same thing as chopskins. Very good

332
00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:28.170

And and I know my boss wrote the whole job description using chat. Tpp.

334
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:36.469
Anthony Taylor: so resume development

335
00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:40.200

341
00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:06.989
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this person was that person. They're a neuroscientist with like adopted in

342
00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:12.620
Anthony Taylor: data science. So they know, like they're like biotech, they can think

343
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:20.569
Anthony Taylor: they talk about crazy stuff. And I'm just like. Alright. Now they got somebody smarter than me. Dang it!

Anthony Taylor: Derek? Okay, siri. And Alexa.

347
00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:43.159

Anthony Taylor: Okay, all in. Lp.

349
00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:52.769
Anthony Taylor: I actually, I've written some Alexa apps a while back. And if they're they're pretty cool. It's fun to write those

350
00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.280
Anthony Taylor: not sure about this.

351
00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:06.350
Anthony Taylor: There is probably some use cases where you could use Ml. To like make better encryption and decryption.

352
00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:10.939
Anthony Taylor:  I don't know, I would say, that's a solid meeting

353
00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:13.760
Anthony Taylor: customer support.

354
00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.589

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.309
Anthony Taylor: spotify 100%

356
00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:27.269
Anthony Taylor: like, say, I always have students that do spotify email advertising spam 100%, which actually goes with

357
00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:28.590
Anthony Taylor: advertising.

358
00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:32.089

360
00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:41.400
Anthony Taylor: after hearing all that, does anybody have

361
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:45.239
Anthony Taylor: anything you missed?

362
00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.820
Meredith McCanse (she/her): But what about like tax preparation? Software?

363
00:31:49.100 --> 00:32:03.759
Meredith McCanse (she/her): If people, especially if someone's use the same software year over year, like predicting at this point in their life. They may own a house now, or maybe they are like other things that might happen in their life they would influence how they have to file their taxes!

364
00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:08.520
Anthony Taylor: Well, that's kind of like that one. I mean, I was working on day that that that

365
00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:14.729
Anthony Taylor: makes legalese into a speakable English right? I could do that with tax laws because they're nuts.

366
00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:19.560
Anthony Taylor: Never configure those out. I'm very bad with my taxes.

367
00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:22.070
Tania Raugewitz: I always say that

368
00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:25.350
Anthony Taylor: this month after month after month.

369
00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:30.879
Tania Raugewitz: agriculture AI pretty extensively with their self-driving tractors

370
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:38.370
Tania Raugewitz: and and disease identification and

371
00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:41.429
crop yield

372
00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.120
Anthony Taylor: self-driving track groups.

373
00:32:45.610 --> 00:33:00.270
Anthony Taylor: So you guys have. I'm trying to wonder how they, how they? How are they guiding? What are they looking at? Or do they put markers at the end of the field? The GPS data points?

374
00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:07.020
Anthony Taylor: that's awesome.

375
00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:18.989
sonja baro: I met a farmer for that has a farm out in Eastern Colorado this summer, who utilizes those tractors, and then also he can like

376
00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:28.299
sonja baro: operate the entire farm off of just the systems that they have, and their yields increase, and all that. It's amazing. That's a great one.

377
00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:49.019
Tania Raugewitz: It's like playing SIM Farm. I love same same thing, you see, like a road crater going down the road, and it's got 2 arms up and got 2 little white discs on it. Those are satellites, and it's reading to make sure it's going in a perfectly straight line.

378
00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.220
sonja baro: Wow!

379
00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:57.420
Anthony Taylor: See now that one you know what's funny is it makes perfect sense. And I never really thought about that. That's a good thing.

380
00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:04.479
Anthony Taylor: Other things that I have on my list. Actually, let's switch back to our slideshow. Now.

381
00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:10.920
Anthony Taylor: Well, that was a sufficient amount of extra fun stuff to do.

382
00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:18.980
Anthony Taylor: Click, click, click! Hi, can you guys see my screen since we had weirdness last time?

383
00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:24.830
Anthony Taylor:  oh, yeah, that's the next one.

384
00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:35.149
sonja baro: So travel apps like maps. Google Maps, ways. Smart home sharing Anthony.

385
00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.350
Anthony Taylor: How about now?

386
00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:40.040
michael mcpherson: It says I'm sharing. Oh.

387
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:41.190
sonja baro: yes.

388
00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:47.409
Anthony Taylor: so smart home banking fraud, alerts.

389
00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:50.919
Anthony Taylor: I love this autonomous vehicles like Tesla

390
00:34:52.409 --> 00:35:02.639
Anthony Taylor: advance the screen.

391
00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:05.979
Anthony Taylor: Nothing's on the top of my head. And I mean, trust me.

392
00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:09.200
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so now

393
00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:11.269
Anthony Taylor: let's talk about

394
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:17.179
Anthony Taylor: other things where Ml, our Ml, and AI,

395
00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:21.510
Anthony Taylor: okay. let's see how many of these we actually picked up on.

396
00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:26.700
Anthony Taylor:  so

397
00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:30.249
Anthony Taylor: sorry I'm looking to see what.

398
00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:41.210
Anthony Taylor: So what are some? What are some of the uses we came up with that were specific to finance.

399
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:51.730
michael mcpherson: algorithm trade and trading. And now artificial intelligence is starting to run investment

400
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:53.000
michael mcpherson: purchasing.

401
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:55.489
Anthony Taylor: That's crazy, isn't it?

402
00:35:56.150 --> 00:36:00.860
michael mcpherson: That's great. I think it's ever gonna solve it. That's what I wanted to do.

403
00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.170
Anthony Taylor: That's what you wanna do, Mike?

404
00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:06.670
michael mcpherson: Yeah, yeah, I'm a big money guy.

405
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:10.139
Clayton Graves: Okay, aggravations.

406
00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:14.070
Clayton Graves: So what? Okay? And predict the stock market.

407
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.770
Anthony Taylor: Yes.

408
00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:23.819
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I don't know. If you consider this finance or business with a little bit of both, but in accounting spaces all the things related to

409
00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:32.170
Meredith McCanse (she/her): the controllership of a company audits preparing financial statements. Testing like

410
00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.570
Meredith McCanse (she/her): different accounting processes.

411
00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:39.779
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Not that all those things exist, but so I guess. But there's it's happening like

412
00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.460
Anthony Taylor: there's ways we could do it

413
00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:58.290
Meredith McCanse (she/her): right. And there's this company starting to offer things like that, like black line has a thing they just announced a month or so ago, where they have a service that'll do sort of use AI to enhance people's accounts, receivable processes, or to manage people's account receivables, processes.

414
00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:08.560
Anthony Taylor: The cool thing is is about stuff like that. And again, I want you guys to remember this as you guys hear about those companies, you're gonna be able to do a lot of that stuff yourself

415
00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:10.790
Anthony Taylor: when we're done with all of this.

416
00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:19.139
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But yeah, financial advising is a huge field and amount. I would say, at least every class

417
00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:22.179
Anthony Taylor: that I have been in. We have a couple of people.

418
00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:27.479
Anthony Taylor: That's where they have predicted the stock market to a 99% accuracy.

419
00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:31.259
Anthony Taylor: Okay, 99%.

420
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.700
Anthony Taylor: And I always have to have this talk.

421
00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:40.229
michael mcpherson: 2,007. And I wrote, yeah, I read a wrote a paper that

422
00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:43.780
michael mcpherson: and Mds, as we're going to crash in the in the near future.

423
00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:52.900
Anthony Taylor: Oh, there it goes, part of your thesis cool. I didn't hear

424
00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.280
Anthony Taylor: sorry

425
00:37:56.540 --> 00:38:04.640
michael mcpherson: a year before the mortgage crash. In 2,008. I wrote a paper about that subject, saying it was going to happen.

426
00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:07.779
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. I actually was working at

427
00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:14.920
Anthony Taylor: at the New century mortgage since you know about that mortgage grass. They were pretty much center and cost most of it.

428
00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:20.830
Anthony Taylor:  II have. I was lucky I got out of there a month before everything went crazy.

429
00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.959
Anthony Taylor: But anyway,

430
00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:25.630
Anthony Taylor: yes. Now.

431
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:30.580
Anthony Taylor: let's talk about that stock market thing. I just said, because somebody in this class is, gonna do it? I know.

432
00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:34.050
Anthony Taylor: Okay. what would happen?

433
00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:49.539
Anthony Taylor: Emeritus is our Cpa. She probably is like on top of this. What would happen if all of a sudden an algorithm was created that could predict the stock market to say within 10 cents

434
00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:53.360
Anthony Taylor: every day, oh, yeah.

435
00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:59.890
Masarirambi, Rodney: everything will crash. I mean, it wouldn't even crash instantly

436
00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:04.100
Anthony Taylor: the chaos that that would cause would change the algorithm.

437
00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:09.940
Anthony Taylor: It would no longer make sense if all of a sudden you knew all of the answers.

438
00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:16.340
Anthony Taylor: And and this is something that everyone goes. Oh, well, we all know the answers. It's all by year stuff here. Nope doesn't work.

439
00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:21.259
Anthony Taylor: The fact that the answers were found would cause huge fluctuations.

440
00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:38.030
michael mcpherson: The Prices stock would would stay perpetually at that marker. So if the stock the day before that happened was a dollar, it would perpetually be a dollar, because everybody can predict it, so there's no way to say who said, Who will sell it or

441
00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:53.690
michael mcpherson: or buy it, because they already know what the price is gonna be. So if you already know what it's gonna be, and there's no fluctuation, I'm gonna buy Ibm tomorrow for this price. Then I'm not gonna sell it for you're gonna it's all gonna stay the same

442
00:39:53.810 --> 00:40:00.979
Anthony Taylor: financially, because everyone's gonna look at it and say, everyone's gonna go anything that's going up. I want to buy.

443
00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:07.620
Anthony Taylor: If this is going to be a dollar more tomorrow by a thousand shares and and make it, you know, make a thousand dollars.

444
00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:20.330
michael mcpherson: You're right. But the people that already have it aren't gonna let it go. So it's still gonna create a shortage. There's gonna it's everything will be leveled off. Whoever has they have what they'll have.

445
00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:22.079
michael mcpherson: and they'll only sell.

446
00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:26.770
michael mcpherson: It'll level off the the prices, and then the only part that will

447
00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:29.510
michael mcpherson: accomplish anything

448
00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:33.949
michael mcpherson: I would normally get into a whole conversation with you about well.

449
00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:44.559
Anthony Taylor: if someone, if there's a shortage that means there's higher demand. If there's higher demand, that means price goes up. and therefore the prediction is now wrong, because that demand didn't exist when the prediction was created

450
00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:51.360
michael mcpherson: right. But if if it's predicting to 99%, then

451
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:54.240
michael mcpherson: there wouldn't be a shortage nor supply.

452
00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:56.550
michael mcpherson: Everything would stay the same.

453
00:40:56.870 --> 00:41:01.470
Anthony Taylor: Here's exactly when this turned into a good lesson. So

454
00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:07.300
michael mcpherson: I'm still gonna be poor at the end of the day. So who cares?

455
00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:09.639
Clayton Graves: I'm still gonna be broke

456
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:19.569
Anthony Taylor: where? Where we? We're going with that, Mike, let me explain. Remember, Ml. looks at the past and looks at patterns in the past.

457
00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.610
Anthony Taylor: So if I create a model.

458
00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:28.379
Anthony Taylor: and it's 99%. Right? And tomorrow III invest based on that model.

459
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:32.949
Anthony Taylor: And everything comes out the way I expect. right? Because of my mom.

460
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:39.219
Anthony Taylor: Right. Eventually that model gets out. And then and then what we just talked about changes the pattern

461
00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:43.930
Anthony Taylor: because the pattern that it was based on was based on. Nobody knew the answer.

462
00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:53.500
Anthony Taylor: And that's the key here. That's the lesson to take away. When the model was created. It was created on the past, on the history.

463
00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:58.699
Anthony Taylor: But it was all of a sudden if everybody knew the answer. Pattern changes

464
00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:01.670
Anthony Taylor: make sense.

465
00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:07.559
Anthony Taylor: So anyway, this is one of those funny stories already know what's gonna happen. So you try to make it.

466
00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:09.190
michael mcpherson: And it's just too crazy.

467
00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:12.020
Anthony Taylor: There you go.

468
00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:16.700
I love that. I love that story that one's always. It always comes up every class.

469
00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:20.749
Anthony Taylor: We have somebody to to get in there.

470
00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:34.970
Anthony Taylor:  yeah, people have been doing this. The 2 Sigma securities quantitative hedge fund has been doing this since 2,000 s, they automatically trade more than 300 million shares a day

471
00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:39.850
Anthony Taylor: based on their models. Okay, within the last 5 years

472
00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:44.999
Anthony Taylor: algorithmic training has come to the amount of 75 to 80% of all

473
00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:47.629
Anthony Taylor: equity trades in the United States.

474
00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:54.650
Anthony Taylor: According to the real Finance magazine. 202,019 article. Okay? Pretty crazy. When you think about it.

475
00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:56.180
Anthony Taylor: we're just handing it over

476
00:42:56.870 --> 00:43:03.739
Anthony Taylor:  other ways. And I can identify laundry money laundering

477
00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:15.880
Anthony Taylor: and sanctions violations. It looks at all the facts looks at, you know, has a model that can do that. recognize satellites for real time, awareness of trading opportunities and commodities.

478
00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:26.990
Anthony Taylor: predict customer, turn in financial products. predict the likelihood of a startup success and venture capital and private equity industries

479
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.540
Anthony Taylor: that's crazy. All of these things being done today.

480
00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:37.210
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you guys are here to learn how to get part of that.

481
00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:43.229
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so what else? How about business cases?

482
00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:47.170
Anthony Taylor: What kind of business cases have we talked about? So far?

483
00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:51.480
Anthony Taylor: No

484
00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:53.470
Vasquez, Gabriel: marketing.

485
00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:59.619
Anthony Taylor: marketing, marketing is definitely in there. Absolutely 100

486
00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:09.560
Anthony Taylor: anything that has to do with recommendations or or marketing, or some way to get you to buy something that you didn't already buy.

487
00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:15.289
Anthony Taylor: Whether that be a service or a product doesn't matter.

488
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:18.770
Anthony Taylor: That's where they are the most powerful

489
00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:23.530
Anthony Taylor: individuals requesting information and do so through audio or text. Input

490
00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:29.510
Anthony Taylor: can do that. These days chat bots have been shown to improve customer engagement and satisfaction

491
00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:40.290
Anthony Taylor: leading to better retention. They're able to be on 24 7. Alright, we don't have to have the folks all over the world online.

492
00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:43.270
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, jet box have less folks online

493
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:45.719
Anthony Taylor: debt bots are less costly.

494
00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:53.450
Anthony Taylor: So does that mean they're taking jobs? Not necessarily means that those people that were doing those jobs are now doing better

495
00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:55.780
Anthony Taylor: or working. Else

496
00:44:56.010 --> 00:45:14.240
Meredith McCanse (she/her): do you have a question about that? I have like by and large every time I use engage with a chat bot. I find it not helpful, and it's frustrating, and it feels like a waste of time. Is, do you envision this getting better, and something that becomes something that actually helps people or just will it

497
00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:20.559
Meredith McCanse (she/her): always stay in the realm of like it can help with like a very small category of very generic things, but most of the time it doesn't help you.

498
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:30.430
Anthony Taylor: I would say there's no question it will get better. I completely agree with you. First thing I do when I get with robots and start getting 0 as fast as I can.

499
00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.700
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I'm that guy. I just get like.

500
00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:37.110
Anthony Taylor: okay,

501
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:44.559
Anthony Taylor: yeah. I'm like, I'm the get off your wand off my lawn. But anyway, there's

502
00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:50.139
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, it will get better. It'll get to the point where you don't know

503
00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:52.160
Anthony Taylor: you won't know.

504
00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:58.670
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and that and that is really close. really close, where you won't know

505
00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:03.980
Anthony Taylor: if you're talking to a bot or person. We're very close to that today.

506
00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:12.800
Masarirambi, Rodney: Up to a certain point is that just a question of power being user or like resources, because

507
00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:16.839
Anthony Taylor: training the the hardest thing is is getting the voice right.

508
00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:21.419
Anthony Taylor: And like I said, my, Google already did it. Google had the voice right a few years ago.

509
00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:27.600
Anthony Taylor: where they could use, you know, using like a Google Pixel, I can have it talk to somebody for me.

510
00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:30.610
Anthony Taylor: and they will know that they're talking about to a record

511
00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:34.309
Anthony Taylor: or a virtual character.

512
00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:35.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

513
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:38.370
Anthony Taylor: yeah.

514
00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:50.860
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, it's just a matter of time before we put all that stuff together, and we'll be on the phone talking like crazy, telling some bot a live story, and it'll be like, Oh, thank you, Natalie.

515
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:53.270
Anthony Taylor: Now let me get you to someone that can help.

516
00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:58.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But yeah, it'll just be going right through. So it's pretty cool.

517
00:46:58.730 --> 00:47:01.219
Anthony Taylor: pretty doggone to

518
00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:05.190
Anthony Taylor:  But manufacturing

519
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:07.870
there is an interesting one.

520
00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:11.820
Anthony Taylor: What kind of things in manufacturing. So

521
00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:17.920
Anthony Taylor: a lot of machines have Ml for just doing their daily operations. Okay? But

522
00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:20.610
Anthony Taylor: like, for instance.

523
00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:25.059
Anthony Taylor: my company, we you know, we bake. I told you we make like

524
00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:35.480
Anthony Taylor: metal hips and parts for your body. So we use a lot of lathes. We use a lot of Cncs. We use a lot of 3D printers. a lot

525
00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:38.880
Anthony Taylor: of them in 5 countries.

526
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:41.709
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we have sensors on all of them.

527
00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:45.309
Anthony Taylor: All of those sensors report back to me.

528
00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:55.060
Anthony Taylor: and we create models that watch those sensors and look for trends, look for issues. So we know when to maintain machines to prevent downtime.

529
00:47:55.860 --> 00:48:01.249
Anthony Taylor: That's probably the most common use, and it's been around for a long time. But it's getting better.

530
00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:06.759
Anthony Taylor: It's getting to the point where we can pretty much completely eliminate.

531
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:10.400
Anthony Taylor: you know, downtime more than just normal standard maintenance.

532
00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:15.050
Anthony Taylor: So it's very, very cool. Inventory management.

533
00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:18.160
Anthony Taylor: Dealing with automated tasks.

534
00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:29.349
Anthony Taylor: A lot of them can do that consumer buying patterns, predicting maintenance fares. We talked about that repair costs, improving safety. reducing unnecessary emissions.

535
00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:49.290
Anthony Taylor: utilizing data sensors, provide real time, data, make most 50 of resources. That's improving state. That's another thing we do. We look at the waste that comes off of these machines, and then we figure out ways that we could maybe cut differently or do so or buy the materials differently, so that we would have less waste.

536
00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.959
Anthony Taylor: So that's kind of a big deal too

537
00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:55.330
Anthony Taylor: programming. Anyone use github co-pilot?

538
00:48:57.290 --> 00:48:59.120
Anthony Taylor: No, don't. It's all

539
00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:03.759
Anthony Taylor: I shouldn't say that it's not terrible, but it's not very good

540
00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:10.729
Anthony Taylor: it. Basically, they use all of the public repositories and Github and trained in AI model.

541
00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:15.549
Anthony Taylor: So you can bring it up like a Ds code. And as you type code, it'll basically fill it in for

542
00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:23.059
Anthony Taylor: okay. But it's filling it in based on somebody else's code. And it's not always right. Fact

543
00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:35.780
Anthony Taylor: in my experience with it, it's often wrong way more often than like your Chats Utts, and your bars and stuff like that. But it is a thing, and it is very helpful.

544
00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:44.140
Anthony Taylor: The the data assistant that uses Chad tpt on the tool I use at work. Oh, my God, it saves us tremendous amounts of time.

545
00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:45.680
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

546
00:49:46.460 --> 00:50:01.499
Anthony Taylor: medical field. I'm just gonna kind of zoom through these feel like, feel like we've been doing this a long time. Medical field facilitating documentation for medical data. Love. This one of the things you can do is it can translate damn doctors writing

547
00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:04.630
Anthony Taylor: holy cow!

548
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:08.790
Anthony Taylor: All the billers and coders in the world are screaming

549
00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:10.189
Anthony Taylor: a cheer.

550
00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:15.989
Anthony Taylor: Okay, yes, they can do it. You can train it to do that these days.

551
00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:24.079
Anthony Taylor: But not only that we can look at all. They wrote this, they said, This is this, and then they did this. Icd 9. And it's like, Well, I should say.

552
00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:28.699
Anthony Taylor: but anyway and they did this, and then that doesn't make sense. It doesn't match up.

553
00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:35.029
Anthony Taylor: So let's we're not going to tell a doctor. He's wrong, which is ridiculous if he is yet.

554
00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:37.670
Anthony Taylor: But what we'll do is send out a note.

555
00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:46.339
Anthony Taylor: We just saw this, and we're thinking maybe you should look at that again unless you're the insurance company. Then you just deny the claim and make them go look at it again.

556
00:50:46.350 --> 00:50:49.889
Anthony Taylor: and then they just write something that doesn't mean anything, but it'll ask the insurance

557
00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:54.799
Anthony Taylor: whatever. How medical worlds and telling all their secrets.

558
00:50:54.970 --> 00:51:05.289
Anthony Taylor: One of the things we're doing, looking at at dicom images, X-rays stuff like that to to come up with ways to. You know how we're gonna

559
00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:09.390
Anthony Taylor: there's all kinds of things like for us. We're looking at how we put in parts.

560
00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:17.550
Anthony Taylor:  for X-rays and stuff. I mean, yeah, radiologists will never be eliminated.

561
00:51:17.590 --> 00:51:25.310
Anthony Taylor: But it's we can get pretty good at saying there's nothing there. Okay, like, really good at that

562
00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:30.530
Anthony Taylor: and not so we're not going to get well, we're not. We're pretending that we can't diagnose it yet.

563
00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:38.040
Anthony Taylor: So like, if there is something there. what most of the machine learning models are doing today is they're flagging it and saying, you think it's this.

564
00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:43.489
Anthony Taylor: even though it like 99%. Sure it is this. But we need radiologists throughout. So

565
00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:45.240
Anthony Taylor: we just we we say that

566
00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:46.330
Anthony Taylor: think.

567
00:51:46.590 --> 00:51:51.720
Anthony Taylor: customize treatment for patients, even performing surgeries.

568
00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:53.890
Okay.

569
00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:57.389
Anthony Taylor: so what was the one, I was gonna say.

570
00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.060
Anthony Taylor: and come back to me.

571
00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:01.910
Anthony Taylor: A

572
00:52:03.690 --> 00:52:05.350
Anthony Taylor: at transcripts.

573
00:52:05.770 --> 00:52:10.709
Anthony Taylor: All kinds of stuff. Right? Doctor can just talk to it because they know you so good now.

574
00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:18.700
Anthony Taylor: right? A doctor could just talk to it, and it takes all the notes. You don't need an MA. In the room paying paying them minimum wage.

575
00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:24.340
Anthony Taylor: Genomics. So one really great example

576
00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:29.139
Anthony Taylor: of of some usage that came out there.

577
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:32.199
Anthony Taylor: a company called Variant

578
00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:41.020
Anthony Taylor: is calling this process by which researchers determine the variations between a patient's sample DNA and a reference

579
00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:42.340
Anthony Taylor: DNA,

580
00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:47.530
Anthony Taylor: and they're determining illnesses and such like, that.

581
00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:56.380
Anthony Taylor: I mean. And this used to take weeks or months to figure out. Now it's down to minutes or seconds.

582
00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:03.980
Anthony Taylor: Okay, which is crazy. It's a totally cool thing. We have a link to that paper? Now.

583
00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:08.389
Anthony Taylor: before concluding this section, I have to bring up racial bias

584
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:11.880
Anthony Taylor: and all of the biases

585
00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:16.470
Anthony Taylor: that are in our data today. Yes, it's there

586
00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:19.249
Anthony Taylor: 100%. You need to be aware of it.

587
00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:21.290
Anthony Taylor: We need to try to eliminate it.

588
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:27.250
Anthony Taylor: It will be complicated to eliminate it. And that's and that's not

589
00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:32.550
Anthony Taylor: necessarily a state of the industry as much as state of the data.

590
00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:34.240
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

591
00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:40.599
Anthony Taylor:  countries that don't have a lot of easy access to Internet

592
00:53:40.890 --> 00:53:45.319
Anthony Taylor: don't have a lot of social media. Don't have a lot of pictures online.

593
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:50.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay, they're not posting, hey? Here's my kid's birthday. There's no Internet

594
00:53:51.780 --> 00:54:01.300
Anthony Taylor: or the Internet is sketchy or they don't have cell phones. Okay, this could be anything. This doesn't have to be a particular race. It could be any race, any culture

595
00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:07.630
Anthony Taylor: that just doesn't have those resources. So what does that mean? Those

596
00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:11.989
Anthony Taylor: cultures, those groups are not well represented.

597
00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:26.519
Anthony Taylor: And I mean, you know, we can. We can talk about, you know, give free cell phones to everybody we can talk about, give free Internet to everybody. Bill Gates has been trying to do that for years.

598
00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:35.010
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But I mean, it's it's not gonna change in months. It's not gonna change in years. It's gonna change in decades.

599
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:46.269
Anthony Taylor: All right. So that bias will be there. We got to figure out how to work with it as long as we acknowledge, understand and don't.

600
00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:57.740
Anthony Taylor: The the big thing is is like, I said about diabetes. Okay, like the medical diagnosis. If if we see an answer from an AI from an email, and we just say, that's the answer.

601
00:54:58.690 --> 00:54:59.779
Anthony Taylor: We've all fate.

602
00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:07.640
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we have to take into consideration all those other factors. and we will. And we do

603
00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:09.390
Anthony Taylor: sometimes.

604
00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:12.090
Anthony Taylor:  okay.

605
00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:14.789
Anthony Taylor: wow! Dying over you.

606
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:22.769
Anthony Taylor: For daily life, scripts for Youtube. That's a big one. News articles, blog articles, emails, cover letters.

607
00:55:23.690 --> 00:55:28.230
Anthony Taylor: all those things we can use AI for today. Every day

608
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:29.890
Anthony Taylor: any of you should.

609
00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:46.469
Anthony Taylor:  yeah, I don't know why we're bringing up transformers again here, but transformers, you know, the transformer models that take the words and figure out what context they're in. They're getting stronger. They're getting better. Better, they get

610
00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:49.550
Anthony Taylor: the better they're going to be able to do generative AI

611
00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:51.490
Anthony Taylor: alright or in here. Yeah.

612
00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:56.880
Anthony Taylor:  self-driving cars. We've talked about those

613
00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:00.780
Anthony Taylor: questions

614
00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:03.770
Anthony Taylor: that took a long time.

615
00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:10.439
Anthony Taylor: I feel like that. Took a long time. Did that thing, you know it's only been an hour. I don't know

616
00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:12.620
Anthony Taylor: any questions, any thoughts.

617
00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:21.200
Anthony Taylor: no more cool thoughts. Are you guys just talked out of this topic?

618
00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:28.859
Natalie Mason: What are your thoughts on the AI girlfriends? Why not? I agree.

619
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:34.309
Anthony Taylor: I think it'll take a lot of pressure off of a ladies that don't wanna don't want them real.

620
00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:37.290
Natalie Mason: What about?

621
00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:42.200
Natalie Mason: I'm sure they'll come in handy.

622
00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:44.310
Anthony Taylor: Oh, my,

623
00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:46.490
Anthony Taylor: yeah, the

624
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:52.210
Anthony Taylor: did. My stand-up comedy brain just went.

625
00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:56.549
Anthony Taylor: No, the reality is is, you know that

626
00:56:57.460 --> 00:56:59.120
Anthony Taylor: that industry.

627
00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:06.939
Anthony Taylor: one of the biggest striving forces in technology and has been for 50, 60 years.

628
00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:13.150
Anthony Taylor: You know, II was talking about Vhs and Beta. okay.

629
00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:23.319
Anthony Taylor: does everybody, does anybody know what a beta videotape is? We've probably got a couple people. Okay, cool. Right? Vhs videotapes. We all know what those are right.

630
00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:25.129
Anthony Taylor: Well, everybody that young.

631
00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:27.170
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Well.

632
00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:32.679
Anthony Taylor: in the beginning beta tapes were better quality cheaper to make

633
00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:42.199
Anthony Taylor: easier to use. They were freaking fantastic. but they told a certain industry. You can't put your content on our tapes.

634
00:57:43.650 --> 00:57:47.070
Anthony Taylor: Months later they no longer existed.

635
00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:53.869
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you don't know the industry. Think about the AI go

636
00:57:54.730 --> 00:58:02.670
Anthony Taylor: all right. So yeah. they didn't exist anymore. Vhs said, Sure, we're not very popular. Come on, what could it hurt?

637
00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:05.830
Anthony Taylor: Whole industry crush

638
00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:09.320
Anthony Taylor: because of that one thing

639
00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:23.710
Anthony Taylor: alright. So anyway, that's just I love that story. It's great story. And actually, I think that's the best way I've ever told it without feeling like somebody's gonna say something to the Ssa. I know it. Okay, so

640
00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:25.540
Anthony Taylor: let's move on

641
00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:33.999
Anthony Taylor: unless there's more questions. Oh, here's all the this is like some of the stuff I just talked about. I didn't know they had this look at that.

642
00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:37.769
Anthony Taylor: We. So we talked about all of this stuff, and then some.

643
00:58:39.250 --> 00:58:50.530
Anthony Taylor:  alright! Let's get our hands on the keyboard. I'm not running late, either.

644
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:52.130
Anthony Taylor: Where's Breakett?

645
00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:55.969
Anthony Taylor: Oh, wow! Yeah, we got a ways to a break.

646
00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:59.090
Anthony Taylor: Let's get our hands on keyboards. Okay?

647
00:58:59.170 --> 00:59:02.140
Anthony Taylor: So first, we need to determine if

648
00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:08.129
Anthony Taylor: we have conned that, how do we do that? Open? Get bash or terminal? Don't care which.

649
00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:11.210
Anthony Taylor: whatever you use or prefer.

650
00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:16.060
Anthony Taylor: and then in here, wait.

651
00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:26.790
Anthony Taylor: Well, we'll do this, and then we'll jump into the terminal type. Conda. space, dash

652
00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:27.630
Anthony Taylor: the

653
00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:31.780
Anthony Taylor: enter. Nope, that, wasn't it? And

654
00:59:33.490 --> 00:59:34.620
Anthony Taylor: dash! Dash!

655
00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:37.790
Anthony Taylor: There it is, Conda Dash, Dash!

656
00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:45.860
Anthony Taylor: And what we're hoping you're gonna see is something like you can have a different number. That's okay. Number doesn't matter. I need to update my number. You should.

657
00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:53.760
Anthony Taylor: So is this not working for anybody?

658
00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:58.079
Meredith McCanse (she/her): See? A lot of concerned faces have it.

659
00:59:58.120 --> 00:59:59.930
Dipinto, Matt: I'm getting a

660
01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:13.210
Dipinto, Matt: condo is not recognized, but I definitely do have anaconda and Condon. So a lot of people

661
01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:16.400
Anthony Taylor: who got something back that says Conda, and a number.

662
01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:21.920
michael mcpherson: I can take it. I can get it in terminal, but not in bash.

663
01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:29.669
Anthony Taylor: That's okay. And that's all right, Eastern. But here's another secret if you're on with specifically, if you're on windows.

664
01:00:29.810 --> 01:00:32.850
Anthony Taylor: if you type Anna, Thanda

665
01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:43.280
Anthony Taylor: Bra, or you'll see one that says prompt right here. if you open that one. and then type conduct

666
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:47.610
Anthony Taylor: desktest version, or VI guarantee you you'll get.

667
01:00:51.570 --> 01:00:57.909
Anthony Taylor: Is there a way to add that to your like path variable? We'll work on that. That's the office hours thing

668
01:00:58.210 --> 01:01:01.979
Anthony Taylor: it. It'll only take a second to. So don't even stress about it.

669
01:01:02.530 --> 01:01:04.199
Anthony Taylor: Christine. Everything working

670
01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:08.089
Anthony Taylor: awesome. Try to get Christine's 3. Door 4.

671
01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:09.690
Anthony Taylor: Brandon. What's up

672
01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:16.549
Mckimmy, Brandon: now? When I download it? Anecdot, it changed the icon on the ribbon to python.

673
01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:22.430
Mckimmy, Brandon: That's okay. So when I open it up is social.

674
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:31.399
Anthony Taylor: I guess. Show. I don't know what you're I'm not sure I'm following. So show me share your screen.

675
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:37.920
Mckimmy, Brandon: So right down here.

676
01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:54.039
Anthony Taylor: so wait. Don't go anywhere yet scroll down on the right.

677
01:01:56.500 --> 01:02:01.069
Anthony Taylor: I was hoping the Prompt would be there. Go to your windows, button, start typing Ana

678
01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:04.849
Anthony Taylor: windows. But

679
01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:11.729
Anthony Taylor: yeah, type, Anna, and stop.

680
01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:15.609
Anthony Taylor: Wait. There you go right there. C. Anaconda. Prompt.

681
01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:16.830
Anthony Taylor: Nope.

682
01:02:17.090 --> 01:02:18.760
Anthony Taylor: yep, click that

683
01:02:19.930 --> 01:02:27.669
Anthony Taylor: type. Conda version, Conda space desk desk group. We don't get in here very often, but we just want to make sure you have it installed.

684
01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:30.250
Anthony Taylor: What happened there.

685
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:32.339
Tania Raugewitz: that's the same error I get

686
01:02:32.490 --> 01:02:37.479
Mckimmy, Brandon: I already installed it before. So is that why not recognizing? Because I already did it?

687
01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:41.069
Dipinto, Matt: Oh, if you do a dash fully, type out version, it'll

688
01:02:41.530 --> 01:02:47.390
Anthony Taylor: oh, if you spell out version, okay, yeah. Do kind of things. Dash, dash version.

689
01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:52.480
Anthony Taylor: It didn't work for me, though. There you go. Thank you, Matt.

690
01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:58.820
Dipinto, Matt: I got a 2 page error report with my dash. Dash V. So I had to find something. Wow!

691
01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:00.420
Anthony Taylor: Don't ever do that again.

692
01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:06.840
Anthony Taylor: Alright! Anybody else. There's so much chat going on. I looked at it.

693
01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:07.829
See what's going on.

694
01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:16.819
sonja baro: is there? I mean not to be

695
01:03:17.010 --> 01:03:22.570
sonja baro: against using the terminal. But why wouldn't I just go to Anaconda and look at my version.

696
01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.590
Anthony Taylor: Well. because

697
01:03:29.170 --> 01:03:31.509
sonja baro: sorry. That's the reason.

698
01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:39.100
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So I gotcha, I'm with you. Here's the thing. How long did it take, and a kind of navigator to open

699
01:03:39.930 --> 01:03:44.889
sonja baro: nothing for me. It was super computer.

700
01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:51.260
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Well, if it happens, II mean, okay, II

701
01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:59.789
sonja baro: I'm just saying, too, because, like I had the same thing with the the V. It didn't work, and so I just said, All right, let me go check this other thing way out.

702
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:04.349
sonja baro:  so I don't get it. Remember.

703
01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:08.060
sonja baro: go ahead. You have to. You have to remember the boot camp rule.

704
01:04:08.830 --> 01:04:25.819
Anthony Taylor: Oh, show me the hardest way first. Yes, we show you the hardest way first, and then we show you the easy. So that way you're like the brain is fried. Hate me. You hate the class. Everything is awful. You're like mad when I go. Oh, what's this one click? Who you're like

705
01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:37.090
Anthony Taylor: recipe for security? So much time right? And you didn't even need to. That's the bad part. Didn't actually need to use all that time

706
01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:40.929
Anthony Taylor: if we would've just showed it to you first, Emily. However, you now appreciate easy.

707
01:04:43.310 --> 01:04:48.150
Anthony Taylor: I that's totally my theory. I don't know that any of that's true. But you are correct.

708
01:04:48.610 --> 01:04:52.230
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And, by the way, and a kind of prompt from here. Bang!

709
01:04:52.570 --> 01:04:53.530
Anthony Taylor: There it is.

710
01:04:54.730 --> 01:05:05.290
Anthony Taylor:  Truthfully. we won't bother with this much. Yes, somebody asked about us, code. even though you launch it from here, it's if it

711
01:05:05.350 --> 01:05:11.260
Anthony Taylor: it's probably don't think I think it doesn't install it. It's actually install. It's using yours.

712
01:05:11.970 --> 01:05:14.720
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So yes, you were best off installed.

713
01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:23.609
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it doesn't benefit you to necessarily use this. The only thing that kind of helps you with this is definitely connected to your comment.

714
01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:27.950
Anthony Taylor: And how do I know that? Well, if I launch it from here.

715
01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:31.550
Anthony Taylor: and then go Terminal and down here?

716
01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:34.999
Anthony Taylor: Oh, darn it, somebody else was right. And then I just

717
01:05:35.050 --> 01:05:39.690
Anthony Taylor: so if I launched it from here. Okay?

718
01:05:40.210 --> 01:05:43.550
Anthony Taylor: And then when I go in here, I can type conduct.

719
01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:45.759
Anthony Taylor: dash, dash version.

720
01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:49.400
Anthony Taylor: and I get it. So how did I get that new term?

721
01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:54.140
Anthony Taylor: So you have a terminal in Ds code? Also. all of you do.

722
01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:58.070
Anthony Taylor: Okay. You don't ever even have to open this term ever again.

723
01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:00.240
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

724
01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:02.800
Anthony Taylor: actually, I wanna check something.

725
01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.789
Anthony Taylor: So let's close that.

726
01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:08.190
Anthony Taylor: Let's open my Vs code from earlier

727
01:06:09.930 --> 01:06:12.960
Anthony Taylor: and open a terminal.

728
01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:16.979
Anthony Taylor: Let's see if I have it in here. And I do, I can tell.

729
01:06:18.790 --> 01:06:19.540
Anthony Taylor: Yep.

730
01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:23.709
Anthony Taylor: okay. So you have a terminal available to you in Vs code.

731
01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:25.330
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I didn't have to leave.

732
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:39.130
Anthony Taylor: and you can even change it if you prefer. Get bash. If you hit this little arrow right here. you can change it so that it defaults to get past. I would not do that unless you just really like

733
01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:41.390
Anthony Taylor: alright

734
01:06:44.890 --> 01:06:45.840
Anthony Taylor: questions.

735
01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:49.589
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So I oh, go ahead.

736
01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:54.439
Kanouff, Christine: Did you give us? What's the prompt to open anaconda from terminal.

737
01:06:55.420 --> 01:07:00.869
Anthony Taylor: from from Terminal? Well, you don't really open. You don't really open navigator from Terminal

738
01:07:00.930 --> 01:07:08.980
Anthony Taylor: you would just go to like your finder on your under back and just type, Anna, and look for the one with the green circle.

739
01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:15.529
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, there's no I mean, I'm sure there is. I don't know. I don't know. I there's no need to do that.

740
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:22.220
Anthony Taylor: What it was the pro prom promo to open conduct from the term. Oh, that's what you just asked me. Doug.

741
01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:27.970
Anthony Taylor: Conda spins up virtual Vs code. Do we install it alright? Did I catch everybody?

742
01:07:29.690 --> 01:07:34.400
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Alright. I love chat, and I don't actually watch it while we're involved.

743
01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:38.150
Anthony Taylor:  okay, so I'm actually gonna pause here.

744
01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:40.499
Anthony Taylor: because even though

745
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:45.600
Anthony Taylor:  even though

746
01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:51.589
Anthony Taylor: just happened. It says on the slides, look at Anaconda.

747
01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:56.179
Anthony Taylor: The lesson plan says we're gonna quickly go through our terminal commands again.

748
01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:59.349
Anthony Taylor: So I want to do that because I think it's a good idea.

749
01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:03.930
Anthony Taylor: And it's an activity. And you guys need activities. You can stop here and talk for a few minutes.

750
01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:13.039
Anthony Taylor:  okay? So you should have an activity from your gitlab today.

751
01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:19.770
Anthony Taylor: Activity number one student terminal refresher.

752
01:08:19.899 --> 01:08:24.969
Anthony Taylor: Just go through and do all this stuff in one of your terminals. Now, I've shown you how many terminals

753
01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:28.470
Anthony Taylor: the good news is. They are all the same terminal

754
01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:31.649
Anthony Taylor: just 3, 4 different ways to access them.

755
01:08:31.890 --> 01:08:45.220
Anthony Taylor: So pick the way you like. I would recommend VS. Code, because you're gonna be in VS. Code most of the time, anyway. But whatever one you like. Do all of this in your little groups. and come back and see me in 10 min.

756
01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:46.250
Anthony Taylor: Deal

757
01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:53.279
Anthony Taylor: welcome back, everybody!

758
01:08:53.290 --> 01:08:55.069
Anthony Taylor: How do we do? How we do how we do?

759
01:08:56.890 --> 01:08:59.389
Anthony Taylor: Oh, no, Natalie.

760
01:09:00.290 --> 01:09:04.230
Natalie Mason: we spent the whole time trying to find the instructions.

761
01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:07.709
Tania Raugewitz: Actually, I had the instructions, but we needed them from you.

762
01:09:08.939 --> 01:09:10.949
Anthony Taylor: Why did you need him for me?

763
01:09:12.279 --> 01:09:15.899
Anthony Taylor: No, the instructions are in your activity folder.

764
01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:20.009
Anthony Taylor: Everybody knows how to get their activity folder.

765
01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:23.590
Anthony Taylor: Do we need to go over that real quick.

766
01:09:23.609 --> 01:09:28.309
Anthony Taylor: Alright, that's what we'll do real fast. We're gonna go over that. Okay, this one's easy.

767
01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:34.099
Anthony Taylor: I can handle this. Why? So in canvas. Let me see my changes to student view.

768
01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:43.049
Anthony Taylor: There we go now I look now. It looks like the lookout. So under modules.

769
01:09:44.529 --> 01:09:52.850
Anthony Taylor: If you go to today's module, which is module 1, 2, or 3 sorry module, 1, 3.

770
01:09:52.970 --> 01:10:06.580
Anthony Taylor: You click that scroll to the bottom. Right there. Activity files. Yes, I want those. And then when you open now you'll see there's that first. This is the one you just did

771
01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:09.570
Anthony Taylor: just like that.

772
01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:15.430
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So that's one way to do it. Honestly, I think that's the easiest way to do it.

773
01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:19.699
Anthony Taylor: The other option is to actually go to get lab.

774
01:10:20.610 --> 01:10:24.380
Anthony Taylor: I don't know if I have it open right now. But basically, if you go to gitlab

775
01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:31.870
Anthony Taylor: there is, you can. You know, if you close that repository, you'll have all the activities that way as well.

776
01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:34.530
Clayton Graves: Honestly, that was probably the easiest way.

777
01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:42.730
Clayton Graves: I couldn't even get Anacana to work on Visual studio code. So I mean, I was wrestling. With that they?

778
01:10:42.810 --> 01:10:50.060
Clayton Graves: They were trying to figure out the instructions where the instructions were. Push that help, button! Nobody pushed the help.

779
01:10:51.870 --> 01:10:54.390
Anthony Taylor: Do you guys see the help. But when you're in breakout rooms

780
01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:57.229
Natalie Mason: I gotta push that help button

781
01:10:57.270 --> 01:11:06.660
Kevin Nguyen: with literally. We were all free to sit in there. Kevin and and James were having a great conversation about their days in college.

782
01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:17.370
Anthony Taylor: Right? We could have been in there helping you. They gotta push the help button guys. We don't know. You need help on a 10 min activity if you don't tell us.

783
01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:20.730
Anthony Taylor: Got it. But that's okay. We're good.

784
01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:23.510
Anthony Taylor: That's important. Yeah.

785
01:11:24.570 --> 01:11:26.309
michael mcpherson: My touch command didn't work.

786
01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:29.690
Anthony Taylor: That's really weird.

787
01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.289
Anthony Taylor: I don't even know what to say. That.

788
01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:46.329
Anthony Taylor: Why would that not work? We made it work recognized as an internal or external command windows command problem.

789
01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:48.219
Anthony Taylor: You have to use skip badge to do that.

790
01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:52.540
Masarirambi, Rodney: Yeah, unfortunately, had a great more touch.

791
01:11:53.370 --> 01:11:55.499
michael mcpherson: So what's what's a good workaround?

792
01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:58.860
Masarirambi, Rodney: I'm gonna let Curry do it, cause it was awesome.

793
01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:00.890
Anthony Taylor: Curry. What was the workaround?

794
01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:03.040
Curry Gardner: I just used them

795
01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:08.920
Curry Gardner: for that. Oh, instead of crazy tools.

796
01:12:10.150 --> 01:12:16.250
Anthony Taylor:  yeah, I mean, you could do it a lot of ways. Here, I wanna use this terminal right here.

797
01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:22.340
Anthony Taylor: Where am I right now? Am I in anything important?

798
01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:28.540
Anthony Taylor: So the instructions. says they say

799
01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:41.439

809
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:22.810
Anthony Taylor: we could. I mean, if you're using. Get bash or mac terminal, you could just do touch.

810
01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:28.540
Anthony Taylor: If you're not, you could just come up here and like, click on this folder and then do new file.

811
01:13:29.330 --> 01:13:33.290
Anthony Taylor: And in college breakfast

Anthony Taylor: is, you can actually come in here. Click on this guy. I need a new folder. We're gonna call this one lunch.

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:23.610
Anthony Taylor: Alright for this one. This seems like a long time.

849
01:16:24.490 --> 01:16:27.559
Anthony Taylor: Oh, you know what though it's break time. Huh? So how about this?

850
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:31.600
Anthony Taylor: Keep this in mind. Don't have your activity filed. Get them during break.

859
01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:17.430

860
01:17:19.730 --> 01:17:23.000
Anthony Taylor: Awesome? Okay. So for this.

861
01:17:23.890 --> 01:17:29.940
Anthony Taylor: see? I think 25 min is way too long for this. Here's what I'm gonna do.

862
01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:32.619
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to set it for 25 min.

863
01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:44.519
Anthony Taylor: And then if you guys get done early. I want you to come back to the main room. Welcome back alright! Who wants to share the screen? Show us what they're doing, what they did.

864
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:50.250
Masarirambi, Rodney: Brandon, you are the winner. But we can open.

865
01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:55.009
Anthony Taylor: Share your screen, sir.

866
01:17:56.040 --> 01:18:00.620
Anthony Taylor: Nice. So just walk us through step by step. What did you do?

867
01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:13.329
Anthony Taylor: It usually comes with audio. Oh, there you go. Okay, go ahead.

868
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:22.890
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, no. Just start like you made repo. What did you do?

869
01:18:25.410 --> 01:18:27.359
Mckimmy, Brandon: Did CD, I,

870
01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:30.459
Mckimmy, Brandon: Tilde? Cancer?

871
01:18:30.530 --> 01:18:34.430
Anthony Taylor: cool and show the list so showed everything on my

872
01:18:34.670 --> 01:18:36.330
Mckimmy, Brandon: windows. Explorer

873
01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:38.950
Mckimmy, Brandon: CE. Onedrive.

874
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:47.529
Mckimmy, Brandon: forward slash, and then list again to make sure what's there. And then once and then I went to this desktop after doing that.

875
01:18:47.670 --> 01:18:51.639
Mckimmy, Brandon: so I also followed all of this

876
01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:54.770
Anthony Taylor: with excellence.

877
01:18:55.130 --> 01:19:01.370
Mckimmy, Brandon: was again to make sure what I have previously had the dated class here. So I decided just to go back into that

878
01:19:01.930 --> 01:19:03.070
Anthony Taylor: good.

879
01:19:05.710 --> 01:19:08.429
Anthony Taylor: He had a oops get cloned, and then he nailed it.

880
01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:09.780
Mckimmy, Brandon: Yeah.

881
01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:20.819
Anthony Taylor: Well, couple of tries. Yeah, but you got there. I could see it keep going past. Had some issues, and then it finally copied correctly that silly copy paste

882
01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:23.659
Mckimmy, Brandon: so it can list again

883
01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:28.990
Mckimmy, Brandon: just showed this. So I wanted to get into this directory.

884
01:19:30.910 --> 01:19:36.300
Mckimmy, Brandon: Then list again. There's a lead. Me file went into that

885
01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:40.629
Mckimmy, Brandon: and then create a new directory, and I just call it new command

886
01:19:41.130 --> 01:19:51.360
Mckimmy, Brandon: was to get. And then oh, here's the problem. The reason why I did that to make 2 different folders. So I went ahead and removed that. and then we create a gentleman underscore.

887
01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:53.680
Anthony Taylor: How'd you remove the folder?

888
01:19:53.910 --> 01:20:00.390
Mckimmy, Brandon: But if you go down here you are, M. It doesn't have the dash bar, but the dashboard

889
01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:09.230
Anthony Taylor: help is necessary for a folder. Right? Rm, just reads a file. Rm, oh, there it is. Look a little further. See? You remove the directory

890
01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:12.899
Anthony Taylor: like 3 or 4 more.

891
01:20:13.090 --> 01:20:26.760
Mckimmy, Brandon: After that went back to the original spot list again. Make sure we got moved properly, and made the directory again with the underscore. After I did that I went in to see if it's there.

892
01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:30.900
Mckimmy, Brandon: and it showed over here that it was created.

893
01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:34.169
Mckimmy, Brandon: So then I did

894
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:39.250
Mckimmy, Brandon: create another empty file, so I just called it logbook

895
01:20:39.810 --> 01:20:44.859
Mckimmy, Brandon: list it to see if it's there. It's there. And then

896
01:20:45.930 --> 01:20:53.849
Mckimmy, Brandon: I get code. And when I did code, it automatically took me to Vs code. And then I type text to me when I did it.

897
01:20:56.410 --> 01:21:01.109
Anthony Taylor: I like it. You all done with that. Is that everything? Or is there more?

898
01:21:01.810 --> 01:21:06.479
Mckimmy, Brandon: Well, I did get status, and from my notes

899
01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:19.570
Mckimmy, Brandon: that is what's going on in repository. So this is what's showing right now, and it's show that I modified in the readme file. And then it's given me suggestions like, git add or git restore.

900
01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:21.529
Mckimmy, Brandon: So then I

901
01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:26.769
Mckimmy, Brandon:  so I'll just do an add function right

902
01:21:27.470 --> 01:21:32.589
Mckimmy, Brandon: might not be on here, but I did the.so it has everything it surges on

903
01:21:34.050 --> 01:21:42.960
Mckimmy, Brandon: and then get starts again. Okay? So it was modified since I added, the new file came there.

904
01:21:46.610 --> 01:21:47.940
Anthony Taylor: Excellent.

905
01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:57.029
Mckimmy, Brandon: Yeah. Type more texting after I went to. Had they committed by and set up, pushed it?

906
01:21:58.490 --> 01:22:00.129
Mckimmy, Brandon: What's the?

907
01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:04.880
Mckimmy, Brandon: I moved up one directory so I could

908
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.139
Mckimmy, Brandon: try to remove this new command to that.

909
01:22:09.170 --> 01:22:16.270
Mckimmy, Brandon: So then I did remove command line, so I had to get out of this new command first. So I moved to help director to go back to this one.

910
01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:20.060
Mckimmy, Brandon: and then I removed it because you can't remove it while you're in it.

911
01:22:21.730 --> 01:22:22.910
Mckimmy, Brandon: Can you approve?

912
01:22:24.410 --> 01:22:32.410
Mckimmy, Brandon: So I redid it because I put us here by an underscore it so that I redid it here and looped, and it's no longer showing on the site.

913
01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:42.810
Mckimmy, Brandon: And what's the garen. Make sure everything was good. and then I did the fat function again

914
01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:45.480
Anthony Taylor: to get it back and ready to commit.

915
01:22:46.890 --> 01:22:48.110
Anthony Taylor: Excellent!

916
01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:52.200
Anthony Taylor: I love that they have you guys do this so much with the command line?

917
01:22:52.950 --> 01:23:05.709
Anthony Taylor: And hopefully, this is the last time you will ever have to command line. Okay? Vs, code. We faster. Alright, but great job. Brandon showed us the command line. Thank you, sir.

918
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:12.920
Anthony Taylor: Great work. Very good. Any questions for me for Brandon. for anyone.

919
01:23:14.970 --> 01:23:17.569
Anthony Taylor: No, everybody was pretty good with that one.

920
01:23:17.670 --> 01:23:20.340
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I have a question for Brandon.

921
01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:34.010
Meredith McCanse (she/her): You were. I had a weird echo. Will you? I saw on your screen. You had the flight manual sort of list of all the different commands, and II remember looking at that, but I can't remember where to find it. Is it the

922
01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:36.029
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I know it's in Github.

923
01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:45.859
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Is it the key

924
01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:54.239

929
01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:14.550
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I don't know. That's what I'm asking. I think it was part of the

930
01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:18.350
Anthony Taylor: well, yeah, that's where I'm at right.

931

Anthony Taylor: And but where did you get that.

932
01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:25.359
Anthony Taylor: Did you get that from my stuff, or did you

933

01:24:45.630 --> 01:24:52.180
Anthony Taylor: that way. You don't have to worry about sharing a whole bunch of stuff, mister. Oh, look what what Matt

936
01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:58.760
Anthony Taylor: Matt is I like is going to be my official helper.

937
01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:01.359
Anthony Taylor: That was awesome.

938
01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:04.119
Dipinto, Matt: Okay, the yeah. URL guy.

939
01:25:04.830 --> 01:25:14.560
Anthony Taylor: There you go? Can you paste that URL map? We're gonna do that to Van now, every time we have a URL. That's fantastic. alright

940
01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:19.600
Anthony Taylor: questions. any more questions.

941
01:25:20.110 --> 01:25:24.219
Anthony Taylor: There's a lot of good stuff in that flight.

942
01:25:25.190 --> 01:25:26.210
Anthony Taylor: What about it?

943
01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:29.549
michael mcpherson: Where? How did we get to your repository again?

944
01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:31.660
Anthony Taylor: I put it in the chat.

945
01:25:34.150 --> 01:25:40.030
Anthony Taylor: Alright, zoom chat that'll take you to the flight manual or the classroom, nor I'm stuck.

946
01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:45.040
Anthony Taylor: It's been posted a lot, and everyone should have already read it

947
01:25:45.870 --> 01:25:47.440
Anthony Taylor: at least twice

948
01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:53.540
michael mcpherson: I did. But oh, look bookmark on my!

949
01:25:56.350 --> 01:26:04.009
Anthony Taylor: It's good stuff it really is. The whole idea of it is to make your life your and make your less worried about coming to cloud.

950
01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:06.160
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

951
01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:10.600
Kanouff, Christine: I have a a question. So

952
01:26:10.890 --> 01:26:15.419
Kanouff, Christine: so I have this. Now I have a couple repositories on my desktop.

953
01:26:16.410 --> 01:26:22.589
Kanouff, Christine: Let's say I kind of forget what they are, and I start moving them around like I add them into a different file.

954
01:26:22.830 --> 01:26:24.310
Kanouff, Christine: Is that okay?

955
01:26:24.630 --> 01:26:25.500
Anthony Taylor: So

956
01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:29.090
Kanouff, Christine: so let me show you

957
01:26:31.090 --> 01:26:34.179
Anthony Taylor: if I like. I have lots of repositories.

958
01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:40.609
Anthony Taylor: so I don't know Berto project. So no, that's part.

959
01:26:40.910 --> 01:26:47.010
Anthony Taylor:  Here we go. For some reason, not showing

960
01:26:48.650 --> 01:26:50.180
Anthony Taylor: in items again.

961
01:26:51.670 --> 01:26:55.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay, well, that's not a problem that's not. That's like, not.

962
01:26:55.990 --> 01:27:01.649
sonja baro: thank you. Why wasn't that git? Because it didn't say, get. And you didn't have a holder.

963
01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:05.760
Anthony Taylor: It didn't have a dot git couldn't be to get

964
01:27:05.810 --> 01:27:07.570
sonja baro: yeah,

965
01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:17.960
Anthony Taylor: this one could have been. This is, there's so much cool stuff in here that you guys could learn from. And you will. I'm gonna give it all you at some point.

966
01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:20.540
Anthony Taylor: But I wanna find

967
01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:24.019
Anthony Taylor: there we go.

968
01:27:24.220 --> 01:27:30.770
Anthony Taylor: So here's the problem with that or with, if you do that, Christine, this get folder

969
01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:34.260
Anthony Taylor: is basically watching everything in here.

970
01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:37.300
Kanouff, Christine: Okay? And if you make a change

971
01:27:37.670 --> 01:27:52.750
Anthony Taylor: inside of here, there's a little paper database that keeps track of that chain. Now, if I go grab another it folder and put it in here. And I change something in it. This, it is going to try to watch both all of it.

972
01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:59.360
Anthony Taylor: And it's gonna cause a horrible mess. Okay, it basically just makes both get repositories broken.

973
01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:00.440
Kanouff, Christine: Okay.

974
01:28:00.730 --> 01:28:04.129
Anthony Taylor: alright. So don't do that.

975
01:28:04.390 --> 01:28:18.079
Anthony Taylor: Go ahead. What I do is I have. II have like a pro like for you guys, you guys, your dated class folder, though now you can move the whole. Get into a folder. That is not a reboot.

976
01:28:18.130 --> 01:28:21.700
Anthony Taylor: That's fine. Just never put a repo in a repo.

977
01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:28.289
Kanouff, Christine: That's the only rule you need to remember. But III suggest you guys make like a data class folder.

978
01:28:28.410 --> 01:28:30.330
Anthony Taylor: And then

979
01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:39.210
Anthony Taylor: yeah, and then just do just clone everything into it whenever you're using it, and you'll have all these folders in it, and it'll be great, even your homeworks.

980
01:28:39.430 --> 01:28:44.070
Kanouff, Christine: Okay? And can I? If I need to clean things up, can I delete

981
01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:48.629
Kanouff, Christine: repository? You can delete you can just delete them. Yeah. Github, okay.

982
01:28:49.030 --> 01:28:53.540
Anthony Taylor: yeah, yeah. You can even go on. Get out and clean up. I need to do that because mine's getting a little busy.

983
01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:55.689
Kanouff, Christine: Yeah, with lots of dam boobs.

984
01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:57.470
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

985
01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:02.650
Anthony Taylor: alright. Any other questions on that? That's a great question.

986
01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:11.620
Anthony Taylor: I like it. When you guys ask questions like that cause it means alright, right? Right? You're hearing me. And they and they just they just need some guidance. Love that

987
01:29:12.010 --> 01:29:15.590
Anthony Taylor: go ahead. Next topics.

988
01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:17.990
Anthony Taylor: documentation.

989
01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:23.700
Anthony Taylor: Matt. as a technical lead

990
01:29:23.890 --> 01:29:27.430
Anthony Taylor: is probably very familiar with documentation.

991
01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:33.569
Anthony Taylor: Yes, Matt, you can just not. It's not true, so familiar. And I hate Iso.

992
01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:47.169
Anthony Taylor: There we go. documentation, and we've got lots of like scholarly types of years. So we got lots of documentaries, right? So here's the thing. Good documentation when it comes to programming

993
01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:53.720
Anthony Taylor: Or AI, or whether it be AI or Python L, or data engineering

994
01:29:53.870 --> 01:29:57.910
Anthony Taylor: anything. Okay? Good

995
01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:06.110
Anthony Taylor: documentation is documentation. That explains what you have, what they're there to see? And we're talking about

996
01:30:09.170 --> 01:30:11.929
Anthony Taylor: the read me right now. Brian doesn't

997
01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:20.549
Anthony Taylor: think I have a repeat. Yeah, my, read me here is actually the the content. Okay, doesn't really tell a whole lot, but it has all these sections.

998
01:30:21.070 --> 01:30:23.130
Anthony Taylor: Okay,

999
01:30:23.420 --> 01:30:27.280
Anthony Taylor: and if you look at my other ones, I am not a big

1000
01:30:27.290 --> 01:30:33.650
Anthony Taylor: hey? Let's put out some documentation in here. I know that's not at work. That's a documentation.

1001
01:30:34.090 --> 01:30:37.089
Anthony Taylor:  me show you.

1002
01:30:38.330 --> 01:30:44.539
Anthony Taylor: I usually try to put at least something in there for you. I really want to find one of my favorites.

1003
01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:49.480
Anthony Taylor: I don't think that one has anything in it. Listen.

1004
01:30:51.040 --> 01:31:01.620
Anthony Taylor: now, see, those are my documentation. Really good stuff. A lot of times. I also put documentation in like slideshows and not in the

1005
01:31:02.530 --> 01:31:04.709
Anthony Taylor: the main thing, is it?

1006
01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:07.410
Anthony Taylor: Now? Anyway.

1007
01:31:07.570 --> 01:31:12.100
Anthony Taylor: I was gonna show you some good documentation, anyway, from give you a link.

1008
01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:20.760
Anthony Taylor: They want me to tell you a story about bad documentation. You want a story about bad documentation. Here's the story. It stinks.

1009
01:31:21.890 --> 01:31:31.860
Anthony Taylor: That's it, right? It's awful when you're trying to to develop something. And there's the documentation of what you need to develop the requirements

1010
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:36.130
Anthony Taylor: or the BRD business requirements. Document.

1011
01:31:36.250 --> 01:31:38.319
Anthony Taylor: If it's not good.

1012
01:31:39.180 --> 01:31:40.290
Anthony Taylor: it's not good.

1013
01:31:40.900 --> 01:31:48.959
Anthony Taylor: Mean, you're gonna run. You're gonna be slow. You're going to develop stuff they didn't want, not develop stuff they did want.

1014
01:31:49.050 --> 01:31:53.090
Anthony Taylor: There's all kinds of issues. How do we solve it? Well, we

1015
01:31:54.330 --> 01:31:56.809
Anthony Taylor: do as you're told, not as just done as I do

1016
01:31:57.130 --> 01:32:01.229
Anthony Taylor: are going to make better documentation than Anthrax.

1017
01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:04.639
Anthony Taylor: That's our goal. Okay. Now, again.

1018
01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:11.859
Anthony Taylor: I write huge documents as a consultant for a really long time. And I love writing documents because I get paid by the hour.

1019
01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:13.700
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1020
01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:20.659
Anthony Taylor:  we are going to write. Documentation is not necessarily verbose, but it is at least

1021
01:32:22.230 --> 01:32:28.940
Anthony Taylor: accurate, and it does the job. So good documentation includes the following.

1022
01:32:30.270 --> 01:32:37.629
Anthony Taylor: the structure of an application, if you have an application. And you can see, this is just like I can send you guys like.

1023
01:32:37.950 --> 01:32:39.350
Anthony Taylor: send you guys this.

1024
01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:42.319
Anthony Taylor: I'll put it in zoom chat. This is not.

1025
01:32:43.590 --> 01:32:54.830
Anthony Taylor: It's just an example of some good documentation. Okay, so this has, like a good name. It tells you exactly what was what this app does.

1026
01:32:55.290 --> 01:32:59.520
Anthony Taylor: gives you some cool little visuals. Okay.

1027
01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:07.960
Anthony Taylor:  it has, like all of this different information about the application, the config file, how to install it

1028
01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:11.180
Anthony Taylor: with links to how to install.

1029
01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:15.360
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And you guys do not need to install this.

1030
01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:19.190
Anthony Taylor: It. It's one of those things where I mean, you could. But

1031
01:33:20.050 --> 01:33:20.820
no.

1032
01:33:21.170 --> 01:33:28.990
Anthony Taylor: I I've never used this. I've never used this particular thing, and it's there's nothing wrong with it. It's it's fine. You just don't need it, because you have anacom.

1033
01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:35.100
Anthony Taylor: More documentation. Here's this is documentation that leads you to work.

1034
01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:38.680
Anthony Taylor: That's important. Yes, I

1035
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:48.839
sonja baro: so a readme file does it. I I've always seen read me file as a ta dot txt.

1036
01:33:49.920 --> 01:34:04.960
sonja baro: But this is yeah, like, so so what's where I'm wondering is the read me file. It's like a shell, and you can put whatever goes into that to help explain whatever it is that you're explaining. Cause

1037
01:34:04.970 --> 01:34:07.340
Anthony Taylor: it's it's a language called Mark down

1038
01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:12.060
sonja baro: Markdown. Okay, Mark, that's what that nd stands for.

1039
01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:17.090
Anthony Taylor: Markdown is kind of a variation of of

1040
01:34:17.670 --> 01:34:19.200
Anthony Taylor: HTML.

1041
01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:22.960
sonja baro: Now the good news is, you can open word

1042
01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:27.349
Anthony Taylor: it's opening on my other screen.

1043
01:34:27.890 --> 01:34:33.480
Anthony Taylor: What is that? Oh, that's so funny! It an auto recovered document.

1044
01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:37.230
Anthony Taylor: And it's funny. Hopefully, it's not bad.

1045
01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:44.410
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. We were looking at things to put on coffee cups or coasters, I think. anyway.

1046
01:34:44.520 --> 01:35:05.579
Anthony Taylor: title, and then

1047
01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:07.539
Anthony Taylor: you can save it

1048
01:35:08.580 --> 01:35:16.260
Anthony Taylor: as I should copy. Here. It's Markdown is what we the word MDMD. O, no.

1049
01:35:16.370 --> 01:35:23.549
sonja baro: no, you you you can't. Well, I know you can open them in here, and it'll read it, but

1050
01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:28.739
Anthony Taylor: I would assure you, could save it, too, in here you can save it as HTML, which would work

1051
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.559
Anthony Taylor: right so you could as well.

1052
01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:40.659
sonja baro: You could do like, for instance, the upcoming challenge that we have. We could do all that. Do it. In a word, Doc.

1053
01:35:40.970 --> 01:35:46.710
sonja baro: upload it into the repository as if it's a readme, yeah.

1054
01:35:48.030 --> 01:35:51.409
Anthony Taylor: save a doc. Yes, you can.

1055
01:35:51.600 --> 01:36:02.070
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. I mean, it's pretty cool. Ii have to write a lot of documentation in that.

1056
01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:06.740
Anthony Taylor: There's even a look at that. There's a python program that will do it.

1057
01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:08.259
sonja baro: Okay? And that's

1058
01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:13.370
Anthony Taylor: here. But if you blah blah

1059
01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:19.990
Anthony Taylor:  yeah, can I do it? In word.

1060
01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:26.720
sonja baro: Yeah, right there, this is a chat. Gbt, this is big chat. By the way, you guys in those

1061
01:36:26.890 --> 01:36:29.949
Anthony Taylor: they renamed it. It's now called co-pilot.

1062
01:36:31.100 --> 01:36:39.749
Anthony Taylor: There you go.md. At the end of the name. Click, save? Well, that shouldn't do it honestly.

1063
01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:43.060
Anthony Taylor: but you never know save as plain text

1064
01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:47.660
Anthony Taylor: click on save save text text editors such as notepad

1065
01:36:47.810 --> 01:36:53.299
Anthony Taylor: copy the contents. Your clipboard paste contents into a new okay, that is not the same thing.

1066
01:36:54.050 --> 01:36:55.660
Anthony Taylor: Alright, and I'll show you why.

1067
01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:02.500
Anthony Taylor: let's go to one of my repositories.

1068
01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:12.550
Anthony Taylor: and we'll just play around with the review a little bit here. So here's the readme. So if I edit this markdown. This is what it looks like.

1069
01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:16.109
Anthony Taylor: So if I want to make like

1070
01:37:17.290 --> 01:37:19.410
Anthony Taylor: like, emphasize something

1071
01:37:20.850 --> 01:37:21.670
so

1072
01:37:22.210 --> 01:37:26.250
Anthony Taylor: and preview, we can preview it so we can see what that did.

1073
01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:30.899
Anthony Taylor: Okay, actually, that did nothing. Why did that did nothing? Oh, gotta have a space.

1074
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:40.229
Anthony Taylor: It's kind of particular about things like that. So that made it just a little bit more bold. Okay, this one. What it did it made it, giant.

1075
01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:47.509
Anthony Taylor: There's this, and and there's a lot of like HTML stuff you can plug in here so we could say something like.

1076
01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:52.329
Anthony Taylor: Did I put an HTML tag like this.

1077
01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:54.819
Anthony Taylor: and then say, Bob.

1078
01:37:55.140 --> 01:38:00.580
Anthony Taylor: and preview that and all that did was it put a lot. Actually, let's make it a Hr

1079
01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:16.600
Anthony Taylor: there. Hr is horizontal line. So I put a horizontal line here. Okay, so there's whole bunches of stuff. I don't think it's in my flight manual, because we don't usually spend a lot of time on top about the review.

1080
01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:20.219
Anthony Taylor: If you want it to be formatted nice, you're gonna want to find

1081
01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:27.340
Anthony Taylor: like Pan, Dot, or something, and just, you know, learn how to do it. The good news is you don't have to do tons of it.

1082
01:38:28.050 --> 01:38:32.869
Anthony Taylor: I mean, we do. I do mostly for school.

1083
01:38:33.450 --> 01:38:35.040
Anthony Taylor: Okay for you guys.

1084
01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:38.829
Anthony Taylor: Our entire lesson plan is written in market.

1085
01:38:39.860 --> 01:38:47.580
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So when we write like I wrote, you know. one of the big lesson plans in the data one and and I had to do the.

1086
01:38:50.020 --> 01:38:51.450
Anthony Taylor: But it's okay.

1087
01:38:51.770 --> 01:38:55.460
Anthony Taylor: So what's included in good? Read me. Let's let's go back to where we were.

1088
01:38:57.260 --> 01:39:00.669
Anthony Taylor: I don't know where we were at that poetry place. I don't know if I still have that.

1089
01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:02.060
Anthony Taylor: Let's see.

1090
01:39:02.630 --> 01:39:05.630
Anthony Taylor: Cancel.

1091
01:39:06.110 --> 01:39:07.429
sonja baro: It's in the chat.

1092
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.700
Anthony Taylor: He won't let me out.

1093
01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:17.360
Anthony Taylor: That's alright. Get out of there, holy Moly! It left that open, too. Don't say okay. Here we go.

1094
01:39:18.370 --> 01:39:27.380
Anthony Taylor: So anyway, all what's important about your documentation is it explains what you have. what it can do. how to use it.

1095
01:39:28.010 --> 01:39:34.400
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And if there are any like examples or anything like that, that paste in there, that's what you want to do.

1096
01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:44.120
Anthony Taylor: Why is this important? Why am I telling? We're really early week, one by week, 24. You're going to have

1097
01:39:44.150 --> 01:39:48.150
Anthony Taylor: numerous projects, numerous things

1098
01:39:48.910 --> 01:39:55.540
Anthony Taylor: that you're working on. It's our half worked out. And I want you to have this greetings set up.

1099
01:39:56.450 --> 01:39:59.339
Anthony Taylor: Okay, because on your

1100
01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:01.870
Anthony Taylor: linkedin or your

1101
01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:08.980
Anthony Taylor: your your Cvs, your resume whatever you're going to point people to your Github Repository.

1102
01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:19.800
Anthony Taylor: and they're gonna come. And you want that to look nice so that they know what you did. And all of that. Here's the thing that has been universally spoken

1103
01:40:19.890 --> 01:40:24.809
Anthony Taylor: about students from this boot camp. Well, not the AI. One. This is the first one.

1104
01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:28.869
Anthony Taylor: But from the data of Boot Camp when they went to interview

1105
01:40:29.020 --> 01:40:33.249
Anthony Taylor: oh, my God! You learn that much in 6 months.

1106
01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:39.609
Anthony Taylor: That's always the first thing that comes out of people's minds. And then there's the you didn't really learn that.

1107
01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:44.779
Anthony Taylor: And then they start looking at the project. So like, Oh, my God, they're in that budget 6 months.

1108
01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:47.950
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then when they interview

1109
01:40:48.030 --> 01:40:50.789
Anthony Taylor: oh, my God! Anyway!

1110
01:40:51.230 --> 01:40:54.450
Anthony Taylor: That's gonna be, you guys in new time at all.

1111
01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:57.630
Anthony Taylor: Oh.

1112
01:41:01.170 --> 01:41:02.000
Anthony Taylor: okay.

1113
01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:06.020
Anthony Taylor: so there is an activity.

1114
01:41:09.610 --> 01:41:12.400
Anthony Taylor: It's activity. 3. Let's see.

1115
01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:24.010
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, this is a pretty cool one. So it has a page. It wants you to go to

1116
01:41:24.150 --> 01:41:33.340
Anthony Taylor:  and or you go to. Well, you go to the trending page, pick a repository, pick something that interests your team.

1117
01:41:33.690 --> 01:41:35.039
Anthony Taylor: Talk about it

1118
01:41:36.850 --> 01:41:44.130
Anthony Taylor: after you discussed with the readme file. Pick a second and do that, too. Okay, that's a pretty easy

1119
01:41:44.730 --> 01:41:50.059
Anthony Taylor: 15 min, and that'll put us right at the end of calls.

1120
01:41:51.020 --> 01:41:55.129
Anthony Taylor: Well, let's make that 10 min, I think Ken is plunking, don't you?

1121
01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:56.090
Anthony Taylor: You, too?

1122
01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:00.910
Anthony Taylor: Let's do 10, cause we do have one more thing I wanna do before you guys leave.

1123
01:42:02.050 --> 01:42:03.010
Tania Raugewitz: Okay.

1124
01:42:05.540 --> 01:42:06.900
Anthony Taylor: welcome back.

1125
01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:09.759
michael mcpherson: Were you supposed to write anything down?

1126
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:14.000
Anthony Taylor: No. however, I'm gonna put somebody on the hot seat

1127
01:42:14.380 --> 01:42:19.240
Anthony Taylor: Ronnie Ronnie

1128
01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:23.599
Anthony Taylor: Rodney, you're on the hot seat. Tell us what you guys talked about.

1129
01:42:23.950 --> 01:42:30.039
Masarirambi, Rodney: So we I'm gonna share this because I thought this was.

1130
01:42:30.850 --> 01:42:50.230
Masarirambi, Rodney: Yeah, no worries, no worries. So we looked at this one, which is the Italian loved like the use of colors and the visualization. You know, having all the links up there. But the one thing that we and we discovered as we went through this is that

1131
01:42:50.390 --> 01:42:59.869
Masarirambi, Rodney: whoever? Well, the person created it's like went into a lot of detail like explaining and putting a lot of information as to present you what you're about to see

1132
01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:08.870
Masarirambi, Rodney: and you know, as you go through it, there's like multiple examples. There's there's explainers. There's

1133
01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:24.669
Masarirambi, Rodney: it it it one thing that we felt like often like looking at. 3 or 4 of these was. if this person wants to, if you if you were to, if we were to set somebody and say, Go ahead and install this using their documentation like

1134
01:43:25.090 --> 01:43:38.219
Masarirambi, Rodney: it. We we felt like you'll be very confident that we wouldn't need to hit something that wasn't explained or wasn't expected. But a couple of them, whilst they were like, you know, really well done. Were, you know.

1135
01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:43.890
Masarirambi, Rodney: kind of kind of felt like something obvious, my meeting list. But even like just expanding this on this section.

1136
01:43:44.270 --> 01:43:50.940
Masarirambi, Rodney: like, there's like a whole load of like information which is put in there. And I don't even think that's the longest one

1137
01:43:50.980 --> 01:44:02.780
Masarirambi, Rodney: and then even going through to the to the to the installation like and and what libraries gonna be used? what's going to be like included right over there? It it was just

1138
01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:12.599
Anthony Taylor: really well done. And it was the first one we saw, and we thought that it we thought it kind of felt a little worried start, and then we looked.

1139
01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:13.570
Masarirambi, Rodney: No.

1140
01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:17.420
Anthony Taylor: I love that I love that Rodney. That is awesome.

1141
01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:22.710
Anthony Taylor: That was a good good good find. That picture behind you is fantastic.

1142
01:44:23.170 --> 01:44:26.660
Anthony Taylor:  awesome bye.

1143
01:44:27.070 --> 01:44:32.049
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, we have time, for like a 1 min. Anybody got one in 1 min. They want to tell me.

1144
01:44:32.070 --> 01:44:34.599
Anthony Taylor: Cindy, I haven't heard from you all day.

1145
01:44:34.750 --> 01:44:36.470
Anthony Taylor: like she's like. No.

1146
01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:37.940
no!

1147
01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:48.289
Sihong Zhou: Michael, just to send the the one we discussed, which is awesome economics, and I think he really liked it.

1148
01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:51.849
Sihong Zhou: Hmm! But to me, I think.

1149
01:44:52.920 --> 01:45:00.770
Sihong Zhou: Ca, can I show you what? Yeah, of course. Yeah, let me share my screen. So should it be this one.

1150
01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:03.080
Sihong Zhou: And

1151
01:45:05.010 --> 01:45:29.949
Sihong Zhou: so the first thing I don't like is kind of like this color, because whenever I see such kind of a color, I just kind of think it's a scam, so I'll never click it. This is the first thing. I don't like it. And Michael think this is very kind of a comprehensive knowledge include everything.

1152
01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:55.440
Sihong Zhou: everything. He wants. Yeah, that's a lot. But I think there's one question from this note is, does it provide too much information? I think it to me to provide it too much cause I want to. Kind of learning something gradually, just a little by little. And

1153
01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:58.989
Sihong Zhou: I think there's one topic

1154
01:45:59.190 --> 01:46:02.570
Sihong Zhou: we find which is economics.

1155
01:46:03.450 --> 01:46:09.990
Sihong Zhou: No makes kind of like this. And I think

1156
01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:32.639
Sihong Zhou: this is very comprehensive. But like, I said, II want economics to be like Macco economics, microeconomics and the topics from Fedex, the news and stock kind of information, or I want it to be divided by very

1157
01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:45.289
Sihong Zhou: small topics. But to me this is too broad and comprehensive. I kind of think it's too much information to me.

1158
01:46:45.590 --> 01:46:52.630
Sihong Zhou: but I don't know what. Why cause think about it.

1159
01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:55.389
Anthony Taylor: I only asked you, so you're okay.

1160
01:46:55.650 --> 01:47:05.039
Sihong Zhou: Yeah. And we didn't have enough time to find another file to compare. So we didn't find a very kind of the one

1161
01:47:05.090 --> 01:47:10.140
Sihong Zhou: we like the best. Not for this time, maybe. Next time. Yeah.

1162
01:47:10.830 --> 01:47:18.820
Anthony Taylor: alright. Well, cool, excellent work. Alright. Well, that's good. That was fun. Then that actually turned out to be pretty fun.

1163
01:47:19.050 --> 01:47:22.040
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so the last thing we're gonna talk about today.

1164
01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:32.900
Anthony Taylor: And and I hate to leave you guys with this, because this is one of those things that's really, really cool. It's good to know I will have you use it occasionally.

1165
01:47:32.980 --> 01:47:37.660
Anthony Taylor: But I don't want you to stress. You're not even gonna do this in an activity. I'm just gonna show it to you.

1166
01:47:37.710 --> 01:47:45.170
Anthony Taylor: I want you to remember there is such a thing. and then don't worry about it until I bring it up again. Been up like 6 weeks.

1167
01:47:45.690 --> 01:47:48.679
Anthony Taylor: Okay, let me share my screen.

1168
01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:56.600
Anthony Taylor: Why am I embarrassed? Okay, was I already sharing my screen?

1169
01:47:57.280 --> 01:47:58.530
Anthony Taylor: Now I'm sharing my screen.

1170
01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:00.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So

1171
01:48:01.130 --> 01:48:05.619
Anthony Taylor: we have this thing called virtual environments.

1172
01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:12.629
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So if if I was to like, if we go to anaconda and there's this environment thing here.

1173
01:48:12.850 --> 01:48:15.990
Anthony Taylor: we can come in here we can click one of these.

1174
01:48:18.750 --> 01:48:25.589
Anthony Taylor: It's gonna take forever every single time I click it, you watch and it'll show us. That's not too bad, so it'll show us

1175
01:48:25.650 --> 01:48:33.370
Anthony Taylor: what libraries we've installed. Now, you guys don't even know what libraries are yet. but you will soon

1176
01:48:33.530 --> 01:48:38.439
Anthony Taylor: okay. And this allows us to say, Hey.

1177
01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:49.549
Anthony Taylor: I want to create a little space. We're only the libraries I need. Libraries are going to be like programs. We could use to code with only the ones I need

1178
01:48:50.140 --> 01:48:51.550
Anthony Taylor: are available to.

1179
01:48:52.450 --> 01:48:59.939
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I'm not a huge fan of this tech, this this method, but it is important in some development situations.

1180
01:49:00.230 --> 01:49:03.969
Anthony Taylor: My base, as you'll see here, has, like

1181
01:49:04.110 --> 01:49:06.049
Anthony Taylor: hundreds of libraries.

1182
01:49:06.870 --> 01:49:10.620
Anthony Taylor: I'm like. it's it takes up a little extra memory I can live with.

1183
01:49:11.230 --> 01:49:26.699
Anthony Taylor:  So there are 2 ways. I'm gonna start one of those ways. Now. it's there's Conda update, or you would have to update your condo. All of you just installed it. So I'm not too worried about that

1184
01:49:27.050 --> 01:49:32.390
Anthony Taylor:  But to install the environment.

1185
01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:35.900
Anthony Taylor: you would to create a new environment. You would do, condo.

1186
01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:40.039
Anthony Taylor: and don't worry. You'll get this. Create dash in.

1187
01:49:40.180 --> 01:49:42.680
Anthony Taylor: You're given a name, a name.

1188
01:49:42.780 --> 01:49:44.230
Anthony Taylor: whatever name you like.

1189
01:49:44.470 --> 01:49:52.289
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Then we would tell it what version of Python. So this is why they why the the curriculum wants you to do this

1190
01:49:52.460 --> 01:50:02.690
Anthony Taylor: is because the version of Python goes up and things change. So the code that's in the curriculum. It was tested with version 3.1

1191
01:50:03.210 --> 01:50:05.580
Anthony Taylor: alright. But here's the way I hand it.

1192
01:50:06.230 --> 01:50:12.610
Anthony Taylor: If I'm checking out the the lesson plan for the day. And we're in version 3

1193
01:50:12.710 --> 01:50:18.210
Anthony Taylor: of Python. And it doesn't work. I fix the code and show you how I did.

1194
01:50:18.700 --> 01:50:21.070
Anthony Taylor: because that's what you would have to do at work.

1195
01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:30.390
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but still cool to know how to do this, where there are situations where I will ask you to do this, but only an extra review.

1196
01:50:31.170 --> 01:50:38.580
Anthony Taylor: So there's the command. I'm gonna kick it off here. It takes like 3 or 4 min. So we're gonna let that one go

1197
01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:42.480
Anthony Taylor: all right. And just it's just gonna go. Okay.

1198
01:50:42.620 --> 01:50:52.879
Anthony Taylor: you do have to have right access to wherever your anaconda is stored. So you might have to log into this admin or something to make that work. Another way to do it

1199
01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:54.880
Anthony Taylor: for anaconda

1200
01:50:54.990 --> 01:50:58.030
Anthony Taylor: is you can come in here, hit, create.

1201
01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:02.029
Anthony Taylor: Remember the easy way. and we're gonna do it the easy way

1202
01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:05.630
Tania Raugewitz: we can even tell it which packages to install.

1203
01:51:06.650 --> 01:51:07.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1204
01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:10.060
Anthony Taylor: if it lets me come on.

1205
01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:14.150
Anthony Taylor: No, there it goes.

1206
01:51:14.730 --> 01:51:18.989
Anthony Taylor: So we can say, install. I'm I've got 3.1 2 on

1207
01:51:19.670 --> 01:51:22.139
Anthony Taylor: okay. And then we can do create.

1208
01:51:22.830 --> 01:51:33.420
Anthony Taylor: And it's just going to create in here. Okay, now, the one that we're creating out here that's gonna take forever to finish it will also show up in here.

1209
01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:37.420
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Now, how do we use them? Well.

1210
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:42.909
Anthony Taylor: in the command? Prompt, you would say, activate. And if it gets done anytime soon, I'll show you

1211
01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:47.100
Anthony Taylor:  in here, we can just select it.

1212
01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:51.509
Anthony Taylor: But the important part since, remember, we're going to always use Vs code.

1213
01:51:51.690 --> 01:51:54.839
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we need to know how to get to it in here.

1214
01:51:54.880 --> 01:52:08.220
Anthony Taylor: So one of the ways we're going to be doing things. Starting next week is with. Get out of the screen. A notebook. This is a notebook. Okay?

1215
01:52:08.830 --> 01:52:14.260
Anthony Taylor: And with this notebook over here, it says, select kernel. A kernel

1216
01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:20.899
Anthony Taylor: is python. What version of python do you want to use? So we're going to click that

1217
01:52:20.990 --> 01:52:25.519
Anthony Taylor: it's gonna say, what environment? And then we could come in here and select our environment.

1218
01:52:26.730 --> 01:52:28.109
Anthony Taylor: the one we just made.

1219
01:52:28.120 --> 01:52:35.430
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now, both of them are still being made. That's why you don't see them. That one's still being made. What about that? This one

1220
01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:42.280
Anthony Taylor: this one's there? This one came in way faster. So if we refresh this.

1221
01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:45.470
Anthony Taylor: should.

1222
01:52:48.090 --> 01:53:00.179
Anthony Taylor: you can also create an environment from here, too. By the way. it takes a second, it will get here eventually. Let's see if I completely leave this area. Come back.

1223
01:53:01.510 --> 01:53:10.989
Anthony Taylor: Does it come with libraries, or just empty it it it well depends on what you add to it. So this one comes with these libraries.

1224
01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:22.409
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so what you would do. And now you would have to go in and everything you want to run, you'd have to install the library. So I have since done this before the rest of you. You'll understand what that means next week.

1225
01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:26.329
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But

1226
01:53:26.520 --> 01:53:30.349
Anthony Taylor: yeah. So anyway. So now you can see it's in the easy way.

1227
01:53:30.660 --> 01:53:38.209
Anthony Taylor: It's it's no big deal. Honestly, guys. I will most the time. Tell you to just use

1228
01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:42.710
Anthony Taylor: base this guy right here one. Suzanne found the 3.

1229
01:53:43.010 --> 01:53:48.280
Anthony Taylor: Just use that. Okay. But now you know how. Yes, I.

1230
01:53:49.080 --> 01:54:01.810
sonja baro: So for the I'm a non coder. So I almost need to take a step up with this. So we use anaconda to create a virtual environment.

1231
01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:07.719
sonja baro: Virtual environment is a place where we do coding.

1232
01:54:08.410 --> 01:54:17.269
sonja baro: Is that right? Or tha, that's yeah. It's hard to explain. So the fact that they put this in here before you even know what python is.

1233
01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:24.010
Anthony Taylor: Right? This is a little fact. Okay? And I'm actually gonna mention that to them when I talk to them.

1234
01:54:24.710 --> 01:54:27.919
Anthony Taylor: So these little, these words here.

1235
01:54:27.970 --> 01:54:31.969
sonja baro: these are libraries that you're Gonna use to program with python.

1236
01:54:32.290 --> 01:54:38.489
Anthony Taylor: And like, say, you want, remember the one we saw how to refer to

1237
01:54:38.910 --> 01:54:41.080
a doc file to a markdown.

1238
01:54:41.100 --> 01:54:48.690
Anthony Taylor: So what we so we would come in here and we can say we could say, list all the libraries that we don't add.

1239
01:54:49.810 --> 01:54:51.879
Anthony Taylor: and of course it's doesn't have any

1240
01:54:52.050 --> 01:55:01.869
Anthony Taylor:  This could take a minute. Anyway, we can do what's called a pip, install, and we will install

1241
01:55:01.970 --> 01:55:05.530
Anthony Taylor: that library into this environment.

1242
01:55:06.050 --> 01:55:12.420
Anthony Taylor: and it will only be here. So if you go to one of your other environments and you haven't installed it. It's not there.

1243
01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:16.359
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now, why would you care about that? Well, there's 2 reasons.

1244
01:55:16.420 --> 01:55:19.629
Anthony Taylor: One. If we care about our version

1245
01:55:19.690 --> 01:55:24.570
Anthony Taylor: of python like, I said, the class was tested in version 3.1.

1246
01:55:24.850 --> 01:55:28.790
Anthony Taylor: So they're saying, Make an environment python 3.10,

1247
01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:32.750
Anthony Taylor: that way, everything we do. We know works. Okay.

1248
01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:40.899
Anthony Taylor: that's one reason. The other reason is, you don't want a bunch of of libraries you don't need. If you're going to package your code

1249
01:55:40.990 --> 01:55:43.330
Anthony Taylor: so like mine. I have

1250
01:55:44.500 --> 01:55:52.060
Anthony Taylor: like hundreds whenever it comes up, hundreds in my route. Yes, see? So I have all these libraries and stuff.

1251
01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:59.839
Anthony Taylor: So if I was going to package code. This would be dumb. I wouldn't want to do this. I would want to create an environment. Just put what I need package that

1252
01:56:00.140 --> 01:56:05.540
Anthony Taylor: okay for right now. that's all I'm worried about. You guys understand?

1253
01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:09.080
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna go over it. When you need this.

1254
01:56:09.390 --> 01:56:13.089
Anthony Taylor: I will walk you through the one line how to do it again.

1255
01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:21.259
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it'll make more sense after you get introduced to python and python libraries.

1256
01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:26.670
Anthony Taylor: Alright, it'll make more sense then, so I just wanted to show it to you, cause they asked me to show it to you.

1257
01:56:26.900 --> 01:56:31.750
Anthony Taylor: and I wanted to make sure you saw they we asked the show to. Yes, Meredith.

1258
01:56:34.540 --> 01:56:41.200
Meredith McCanse (she/her): hold on, do we have to in order to use anaconda? Do we have to set up an account with it.

1259
01:56:41.460 --> 01:56:48.850
Anthony Taylor: No, no, don't do the kind of enterprise. Just do the the community, or whatever you do not need, and to log into them at all.

1260
01:56:49.530 --> 01:56:55.900
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I wonder if I download it won't let like past. The it won't

1261
01:56:56.590 --> 01:57:00.419
Meredith McCanse (she/her): like it has an intro window that's like sign up now, or

1262
01:57:00.490 --> 01:57:05.630
Meredith McCanse (she/her): sign in, or if you don't have an account. After after after class, we'll take a look.

1263
01:57:05.850 --> 01:57:09.250
Anthony Taylor: Okay, anybody else? Any questions. Thoughts.

1264
01:57:10.270 --> 01:57:12.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay,

1265
01:57:13.190 --> 01:57:13.940
Anthony Taylor: yeah.

1266
01:57:14.050 --> 01:57:18.660
Anthony Taylor: Wrap up class for 10 min. Class was wrapped up. Buddy.

1267
01:57:19.070 --> 01:57:28.000
Anthony Taylor: this kid. whoever's watching everything is golden. So next class we begin python program.

1268
01:57:28.660 --> 01:57:31.920
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you will be coding.

1269
01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:41.010
Anthony Taylor: We will be doing a lot of activities. There are 10 activities in the next class.

1270
01:57:42.060 --> 01:57:45.470
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Lots of them. So you will be hands on.

1271
01:57:45.590 --> 01:57:49.740
Anthony Taylor: You will become voters starting Monday.

1272
01:57:50.510 --> 01:57:51.400
Anthony Taylor: Alright

1273
01:57:52.890 --> 01:57:56.369
Anthony Taylor: awesome gang. Thank you. Have a great weekend.

1274
01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:01.749
Anthony Taylor: and I will talk to you soon. We will be here for 30 min.
