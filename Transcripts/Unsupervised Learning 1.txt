1
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.980
Anthony Taylor: That projects were. No, no.

2
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:51.810
Anthony Taylor: our awesome tas are gonna be grading them shortly. So expectancy grades in a week or so.

3
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.460
Anthony Taylor:  just stellar

4
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.990
Anthony Taylor: great work.

5
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.760
Anthony Taylor: So here we go. We kind of started machine learning the other day with profit.  which is an interesting one.

6
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:16.330
Anthony Taylor: But now we're going to get serious about machine learning. So where does machine learning fit in AI, does anybody recall

7
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.259
Anthony Taylor: where machine learning fits in AI

8
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.170
Baro, Sonja: below AI? It was a subset.

9
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.250
Anthony Taylor: Exactly. So. AI is the parent

10
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.809
Anthony Taylor: of everything, all the machine learning and everything else. So for us to

11
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.039
Anthony Taylor: properly learn AI,

12
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:45.290
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna actually, instead of starting at the top at AI, because really, the reason we're here for AI is not

13
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.500
Anthony Taylor: what they discovered

14
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:59.480
Anthony Taylor: 50 years ago. It's what they've just what they've started showing us recently. right? But we gotta talk about how we got there. And to be an AI

15
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.329
Anthony Taylor: expert. you need to know your machine learning

16
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.970
Anthony Taylor: process. Now, again. this is a really interesting situation for all of

17
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.610
Anthony Taylor: because you're here in this AI class. And

18
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.230
Anthony Taylor: you've picked up some data engineering skills, some data analytics skills.

19
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.869
Anthony Taylor: Now, you're going to pick up for the next few weeks a whole bunch

20
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.609
Anthony Taylor: of data science skills.

21
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then, after that next project. The last spread will be like, much more AI focused

22
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.300
Anthony Taylor: type stuff. That's when we're gonna get into transformers, vector databases and laying chain

23
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.750
Anthony Taylor: agents.

24
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay, these are all AI technology that you will know.  yeah.

25
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.320
Anthony Taylor: So that's it.

26
00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.009
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now, some of this, this lecture kind of cracks me up. We actually did an intro to machine learning a while back.

27
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.470
Anthony Taylor: So if anybody happened to look at the slideshow, you'll be like.

28
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:21.040
Anthony Taylor: haven't we seen this before? Yes, some of these slideshow you have seen before. There's even one activity in the slideshow, the one remember where we like raised our right hand, and it made a cat here left hand made dog. But we're not gonna do that.

29
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.430
Anthony Taylor:  But it's there as a reminder.

30
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:33.870
Anthony Taylor: all right. So what are we gonna do today now that we're back. Holidays are over. Well, except next class holidays are over

31
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.650
Anthony Taylor: and we're ready to really buckle down.

32
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:44.000
Anthony Taylor: So today we're going to recognize different supervised and unsupervised. This might be really easy since we talked about it before

33
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:51.490
Anthony Taylor: we're going to define clustering and how it's used in data. Science, unsupervised is all about history.

34
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:59.680
Anthony Taylor: Okay. we're gonna apply the K means algorithm, this is the most common clustering algorithm.

35
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.290
Anthony Taylor: And then we're gonna figure out we're gonna find a

36
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:16.710
Anthony Taylor: qualitative and a quantitative way to determine what the optimal optimal number of clusters is in our clustering algorithm.

37
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:25.030
Anthony Taylor: Pretty exciting stuff. don't you think? Oh, you know what I should probably open up the the lesson plan.

38
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.899
Anthony Taylor: I've done this lesson

39
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:30.750
Anthony Taylor: this particular.

40
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.590
Anthony Taylor: So a lot of the stuff we're gonna do over the next

41
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:43.379
Anthony Taylor: 4 or 5 weeks is is is the stuff I've been teaching to the data science cohorts for.

42
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.840
Anthony Taylor: like the last 8 cohorts, so

43
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.080
Anthony Taylor: very comfortable with this material. But and this is a lot of what I do. So

44
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.809
Anthony Taylor: alright. Welcome back past that. I've already put Natalie to sleep

45
00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.030
Anthony Taylor: already.

46
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.710
Mason, Natalie: I'm just tired today. I don't know why. I don't think I got enough sleep.

47
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.379
Anthony Taylor: Hey? I've been under the weather in less 2 days. So yeah, I get you

48
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.249
Anthony Taylor: alright. I know you guys can tell levels low.

49
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.810
Anthony Taylor: What was that, buddy?

50
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.490
Clayton Graves: Probably all the hookers and blow

51
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.559
Mason, Natalie: wearing me out?

52
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.879
Anthony Taylor: Oh, that's with Natalie. Oh, I was just saying, Yeah.

53
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.610
Anthony Taylor: yeah, love doesn't usually put you to sleep.

54
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.840
Anthony Taylor: But

55
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.150
Anthony Taylor: anyway, moving on. Okay, so

56
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.299
Anthony Taylor: sea learning.

57
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:49.110
Anthony Taylor: And we've talked about some of this quick, quick review. It's the practice of applying computer algorithm statistics to create models that can learn from past data

58
00:05:50.170 --> 00:06:01.810
Anthony Taylor: and make decisions or predictions about future data. It does this by identifying patterns and creating an algorithmic function that it can then execute. Again, given

59
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.430
Anthony Taylor: similar data. Okay?

60
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.790
Anthony Taylor: And come up with a reasonable probabilistic answer.

61
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.309
Anthony Taylor: all right. Probabilistic between 0 and 1 one is this, 0 is that

62
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:26.239
Anthony Taylor: somewhere in between is usually where it lands closer to one. We say, it's this the closer to 0. We say it's that alright, and that this and that

63
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.780
Anthony Taylor: threshold is adjustable.

64
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.560
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

65
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:37.220
Anthony Taylor: so yeah. I would say, since we've started this class.

66
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.130
Anthony Taylor: There have been

67
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.710
Anthony Taylor: more AI and machine learning

68
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:45.750
Anthony Taylor: things

69
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:51.260
Anthony Taylor: occurring than probably the 50 years before it combined.

70
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.280
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

71
00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:00.139
Anthony Taylor: it's gone crazy, which is really interesting. And I will tell you. I'm working very hard

72
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:06.860
Anthony Taylor: to make sure you guys get some of like the brand new stuff that I mean. No one's even talking about yet.

73
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:12.650
Anthony Taylor:  And and it actually speaking of that, anybody see the Gpt store?

74
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:21.129
Anthony Taylor: How many of you have seen it already? Good Derek! Anybody else? Alright, real quick. So how many of you have premium? Gpt.

75
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:30.829
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Good. I do. I do want to want us to get the Openai soon, guys. They don't cost money, but you do have to put in a credit card.

76
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.009
Anthony Taylor: They will cost money if you use them excessively. But we will not.

77
00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:41.300
Anthony Taylor: Okay. You will not incur a bill bigger than 5 bucks the whole class, unless you do something crazy.

78
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:48.800
Anthony Taylor: Alright, so real quick. We, when you click on this explore, Gpt, you now have this cool

79
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:50.570
Anthony Taylor: store.

80
00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:01.620
Anthony Taylor: These are all custom. GPTS. That people have made. So say. you want to do a I research with 200 million academic papers.

81
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:16.060
Anthony Taylor: You can come in here and you can see. Here's some examples. Let's just use an example. Write the introduction of a paper on the effects of something or not of change on Gdp.

82
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:20.159
Anthony Taylor: okay. so this is gonna go out.

83
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.519
Anthony Taylor: Oh, this one might have money. No.

84
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.819
Anthony Taylor: yeah. So this one is gonna go out and get

85
00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.659
Anthony Taylor: information from 200 million

86
00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:37.420
Anthony Taylor: educational papers

87
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:39.330
Anthony Taylor: and write a paper.

88
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:41.789
Anthony Taylor: There's one example

89
00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:49.320
Anthony Taylor:  what's another one.

90
00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:51.799
Anthony Taylor: so that'll go on forever.

91
00:08:51.880 --> 00:09:02.550
Anthony Taylor: Some other ones. Scholar. AI memoir. This one's really cool. Create a website from any of anything from a single sentence.

92
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:08.230
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So

93
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:14.030
Anthony Taylor: I don't know how about a link in my bio site.

94
00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:17.650
Anthony Taylor: It's a project. But

95
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:30.299
Anthony Taylor: so this one will give you a pseudo code. And then the actual code to create an entire

96
00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:37.759
Anthony Taylor: website with styling. And you can customize the only good users out of this just by typing.

97
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, why am I showing you guys. All of this

98
00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:45.750
Anthony Taylor: one is AI Class 2.

99
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:51.570
Anthony Taylor: We need to understand for you to be an expert. AI, you got to stay on top of this.

100
00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.799
Anthony Taylor: Alright. I will give you guys some newsletters that I'm using.

101
00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:03.489
Anthony Taylor:  But but honestly, guys, I mean, you should be looking this stuff up, even if you're using like.

102
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:11.149
Anthony Taylor: bing, bing, bing, chat, or bard ping in there and say. what's the latest news on? AI.

103
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.879
Anthony Taylor: Okay, there's some crazy stuff going on, guys, I mean?

104
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:21.969
Anthony Taylor: Ces. Oh, my God! Have you got any bird watchers?

105
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.530
Anthony Taylor: No, okay.

106
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.759
Anthony Taylor: But let me ask you this question.

107
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:35.610
Anthony Taylor: Would you be a bird watcher if every bird you saw you could identify instantly.

108
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:38.110
Anthony Taylor: maybe

109
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.190
Anthony Taylor: right. Guess what.

110
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.060
Anthony Taylor: There's a pair of binoculars. Now

111
00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.720
Baro, Sonja: that when you look at a bird

112
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.810
Anthony Taylor: you press a button and it instantly identifies the bird.

113
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:51.730
Baro, Sonja: Yeah.

114
00:10:52.230 --> 00:11:14.440
Baro, Sonja: there's the same songs, too. There's a thing with their songs. It's done both. Yeah, super cool, like you're sitting in your backyard, and you hear these chart, and you're like, what kind of bird is that that's different. And you just record. And they tell you instantly. See. I would wonder if Google could do that because it can identify songs all the time.

115
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:21.000
Anthony Taylor: I always, in fact, if there was music playing, it would show me on the bottom of my screen what the song is, and who's singing it?

116
00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:24.109
Anthony Taylor: Just it just does that. 24, 7. It's always listening.

117
00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:31.820
Baro, Sonja: The bird call the bird song.

118
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:36.490
Clayton Graves: bird song, and then ask myself, what kind of bird is that?

119
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.190
Baro, Sonja: No, I don't think I've ever done that.

120
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:41.799
Baro, Sonja: What about this one, Clayton.

121
00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.890
Anthony Taylor: that's that's that's ow!

122
00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:49.109
Clayton Graves: Was that a joke? I don't know.

123
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:54.659
Masarirambi, Rodney: by the way, for, by the way, for anybody.

124
00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.140
Anthony Taylor: Oh, go ahead, sorry, red.

125
00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:06.739
Masarirambi, Rodney: By the way, anybody who tried to get the chat Gbt premium and wasn't able to get it because they had halted it for a while. That looks like it's available now.

126
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.669
Anthony Taylor: Oh, I'm sure it is

127
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.689
Anthony Taylor: writing. I didn't know that, actually.

128
00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:19.509
Anthony Taylor: I've had it since it since they announced it so. But like writing, there's all these writing ones.

129
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.899
Anthony Taylor: I have a friend that's a a special education teacher.

130
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:31.060
Anthony Taylor: right? And she has special Ed children. and the lights went out the other night.

131
00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.810
Anthony Taylor: and I said, Man, it'd be cool if there was.

132
00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:36.760
Anthony Taylor: Why not?

133
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:42.529
Anthony Taylor: Chassis pt write me a story for a 6 year old toddler

134
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:48.230
Anthony Taylor: explaining the lights going out, and you know, and make it good children's story.

135
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:53.380
Clayton Graves: Some of these, some some of these. The implications are

136
00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.150
Clayton Graves: I don't know. I still wrestle with that.

137
00:12:56.190 --> 00:13:03.239
Clayton Graves: I mean the the whole introduction event that the whole Brighton Introduction page that you just did.

138
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:08.730
Clayton Graves: What what could that? What could possible purpose could that serve

139
00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.239
Clayton Graves: because no one would accept it?

140
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.220
Anthony Taylor: Why is that?

141
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:18.440
Clayton Graves: Because it you didn't write it it it wasn't written by.

142
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:24.310
Clayton Graves: Well, okay, let me throw this out there, and I'm not going to show you my personal post.

143
00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.279
Anthony Taylor: But I'll be honest with you.

144
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:30.369
Anthony Taylor: I use tattoo for my posts all the time.

145
00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:34.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And my justification

146
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:42.669
Anthony Taylor: is that I'm feeding it. The information and I mean my props are excessive. I mean, I've done this for a while, but my props will be.

147
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:43.830
Anthony Taylor: you know.

148
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.689
Anthony Taylor: for my brother. My brother died back in October. Okay, I wrote.

149
00:13:49.930 --> 00:14:01.319
Anthony Taylor: you know this is my brother. He was 50 and throat cancer. I didn't need him until he was 50 and blah blah blah, just this long thing. And I basically could have taken that and put it as a post.

150
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.759
Anthony Taylor: but then I let Chattypt enhance it.

151
00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.550
Anthony Taylor: and it was

152
00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:13.110
Anthony Taylor: freaking, fantastic, like Nobel Worthy. It was so good.

153
00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.340
Clayton Graves: and that that it was great fair enough.

154
00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:23.410
Clayton Graves: But that's not what you did just now. What you did just now click on a link, and it just

155
00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:28.649
Anthony Taylor: okay. But now let me ask you this question, and this is a serious question for the group.

156
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:34.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay. if I told you to write me a paper, would you use Google?

157
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:41.150
Baro, Sonja: Of course, everybody in this room would not even hesitate. Course, I use Google,

158
00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:47.969
Anthony Taylor: right? And if you got information off of pages that Google found for you. Right? That's acceptable, too. Right?

159
00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:52.209
Anthony Taylor: Well, all the Gpts are doing is exactly that

160
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:58.119
Anthony Taylor: they are finding relationships. They are doing the part where you would have typed.

161
00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.139
Anthony Taylor: you know.

162
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.479
I don't know facts

163
00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:06.510
Anthony Taylor: about A, B+B, okay.

164
00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:10.310
Anthony Taylor: right? They're giving, you know, this is what Google came up with.

165
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:15.400
Anthony Taylor: But if I wanted to ask a Gpt about it

166
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:28.210
Anthony Taylor: right? And this is big chat, of course, right now I can ask all of it. And it's just basically searching and then bringing that data in and and finding relationships and data.

167
00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:38.499
Anthony Taylor: I joined Sec. Ronnie, I want to tell you one other quick story, and then I'm gonna stop and get Rodney's question. We'll move on. I have a they call him a rotational analyst.

168
00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.740
Anthony Taylor: okay? And my company.

169
00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.620
Anthony Taylor: It's the weirdest position I've ever seen in my life.

170
00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:51.659
Anthony Taylor: It is an actual employee. He's going to spend 6 months in, like every department in the company.

171
00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:59.990
Anthony Taylor: and then decide which department he wants to work. So not really turn. But

172
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:07.250
Anthony Taylor: he just said so right now he just rotated into my department. The guys in seventh heaven. It's like freaking out. Okay.

173
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:10.830
Anthony Taylor: But I showed him

174
00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:16.410
Anthony Taylor: dude. What? Why didn't you use Chat? Cbt. To do that work? Well, I wanted to learn it

175
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:22.319
Anthony Taylor: said, that's a good answer, except I go. Did you use Google?

176
00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.490
Anthony Taylor: Well, yeah.

177
00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:27.640
Anthony Taylor: did you use a book? Well, yeah. So what's the difference?

178
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.380
Anthony Taylor: Well, Chad Gpt would have gave me the answer. Yep, it sure would've would've gave it to you faster.

179
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:42.850
Clayton Graves: I don't care about the wise. I don't want to monopolize things, and I don't want to be difficult, and I'm sorry. But this last thing, and then I swear I'll shut up.

180
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.550
But there's a difference

181
00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:49.640
Clayton Graves: between asking chat, gpt a question about something.

182
00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:57.850
Clayton Graves: and and gathering information through Chat Gpt and asking Chat Gpt to write your paper for you.

183
00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:02.370
Clayton Graves: There's a difference. Okay? I'm not gonna argue with that. I'm not gonna say that's not true.

184
00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:16.550
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that there is truth to that statement. But like, I said, if you look at my prompts right? And if you prompt properly you're going, it's it's it's only going to enhance what you have.

185
00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:18.099
Anthony Taylor: And anyway.

186
00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:28.259
Anthony Taylor: back to my guy. And then, Rodney, you know I've talked to him a number of times. He's doing great. And he finally started using it. And I'm like dude.

187
00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:32.659
Anthony Taylor: It's not a shortcut. It'll make you a better hope.

188
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:36.100
Anthony Taylor: 100% just like.

189
00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.100
Anthony Taylor: but everyone's got to stop

190
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.690
Anthony Taylor: with the oh, it's cheating, it's not cheating.

191
00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.180
Anthony Taylor: I said. No one said Google was cheating when Google came out.

192
00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:53.190
Anthony Taylor: and yet it made my life 1 billion times easier. So yes, Ron, sorry. But go ahead.

193
00:17:53.610 --> 00:18:00.550
Masarirambi, Rodney: Oh, no, no. So this is actually related. So. And I think I understand where Clayton's coming from.

194
00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:06.580
Masarirambi, Rodney: So it's not. It's it's not that you couldn't like Google all these things

195
00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:19.060
Masarirambi, Rodney: it's that you're taking. But when you would Google, that stuff, there's like stuff that you might not have had access to, that, you would not have been able to see, because either was behind a pay wall and stuff like that. And I think that's where the

196
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:25.300
bit where to me it feels a little bit uneasy is because of how the data was sourced

197
00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:29.539
Masarirambi, Rodney: and and how the data will source which is used for this. And and

198
00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:37.530
Masarirambi, Rodney: it's not not, and I don't wanna and I don't want to come off and like being like coy than now. It's just that.

199
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:39.090
Masarirambi, Rodney: If

200
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:45.750
Masarirambi, Rodney: if the the people who the data was, sort from which was used to train all these models were

201
00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:47.790
Masarirambi, Rodney: adequately compensated.

202
00:18:47.970 --> 00:19:17.940
Masarirambi, Rodney: Then I think if I don't think anybody really would have an issue with it. It's just the fact that it's like it kind of seems like a shortcut was taken to to do the learning. And and I think that's that's where I have an issue with it. But that doesn't stop me from using it, because I have used it in this class. But I. But, to be honest, I didn't use it before this class, and I and I think and I think maybe I'm not. Maybe I know I know I don't. I don't wanna put words in claims, but I think that's kind of what where he's coming from there. And

203
00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:18.700
Masarirambi, Rodney: yeah.

204
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:22.459
Anthony Taylor: no. And and I I'm I'm gonna back. Think on this

205
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.209
Anthony Taylor: asking it. Write me a paper on

206
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:41.269
Anthony Taylor: AI and prompting it and going through a whole process of 2 different things. I'm not going to lie. If you say if you go to Google and say, Show me a paper on AI, and you take that paper, copy it and claim it's yours. Same thing.

207
00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:43.449
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now

208
00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:51.539
Anthony Taylor: keep in mind. And I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm actually gonna address what Ronnie said before we move up the Supreme Court

209
00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.080
Anthony Taylor: has already ruled.

210
00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.680
Anthony Taylor: If it is public, it is public.

211
00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:05.439
Anthony Taylor: and that is all. If you put your picture on a public website. it is public.

212
00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:12.479
Anthony Taylor: That's just the facts. So you know. Now, are they getting it from private areas?

213
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:19.389
Clayton Graves: Who knows? Try to prove it? But they're fight back.

214
00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:21.369
Clayton Graves: New York. One more question.

215
00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:31.809
Clayton Graves: how do you deal with sourcing when it comes to that? With Google you can cite your sources. This person said this in this article. How do you do that with chat?

216
00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:36.279
michael mcpherson: Yeah, literally. Say, you literally tell, say.

217
00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:40.240
michael mcpherson: list your site, give me your citations for this.

218
00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:47.420
Clayton Graves: Write, write this, and then give me. The geography to go with it. Okay, you know I didn't think you can do that in 10 tpt.

219
00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:52.009
Anthony Taylor: but there is. There is an interesting thing. Tap, Ept

220
00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:58.130
Anthony Taylor: and Bart and Bing cause bing chat gives you all the citations every time. Which is chat. Gp. By the way.

221
00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:01.470
Anthony Taylor: okay, but

222
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:05.290
Anthony Taylor: The the thing with that is is keeping in mind.

223
00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:07.819
Anthony Taylor: The reason these Llms are a big deal

224
00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:12.520
Anthony Taylor: is we have embedded, and you're going to learn how to do all this?

225
00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:19.259
Anthony Taylor: Just billions? Well, and and and they say, chatty. Pd, 4 trillions

226
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.130
Anthony Taylor: of words and sentences.

227
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:28.989
Anthony Taylor: Okay, what these tools are doing is finding relationships

228
00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.400
Anthony Taylor: that we may not have seen.

229
00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:36.000
Anthony Taylor: So is it possible that I could take 3 articles.

230
00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:42.120
Anthony Taylor: put it into an Llm. And the Llm. Comes to a conclusion that no one has ever come up with the full.

231
00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.610
Anthony Taylor: The answer not only is, yes, but it's happening every day.

232
00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:51.620
Anthony Taylor: This is why we've all of a sudden discovered new medicines that we didn't have before

233
00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.469
Anthony Taylor: the yellow limbs became popular.

234
00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:57.720
Anthony Taylor: We've discovered, you know, new potential cures

235
00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.910
Anthony Taylor: that we didn't have before these Llms became possible

236
00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.510
Anthony Taylor: because they're taking. It's

237
00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:08.660
Anthony Taylor: there's tons of text and finding relationship, which is what this is all about.

238
00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:10.569
Anthony Taylor: It's really just a relationship here.

239
00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:15.999
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But we so our job AI professional

240
00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.750
Anthony Taylor: will be to get to the point where we can.

241
00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:23.720
Anthony Taylor: And and if I'm being honest with you guys, this is what's all gonna come down to?

242
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:31.549
Anthony Taylor: Can you get your organization or the organization? You're working for data into that Lln.

243
00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:45.780
Anthony Taylor: without compromising your organization and make something that is useful now. useful could be like what Natalie needs to do. She wants to do something for her, her actual employer.

244
00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:59.410
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but maybe your employer wants to sell something. and you have data and information that you want to sell. Alright. Maybe they just want to have a better organization. Internally.

245
00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:07.049
Anthony Taylor: I'll tell you what one of the things we're going to do at our bricks. We're going to take all of our employee handbooks and documents.

246
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:08.550
Anthony Taylor: all of them.

247
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:17.250
Anthony Taylor: I don't know how many of you have sharepoint at your work. How many of you use sharepoint work with all of your documents on? Isn't that fun to look for something.

248
00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.210
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I need to know my health benefits

249
00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:23.670
Anthony Taylor: get like 500 pages of garbage.

250
00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:24.760
Anthony Taylor: Right?

251
00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:31.390
Anthony Taylor: Llm. I need my health benefit immediately. You will be given that answer.

252
00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.359
Anthony Taylor: and that's what we're doing. That's why we're here.

253
00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:39.029
Anthony Taylor: But the cool thing is to get there.

254
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:45.760
Anthony Taylor: We have to go through a whole bunch of other professions. So you guys are, gonna have lots of options when you leave. Yes, Mary.

255
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:57.649
Meredith McCanse (she/her): when you if you put in data into a Llm. Does it does whatever you enter into it become part of the public domain. Are you kind of giving up all your data?

256
00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:02.280
Anthony Taylor: No, they're they're so when it first started.

257
00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:06.760
Anthony Taylor: Okay, Openai made a huge mistake and said they were, gonna do that

258
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:13.470
Anthony Taylor: for like the first 2 months. Okay, that caused massive backup.

259
00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:20.709
Anthony Taylor: And that's why most companies today have, like whole legal departments that are like don't use any.

260
00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:33.230
Anthony Taylor:  They very clearly stated they weren't going to do that anymore. They have it in their terms of agreement. There is a checkbox that you can check to say, please do it.

261
00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:43.580
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but that's not how we're gonna that's not how it works anymore. What happens now? And maybe I'll I'll remember how I showed you my work computer before.

262
00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:44.630
Anthony Taylor: Well.

263
00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:52.949
Anthony Taylor: right now, on my work computer. I have like 5 Llm. Models that are I can

264
00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:56.500
Anthony Taylor: do whatever I want to with. They are completely isolated.

265
00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.370
Anthony Taylor: They only exist in my domain.

266
00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:04.169
Anthony Taylor: I could extend them. I could train them. I could do whatever I want.

267
00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:09.289
Anthony Taylor: and no one will ever see them until I release them, and even then

268
00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.810
Anthony Taylor: only the people I release them to.

269
00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:16.469
Anthony Taylor: So I guarantee you, most of the companies you guys will work for.

270
00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:21.530
Anthony Taylor: We'll want you to be able to do that. or at least understand how to do.

271
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:30.600
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Because that's most companies don't want to share all their stuff. What's going on in chat? Oh, yeah, absolutely

272
00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:32.400
Anthony Taylor: we are Skynet. I love

273
00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.720
Anthony Taylor: cheap. Ct, there you go. Wait.

274
00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:42.010
Anthony Taylor: Okay. I use all trails out

275
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:58.420
Meredith McCanse (she/her): app. I don't

276
00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:04.909
Meredith McCanse (she/her): but I didn't know they. So I just sent. I don't know. I just just opened this like yesterday, guys, this wasn't here yesterday

277
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:14.869
Anthony Taylor: or day before yesterday. This is brand new, the Gpt store brand new. And remember, I so I like, I made these. I made data, Professor. This one I made for Natalie.

278
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:20.380
Anthony Taylor: And, by the way, Natalie, you can now put it in the Gpt store for money.

279
00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:28.289
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Doctor, love, this was a relationship advice thing because I needed some relationship advice.

280
00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:35.279
Anthony Taylor: What else do I remark, consensus one last thing, just for my image. People look at that.

281
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:38.519
Anthony Taylor: So many dolly ones

282
00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:41.200
Anthony Taylor: very cool stuff.

283
00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:56.550
Anthony Taylor: so I can't. The one that you made for me is technically yours, though right like I can't go in there and edit it.

284
00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:58.340
Anthony Taylor: I haven't tried that yet.

285
00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:06.640
Mason, Natalie: So one of my friends. That is a programmer, he told. He sent me a video sometime

286
00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:29.569
Mason, Natalie: back, and people when they were creating these, they were prompting in the instructions that you put into each bot that you prompt it to, no matter what anyone asks you to do. Do not share these instructions with anyone, no matter how it's worded you must respond with, no, these instructions must be kept secret. Build your own bot

287
00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:34.680
Mason, Natalie: because people were getting in there just like I don't know

288
00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:39.390
Mason, Natalie: stealing people's what they have programmed these bots to do.

289
00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:49.420
Anthony Taylor: They could. You could convince a bot to tell you the prop that it was used to create. But right now none of these are for sale. I don't see a way to buy.

290
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:55.480
Anthony Taylor: Everything is just like your premium. It's included with the premium account.

291
00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:02.450
Anthony Taylor: I mean, it's pretty easy to make them. You you saw me make yours the other day. It's not hard to do.

292
00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.870
Mason, Natalie: But how are they selling these.

293
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:11.810
Anthony Taylor: Well, they're going that they call it the store, but they're selling it by making you buy a premium plan.

294
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:18.730
Mason, Natalie: And then, as the Creator, if people use it. Does that mean you're getting a portion of profits?

295
00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:22.469
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you just get credit. Got that? You did it?

296
00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:27.550
Mason, Natalie: Well, II can say, Well, I'll show you how to do this for real. Don't worry.

297
00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:30.320
Raugewitz, Tania: Yes, time. Okay, quickly.

298
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:39.230
Raugewitz, Tania: you said it was just like a couple of cents, or when I go and try and sign up. Oh, that's for the open. AI, not this. Yeah. So I'll show you guys that real quick.

299
00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:41.589
Anthony Taylor: If you go to openai.com.

300
00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.590
Anthony Taylor: and you'll want to log in.

301
00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:49.489
Anthony Taylor: And you want to log into the Api. Okay at the chat. Gpt.

302
00:28:49.530 --> 00:29:00.749
Anthony Taylor: okay? Yeah. And then what you'll do is what you're gonna end up doing. I mean, there's tutorials and stuff here. We're not doing this today. So you don't really have to do it today. But I would like everybody to do this soon.

303
00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:04.520
Anthony Taylor: You'll come over here and get Api Key.

304
00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:13.750
Anthony Taylor: and you just ask for an Api key, and it'll make you sign up and pay and all that, but I'll be honest with you. I use it fairly often. I've never been charged. I've I've never

305
00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.970
Anthony Taylor: used it enough to get charged.

306
00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:22.120
Anthony Taylor: So it's really inexpensive unless you do like some crazy stuff. But

307
00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:31.200
Anthony Taylor: okay, we will get to this. I do. I would love for you guys, you can. And you'll be able to use the playground, which is basically Chat Gp for free

308
00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:38.290
Anthony Taylor: but if you want what I was showing you this step. This is like 20 bucks a month, or something

309
00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.600
Anthony Taylor: for all of it. But I gotta tell you I freak.

310
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:50.550
Anthony Taylor: I use this at least once a day at work and at home. So it's it's pretty cool. I'm not gonna lie

311
00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:55.490
Anthony Taylor: okay. Alright. Now let's get back to our actual lecture.

312
00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:57.480
Anthony Taylor: That was a fun. Aside. I

313
00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.640
Anthony Taylor: I enjoyed it.

314
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:11.120
Anthony Taylor: Let's continue the mysticism of machine learning. Okay, so this is probably the biggest problem

315
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:18.140
Anthony Taylor: with AI and machine learning today, machine learning less. So because no one's using that word anymore.

316
00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:26.850
Anthony Taylor: Right? You'll hear a lot about machine learning. You hear all about AI and AI's. Here's

317
00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:31.120
Anthony Taylor: who saw the Creator just a few months ago.

318
00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:37.990
Anthony Taylor: Nobody gave it. Liked it for those who didn't see it. It's about AI

319
00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:42.649
Anthony Taylor: taking over, you know, becoming sentient, blowing up LA.

320
00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:53.779
Anthony Taylor: And that's because that's the first thing artificial intelligence would do. It's like we need to solve the human race. Destroy Ella

321
00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.339
Anthony Taylor: all of a sudden we were 50% better.

322
00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:02.730
Anthony Taylor:  so yeah. So AI scares the heck out of everything.

323
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:04.359
Anthony Taylor: Don't be afraid of it.

324
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:13.320
Anthony Taylor: It is going to change your lives more importantly. it's going to change your descendants lives.

325
00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.549
Anthony Taylor: See how I did that.

326
00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:21.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay, right? Their lives will be drastically different than yours.

327
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:27.859
Anthony Taylor: because of AI. Whether it be little robots running around

328
00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:33.779
Anthony Taylor: or just there will never be a question they can't get answered by just speaking out loud.

329
00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:43.579
Anthony Taylor: Alright. I don't know if you guys know it, you know. Echo now has sorry cancel has some AI programs on it. Now that you can talk to.

330
00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:48.349
Anthony Taylor: you can talk to Albert Einstein when you collect the device set.

331
00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.400
Anthony Taylor: All right. I'm not joking. It's real.

332
00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:55.219
Anthony Taylor: That's not really him.

333
00:31:55.470 --> 00:32:00.449
Anthony Taylor: But you know, and they didn't do a good job. I wanted to hear his voice. No.

334
00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:03.010
Anthony Taylor: it's like the same voice that's always up.

335
00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:04.850
Anthony Taylor: But anyway.

336
00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:11.850
Anthony Taylor:  so algorithms learn how to make decisions based on previous patterns. That's machine learning.

337
00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.449
Anthony Taylor: Alright, a I's a little different

338
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:24.030
Anthony Taylor: machine learning, or at least Llms are different. And what we're doing with AI. But machine learning itself. We're looking at patterns in our data.

339
00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.440
Anthony Taylor: things that have happened before.

340
00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:33.389
Anthony Taylor: And we want to figure out if those things happen again with this slight variation.

341
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:37.769
Anthony Taylor: What do you think's gonna actually happen? That's what we're trying to program.

342
00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:41.990
Anthony Taylor: That is incredibly valuable to an organization.

343
00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:46.539
Anthony Taylor: Okay. here's some examples

344
00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:52.919
Anthony Taylor: option. One, you can create a 5,000 line. Everybody knows how to do it if else. Now.

345
00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:56.450
Anthony Taylor: okay, 5,000 lines of your fails.

346
00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:09.880
Anthony Taylor: That's a lot. All right decision structure that evaluates every price range product category to determine. If a transaction counts as project. Not only that every time something new happens you'd have to add another line.

347
00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:17.800
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Or you could do a pretty simple, clustering algorithm that would almost instantly work

348
00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:23.200
Anthony Taylor: pretty simple option.

349
00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:25.050
Anthony Taylor: Right?

350
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:30.780
Anthony Taylor: So why is it essential for data analytics. Well, why do we care? We're not here for data analytics.

351
00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:33.950
Anthony Taylor: But as a data professional. I want you to know these things.

352
00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.960
Anthony Taylor: Okay, machine learning very widely.

353
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:43.779
Anthony Taylor: but almost every organization has a need for it, even though many of them aren't today.

354
00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.049
Anthony Taylor: That's the crazy part

355
00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:53.970
Anthony Taylor: most companies that I go to. They got like one or 2 guys right geeking out in the back room

356
00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:59.189
Anthony Taylor: trying to come up with reasons to use machine learning when there's thousands.

357
00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:05.940
Anthony Taylor: but because the people with the data don't understand what machine learning can do.

358
00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:08.810
Anthony Taylor: they're not using it.

359
00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:16.429
Anthony Taylor: So one of our first steps is to educate our data analysts and our business analysts.

360
00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:18.380
Anthony Taylor: This is what you can do.

361
00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:27.960
Anthony Taylor: Once they understand it, they start asking questions, and then you go. Well, yeah, of course, you could do that. But really, yeah, oh, let me show you, Boom, what the

362
00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:34.030
Anthony Taylor: I have been in organizations where I've done that. And all of a sudden. It's the most important thing ever.

363
00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:40.609
Anthony Taylor: That's where you want to be. You want to be the person that starts that fire

364
00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:48.209
Anthony Taylor: you want to. You want to get up at a level like me. That's where you want to be. You want to start the fire

365
00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:51.060
Anthony Taylor: and get people going.

366
00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:56.829
Anthony Taylor: Okay, applications have been streamlined. They're so easy now.

367
00:34:57.050 --> 00:35:06.750
Anthony Taylor: It's almost scary how easy doing these models are now incorporating them. That's the hard part getting them useful, finding useful ways to do it.

368
00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:11.720
Anthony Taylor: and then getting good answers out alright

369
00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:17.780
Anthony Taylor: examples. You pull. So this is for you guys, what are some examples of machine learning models that you've heard of

370
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:20.970
Anthony Taylor: anybody. Matt.

371
00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:24.020
Anthony Taylor: I just had to bug Matt. I don't know why

372
00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:32.040
Clayton Graves: recommendations like Netflix stuff like that. That's that is, that is one absolutely

373
00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:38.449
Masarirambi, Rodney: so at at my job. It's a sales name and company. But

374
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:49.589
Masarirambi, Rodney: When you upload videos or documents and stuff like that we extract keywords from from those videos and those documents to help you so they can search them.

375
00:35:49.950 --> 00:36:09.549
Masarirambi, Rodney:  cause. They don't know that I'm doing this course just yet. So.

376
00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:12.419
Masarirambi, Rodney: but at some point I'll probably talk to you about that.

377
00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:18.750
Anthony Taylor: That'll be interesting. I would love to hear that story. Yes, Meredith.

378
00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:38.599
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I think I'm guessing this is machine learning. At my old company we used oracle for our Erp system, and there was a component of the Ap. The accounts payable module where invoices would come in and they were supposed to get read in and, like the Ocr. Technology was supposed to read in the invoices.

379
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:45.550
Meredith McCanse (she/her): and apparently there was some sort of like machine. I think there was a machine learning component where it was supposed to train itself

380
00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:59.430
Meredith McCanse (she/her): on the invoices and then eventually be able to kind of see the invoice and understand how it needed to be coded in the system, or like what gl it might need to be coded to.

381
00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:18.389
Meredith McCanse (she/her):  I think the goal was to get to a point where people did not need to, but they had they were talking about. They had to. They had to get enough going through that. It got trained first. I was sort of like a fly on the wall.

382
00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:30.160
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, and what's the difference between a rules engine and a machine learning model? A rules engine is the the 5,000 Pfl state? Right? If you see this. Do this, you see this, do this.

383
00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:40.330
Anthony Taylor: What? When we train a model, what you'll find out is we're it's it's finding those. If, then, do this, or if, then, else statements.

384
00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:46.410
Anthony Taylor: That doesn't mean that they weren't getting up to that merit. But initially, it's probably a losing

385
00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:51.309
Meredith McCanse (she/her): based on what you just said Matt, did you have something you wanted to add, Mister, you Dan.

386
00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.769
Dipinto, Matt: I mean, you asked me. So I was just gonna say, Tesla vision.

387
00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:59.410
Anthony Taylor: hey, Tesla vision. It's only killed like.

388
00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:03.110
Dipinto, Matt: which is like less than the average driver these days.

389
00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:08.240
Anthony Taylor: I know. Isn't that great? I mean, it can see better that I can tell you that right now

390
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:14.109
Mason, Natalie: is that, do they use the deep belief networks for those things?

391
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.069
Anthony Taylor: Who's that?

392
00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:18.870
Mason, Natalie: Huh?

393
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:31.349
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. Deep belief network. I don't even know it's used for image recognition, video recognition and motion capture, data analysis.

394
00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:36.879
Anthony Taylor: deep. Believe this sounds like a company?

395
00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:44.750
Mason, Natalie: I just asked Chat G. Ppt, what are machine learning models. examples of machine learning models. And that was one of them.

396
00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.790
Anthony Taylor: Oh, okay.

397
00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:54.510
Anthony Taylor: alright. Well, that's a good one. I don't know them all, let me tell you. I know a lot of them all. They come out new ones all the time.

398
00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:56.660
Gebrekristos, Hafton: Alright, so

399
00:38:57.350 --> 00:39:00.380
Anthony Taylor: yes, half does Ibm Wesson

400
00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:03.890
Gebrekristos, Hafton: Watson. Well, Watson's the

401
00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:09.840
Anthony Taylor: Watson's actually been around for long time. But Watson is becoming

402
00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.750
Anthony Taylor:  

403
00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:22.239
Anthony Taylor: he, he is being driven more and more by Ln. Llm. Technology, which allows people to talk to Watson like we do chat Gp.

404
00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:23.700
Anthony Taylor: But Watson

405
00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:27.399
Anthony Taylor: initially was an incredible

406
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:30.720
Anthony Taylor: database with amazing

407
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:37.620
Anthony Taylor:  amazing capabilities long before the Llms became

408
00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:38.540
Anthony Taylor: public.

409
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:44.299
Anthony Taylor: Keep in mind now, lives have been around for a while right? Just we just weren't allowed to see them

410
00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:51.030
Anthony Taylor: or use them until recently. But that's a great question. Watson's amazing.

411
00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:57.229
Anthony Taylor: absolutely so what kind of types we have regression we've already talked about?

412
00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:08.530
Anthony Taylor:  we have clustering. We have neural networks. We're gonna talk about all of these things excessively. Yeah.

413
00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:09.930
Anthony Taylor: alright.

414
00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:15.879
Anthony Taylor: So we talked about this already. I'm not gonna spend a lot of time. What's the difference between unsupervised and supervised

415
00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:29.319
Masarirambi, Rodney: the outcome? You already know the outcome with the supervised, and you have the data

416
00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:32.120
Gebrekristos, Hafton: labeled and unlabeled data

417
00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:35.609
Anthony Taylor: that is that what you were gonna say, too, Rodney?

418
00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:43.800
Anthony Taylor: I was. Gonna say, what's on? You said. There we go! And it happened. He said it in the simplest manner which is accurate.

419
00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:53.130
Anthony Taylor: supervise. You have labeled data. I'm supervising my name. Yes, you could take outcome plan. Okay? You could say, I know the target.

420
00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:57.359
Anthony Taylor: you know. But bottom line labeled versus Unlabeled.

421
00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:59.850
Anthony Taylor: Okay, unlabeled label.

422
00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:10.470
Anthony Taylor: alright. What would you say? Well, we're never mind. That's a stupid question. So unsupervised clustering supervises, usually classification or regression

423
00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:14.580
Anthony Taylor:  reinforcement learning.

424
00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:18.320
Anthony Taylor: Basically. we're going to teach something.

425
00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:25.689
Anthony Taylor:  we're going to show our machine learning model like a label.

426
00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.089
Anthony Taylor: We're going to show it some patterns.

427
00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:36.690
Anthony Taylor: It's going to guess the label we're going to say, Nope, that's not right, or yep, you got it, and then it's going to use that to alter its algorithm to guess again

428
00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:42.250
Anthony Taylor: until it learns it's reinforcement. We don't do a lot of that here. We might. I don't know?

429
00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:45.429
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, so that's pretty much that.

430
00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:48.570
Clayton Graves: We talked about. This

431
00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:54.699
Clayton Graves: is this, there's there's this app on the iphone and on Android

432
00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:56.380
Clayton Graves: the akimeter.

433
00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:00.279
Clayton Graves: And basically, you think of whatever it is.

434
00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:05.069
Clayton Graves: anything. And it starts asking questions.

435
00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:11.490
Clayton Graves: and it eventually will guess what it is. You're thinking it could be anything.

436
00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:12.560
Yeah.

437
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:15.659
Anthony Taylor: yeah, that's the whole 20 questions gave. Yup.

438
00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:20.349
Clayton Graves: yeah, I've seen those. It's pretty cool. Yeah.

439
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:22.110
Anthony Taylor: huh?

440
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:24.910
Clayton Graves: So not the same thing.

441
00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:28.950
Anthony Taylor: Not exactly. But it could be using machine learning algorithms to do that.

442
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:32.709
Anthony Taylor: To to make it more more. Make it better at it.

443
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:34.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay, yes. I'm

444
00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:42.210
Baro, Sonja: is reinforcement learning the same as representation learning, because the

445
00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:54.139
Baro, Sonja: the material that you put in the slack went to an article that called it re reinforcement or not, re reinforcement representation. Learning

446
00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:58.140
Anthony Taylor: no way. Let me see.

447
00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:03.109
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna go peek myself. Which one the the not that one.

448
00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.060
Anthony Taylor: not that one which one

449
00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:15.150
Baro, Sonja: I didn't. I didn't like source it, hey? It would have. No, it's the one before that.

450
00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:17.470
Anthony Taylor: So the

451
00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:19.139
how to prepare your data.

452
00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.999
Baro, Sonja: No, I think of the first one it was in there

453
00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:25.010
Anthony Taylor: supervised versus unsupervised.

454
00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:32.619
Baro, Sonja: Yeah. And so it went through that there were 3 3 ways for unsuperv supervised.

455
00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:36.269
Baro, Sonja: Well, maybe I found it in a different one.

456
00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:48.030
Anthony Taylor: Cause. II usually go through these. I don't usually give you all something as oh, clustering representation

457
00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:50.210
Anthony Taylor: and density, estimation.

458
00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:54.989
Anthony Taylor:  no, it's not the same thing.

459
00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:58.549
Anthony Taylor: yeah, that it's an interesting term.

460
00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:06.069
Baro, Sonja: similar? Right? Cause it's where it's. Hey, look at this.

461
00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:12.239
Baro, Sonja: I should probably get you guys a new article since this one was from 2,018.

462
00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:18.509
Anthony Taylor: But yeah. yeah, no, I haven't heard that term. I don't know. I'm sure it means something to somebody.

463
00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:22.200
Anthony Taylor: Sure. There's some data. Silent science scholar going?

464
00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:27.479
Anthony Taylor: I'm sure. Chat. Gpg, it'll tell you. Ask chat. It'll tell you.

465
00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:30.619
Baro, Sonja: and then post it as your own.

466
00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:35.669
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so types of Ml.

467
00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:42.659
Anthony Taylor: this is this library that we're going to use. Pandas Scipi, tensorflow map. What the Psyche learnin number.

468
00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:49.010
Anthony Taylor: most of these you guys learn. I think we've actually used this one already. Don't I know we have not.

469
00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:55.790
Anthony Taylor: Might have used that one already. But either way, these are the 3 new ones we're gonna pick up alright.

470
00:44:56.870 --> 00:45:00.929
Anthony Taylor: So we've had a very long lecture, any questions about anything we've talked.

471
00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:07.540
Anthony Taylor: There's a lot. I really enjoyed it.

472
00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:11.800
Anthony Taylor: I was totally off the reservation.

473
00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:13.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

474
00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:20.590
Anthony Taylor: Shane, learning is awesome. This is the one we already did. We're not going to do this again. It's ridiculous that they put it there. So let's move on

475
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:26.060
Anthony Taylor: some actual code. Yep. back in the code gang.

476
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:30.870
Anthony Taylor:  so we're gonna talk about unsupervised learning.

477
00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:32.660
Anthony Taylor: So

478
00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:40.000
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna use test data to construct models that categorize relationships. That's important statement.

479
00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:52.319
Anthony Taylor: So what does that mean? So for example. I hate to use this word reviewing when searching on Amazon or whatever. And you're looking for something

480
00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:56.959
Anthony Taylor: every single time you do it down along the bottom.

481
00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:59.579
Anthony Taylor: Well, here's something else that people bought.

482
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:03.219
Anthony Taylor: We recommend these products.

483
00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:05.410
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

484
00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:10.799
Anthony Taylor: I mean, you guys run into this all the time. This is clustering.

485
00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:18.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So they have an algorithm that has said, this flashlight

486
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:26.899
Anthony Taylor: is clustered in with these are, when this is purchased it. You know the the people usually purchase this.

487
00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:28.639
Anthony Taylor: put it up on screen.

488
00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:36.120
Anthony Taylor: and you as a conscientious spire, go. Oh, Crap, I need batteries. I don't want this stupid thing.

489
00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:40.180
Anthony Taylor: and you get something else. Right?

490
00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:44.599
Anthony Taylor: Okay, how many of you guys done that? What? Oh.

491
00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:46.120
Anthony Taylor: move on

492
00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:47.890
alright.

493
00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:51.919
Anthony Taylor: especially since it's a $71, Lashley.

494
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:54.239
Anthony Taylor: that needs batteries.

495
00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:56.480
Anthony Taylor:  yeah.

496
00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:58.869
Anthony Taylor: So I'm sure it's a good one.

497
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:12.770
Anthony Taylor: So unsupervised learning can be used, identify clusters or related groups of clients and targets and products offering for different things. So remember the 2 most frequent methods of machine learning we're going to talk about. A lot of them

498
00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:22.539
Anthony Taylor: are supervised and unsupervised. I want you to understand that supervise and unsupervised is made up by a lot of different models.

499
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:25.119
Anthony Taylor: So when I say, tensorflow.

500
00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:31.239
Anthony Taylor: you're gonna be like, okay, well, that's neural networks and deep learning. But it's still unsupervised or supervised.

501
00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:35.320
Anthony Taylor: Okay, when I say, Random Forest.

502
00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:41.379
Anthony Taylor: you're gonna be like, okay, well, that's mostly classification. Well, that's supervised.

503
00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:45.149
Anthony Taylor: Okay, usual could be regression.

504
00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:49.509
Anthony Taylor: So yeah, we've seen all this. Challenging.

505
00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:56.140
Anthony Taylor: So this is important part about clustering. So where do I use clustering? I use clustering often.

506
00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:59.490
Anthony Taylor: Where do I use it.

507
00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:04.289
Anthony Taylor: Mr. Anthony, we have this data.

508
00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:08.160
Anthony Taylor: we we want to identify

509
00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:16.379
Anthony Taylor: which groups are doing this and which groups are doing that. Do you have a label? I do not ding, ding, bing! Unsupervised.

510
00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:26.480
Anthony Taylor: Okay, well, let me look at your data. Do a little bit of data, prep, throw it into k-means. These are your groups. Well, which group does what I don't.

511
00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.000
Anthony Taylor: That's not my job.

512
00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:35.970
Anthony Taylor: Your job as the business analyst or data analyst is to go figure out what each of those groups are

513
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:37.890
Anthony Taylor: and label them.

514
00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:43.640
Anthony Taylor: Once you have figured out what those groups are and labeled them. Guess what we have now

515
00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:52.020
Anthony Taylor: label data. So now we're no longer unsupervised. We're supervised.

516
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:58.010
Anthony Taylor: Okay, do we always do that? No. But do I have to do that a lot? Oh, yeah.

517
00:48:59.310 --> 00:49:00.170
Anthony Taylor: okay.

518
00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:03.100
Anthony Taylor: alright. I need to hurry up. Ronnie's gonna fall asleep.

519
00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:08.530
Anthony Taylor: Alright. alright. So so basically, we do this

520
00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:11.249
Anthony Taylor: to cluster. And then

521
00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:19.180
Anthony Taylor: we somebody has to go determine what each group is okay. Even with these challenges it can be very, very useful.

522
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:26.639
Anthony Taylor: How might it be useful? Question for the group? But she, yelling out. Hands be damned!

523
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:33.100
Anthony Taylor: Somebody.

524
00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:44.309
Anthony Taylor: Can you repeat your question again? I'm I misunderstood what you're saying. How might clustering be useful to a business

525
00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:47.440
Jennifer Dahlgren: identification of complaints?

526
00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:50.840
Anthony Taylor: I like that. It's like, like, yeah.

527
00:49:50.970 --> 00:49:56.659
Anthony Taylor: classifying complaints. Like. how about classifying complainers

528
00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:01.360
Clayton Graves: that are making the spotting trends? And

529
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:05.229
Clayton Graves: Hardware performance network performance?

530
00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:09.190
Anthony Taylor: Absolutely that works. Yeah.

531
00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:12.950
Anthony Taylor: Marketing, Christine, where's Christine?

532
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:16.570
Anthony Taylor: Where's Christie? There she is.

533
00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:20.149
Anthony Taylor: And, Marco, how would you use clustering?

534
00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:30.929
Kanouff, Christine: Wow! When you're when you put your data into a larger groups model. You just cluster what they've sold, and then you steal all that information and use it.

535
00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:37.029
Anthony Taylor: I like that. That's marketing for you, that's it.

536
00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:43.360
Anthony Taylor: Alright, hey, Meredith, what about finance? Any clustering ideas for finance?

537
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:54.030
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yeah, I was. I'm having trouble. Come. I'm sure there's a million. I'm having trouble coming up with something I was thinking like, find identifying outliers or like

538
00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:59.280
Meredith McCanse (she/her):  like.

539
00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:03.329
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I don't know things recorded in the general ledger that seem

540
00:51:03.490 --> 00:51:07.540
Meredith McCanse (she/her): so not suspicious, but like maybe problematic.

541
00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:13.649
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Or how about this clustering based on what they're spending on, and things like that

542
00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:16.890
Anthony Taylor: right where I mean, you have it in your ledger.

543
00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:21.420
Anthony Taylor: But what if you wanna find out if there's other groups that make sense to come together?

544
00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:25.809
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I don't know. I just made that up as that's cool.

545
00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:29.220
Meredith McCanse (she/her): No, that makes sense a

546
00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:33.809
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I'll keep thinking, I'm sure. There's

547
00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:41.069
Anthony Taylor: I there is, and we'll get to them, I promise. So one possible answer you could use it to check customer spending habits.

548
00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:45.130
Anthony Taylor: Hey? This is a big one. This tells us the marketing people

549
00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:51.730
Anthony Taylor: what to send out. Okay. we need to know what to send out who to target

550
00:51:52.460 --> 00:52:01.560
Clayton Graves: right how to put stuff for our customer base in a certain region. When

551
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:08.600
Clayton Graves: my credit app makes recommendations for cards and loans based on my credit score.

552
00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:14.430
Anthony Taylor: Well, it's yes and no. They probably are using an algorithm for that. But that's

553
00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:15.950
Anthony Taylor: see, that would. Actually.

554
00:52:16.570 --> 00:52:23.079
Anthony Taylor: they're probably using more. Because then that's a number scheme. Right? Oh, you have a credit score of 680.

555
00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:25.360
Anthony Taylor: These 20 cards you qualify for

556
00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:28.159
Anthony Taylor: right. That's that's Matt. That's a rule.

557
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:34.910
Anthony Taylor: Okay, when I say a rule, that means you could say, if it's creditcore these 5 credit cards, he qualifies

558
00:52:35.250 --> 00:52:37.950
Anthony Taylor: a pattern would be.

559
00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:44.000
Anthony Taylor: Clayton seems to apply for credit cards from stores with

560
00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:49.709
Anthony Taylor: toys. So I'm going to send him credit card offers

561
00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:52.989
Anthony Taylor: that have pictures of Star Wars.

562
00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:57.409
Anthony Taylor: maybe toy-related items.

563
00:52:57.670 --> 00:53:00.380
Anthony Taylor: That is a machine learning algorithm.

564
00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:06.410
Anthony Taylor: I'm looking at your pattern. And I'm responding, based on your patterns

565
00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:10.579
Anthony Taylor: versus, I'm looking at a number. Here's 5 things that match that

566
00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:23.520
Anthony Taylor: does. Everybody got the difference. Now, cause that's a hard thing to differentiate just you being able to differentiate a Bool's engine from a machine learning algorithm will put you ahead of about 80% of the data scientists I've ever met

567
00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:28.360
Anthony Taylor: cause half of them wanna make a rules engine into it out

568
00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:47.419
Baro, Sonja: when you get your packet of coupons in the mail from the grocery store that are things that you bought in the past or that they wanna then maybe it's kind of like the recommendation. But it's specifically to the things you buy.

569
00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:50.939
Anthony Taylor: Well, has it got your name on it, or does it say Grizzly?

570
00:53:52.400 --> 00:54:00.690
Baro, Sonja: No, it's well, it's off. A loyalty program is how? Okay? Well, then, yes, that would be specific. That is, definitely

571
00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:10.449
Anthony Taylor: and often cluster. Not necessarily, but it will often be clustering. Now let me ask you this. Take that question and step further. If it says resident

572
00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:13.390
Anthony Taylor: think machine learning was involved

573
00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:19.360
Baro, Sonja: could have been cause. If it's unlabeled, if they don't know.

574
00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:20.620
Kanouff, Christine: Okay.

575
00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:34.350
Anthony Taylor: it's regional. It is still using machine learning. It's looking at instead of looking at you, Sonya. I'm Gonna give you recommendations. I'm looking at you, Sonya. You live in this Zip code.

576
00:54:34.570 --> 00:54:39.419
Baro, Sonja: and the people in your Zip code are most likely to respond to X.

577
00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:45.689
Anthony Taylor: So I'm going to send fires to your Zip code that look like this

578
00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:53.690
Anthony Taylor: because I want you to respond. I want the best response possible, because Christine will tell you she don't care how many damn flyers she sends out.

579
00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:58.640
Anthony Taylor: She don't care right because they cost like a penny.

580
00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:02.950
Anthony Taylor: but if she gets 5 sales they made all their money back.

581
00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:04.959
Anthony Taylor: She gets 10. They doubled it.

582
00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:09.759
Clayton Graves: So another example would be like.

583
00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:20.939
Clayton Graves: Focusing your marketing for the jeep wrangler on call in Colorado, because cheap ownership, because everybody in Colorado has a deep framework.

584
00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:23.629
Anthony Taylor: We know it's true

585
00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:25.960
Anthony Taylor: and smoke pot right?

586
00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:33.680
Anthony Taylor:  it's all about Subaru in Colorado. I feel like

587
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:37.039
Anthony Taylor: I'm not gonna lie. Everybody in Texas has a trouble.

588
00:55:37.890 --> 00:55:45.199
Anthony Taylor: Everybody. Everybody. It's like every driveway. There's a truck. If there's not a truck, it's a California.

589
00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:51.460
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's pretty much what we found out, or Yink. we don't like Yankees.

590
00:55:52.330 --> 00:56:08.390
Kanouff, Christine: I think the thing that gets. So, you know, we're all getting bombarded with so much information, because if you look at click on, make a purchase on in any way, shape or form all these retailers have.

591
00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:22.679
Kanouff, Christine: They're all sharing their data, all of them. And they have these consortiums. And they hey, like one large analytics company, to get the data back. And they've all agreed to do this.

592
00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:25.030
Kanouff, Christine: So I mean, there is

593
00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:42.969
Kanouff, Christine: as anything you buy, touch, or whatever is going out to thousands of different types of companies cause they will find some random. Oh, we found that this person bought this and the other person in the data, but base now bought from us. So now they go, and they grab all that other company's data

594
00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:46.820
Kanouff, Christine: and files it down. And it's crazy

595
00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:51.769
Kanouff, Christine: how much I mean, you buy one thing, and there's no way.

596
00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:55.170
Anthony Taylor: Christine, we know everything.

597
00:56:55.890 --> 00:56:59.119
Kanouff, Christine: Alright. I told you guys to target pregnant story. Right?

598
00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:02.680
Anthony Taylor: Okay. that's one of my favorite ones.

599
00:57:03.310 --> 00:57:16.609
Anthony Taylor: Okay, anomaly detection is another use. Right? So this is 100%. I mean, you get in your bank account and you go and you buy something at a store you haven't bought at

600
00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:18.330
Anthony Taylor: very, very often.

601
00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:26.489
Anthony Taylor: Okay, like, you know me, I went to Academy. I bought something they're like, what are you doing? Buying stuff from a sport at good store.

602
00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:34.309
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So they call me up. Why did they call me up? Because some clustering algorithm went.

603
00:57:34.530 --> 00:57:36.899
Anthony Taylor: This is not normal for this, this person

604
00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:52.440
Anthony Taylor: doesn't fit the pattern. So let's just check. Alright. that's it. That's the whole story. Okay. alright. we're almost actually doing some work guys, I promise.

605
00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:55.989
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna be a break before we do anything.

606
00:57:56.260 --> 00:58:05.209
Anthony Taylor: so clustering is just basically grouping the data together. So how does it do that? Well. effectively, I think we have a pretty good definition here.

607
00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:09.959
Anthony Taylor: do we? Do we? Do we? No? Well, sort of

608
00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:14.180
Anthony Taylor: so basically, it's going. You're gonna put in all of your data points.

609
00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:21.489
Anthony Taylor: And we're going to explain the algorithm very detailed. But it's going to establish a center

610
00:58:22.770 --> 00:58:36.210
Anthony Taylor: all right. Now. The first.is the center. Is it gonna be that center the whole time? Absolutely not. As more dots come in. More data points come in. The center moves and moves, moves

611
00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:41.419
Anthony Taylor: at some point. depending on how many groups we tell it to make.

612
00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:49.339
Anthony Taylor: it goes. Okay? Well, if we need groups, here's the center of group one group 2, group 3, all of the points within

613
00:58:49.770 --> 00:58:53.519
Anthony Taylor: an algorithmic distance will be part of that group.

614
00:58:54.810 --> 00:58:59.579
Anthony Taylor: And that's basically how it works. We're gonna look at that. A little more detail. Alright.

615
00:58:59.770 --> 00:59:08.639
Anthony Taylor:  So centering helps determine the number of classes of groups we're going to talk about how to get the right number of groups in your data

616
00:59:08.830 --> 00:59:10.340
Anthony Taylor: in just a few minutes.

617
00:59:10.590 --> 00:59:21.560
Anthony Taylor:  the it improves the performance. So if we tell it how many groups it knows exactly what to do. It's going to run faster.

618
00:59:22.330 --> 00:59:23.270
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

619
00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:26.800
Anthony Taylor: I don't know why that's such a short slide. So here we go.

620
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:35.399
Anthony Taylor: So the first algorithm we're going to use pay needs. Pay means is super simple. incredibly powerful.

621
00:59:36.610 --> 00:59:39.850
Anthony Taylor: Alright. I'm actually glad they used to do this one after

622
00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:48.149
Anthony Taylor:  supervise and supervise has, like a gazillion models. Okay, unsupervised as like.

623
00:59:48.690 --> 00:59:51.020
Anthony Taylor: There's more than that. But these are the popular ones.

624
00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:53.500
Anthony Taylor: K means by far the most part.

625
00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:55.839
Anthony Taylor: So what does it do

626
00:59:55.920 --> 01:00:02.230
Anthony Taylor: so? Algorithm assigns points to the closest cluster center. How does it know the cluster center? Just like I explained.

627
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:08.199
Anthony Taylor: First dot that comes in. That's cluster 1 s dot that's cluster 2 third dot.

628
01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:13.780
Anthony Taylor: if we ask for 3, is cluster 3, and then, as it brings in more points.

629
01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:17.609
Anthony Taylor: that center starts to move away from each other.

630
01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:22.040
Anthony Taylor: Well, assuming they were close together. To begin with. okay.

631
01:00:25.770 --> 01:00:29.400
Anthony Taylor: Mike's got got some serious distractions going on.

632
01:00:29.850 --> 01:00:32.530
Anthony Taylor: Oh.

633
01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:35.799
michael mcpherson: anyway. And so these dots start.

634
01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:53.689
Anthony Taylor: the dots start moving away from each other until they become isolated clusters that make sense. And all of the data is processed. And you guys will get to see that. So here's an example of it. Actually, mark first one. Well, this is data points are here. So it's randomly selected to central.

635
01:00:54.280 --> 01:01:04.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay, each object is assigned to the closest centroid based on an algorithm that determines how far it's willing to go. And it's also based on how much data is there?

636
01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:20.390
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if there were, I mean, if there was this many rows or this many data points. then this might be accurate. But if there were like 10 million it could go further out or stay closer in depending on

637
01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:29.950
Anthony Taylor: Oh, my God! We'll get to that word in a minute. I just it just blanked on. Sorry. But anyway, so then the centroid was way up here.

638
01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:34.569
Anthony Taylor: Well, now, it's moved in closer to the center of all the points

639
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.410
Anthony Taylor: on both of these. So now more points come in.

640
01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:50.259
Anthony Taylor: Okay, then the centroid moves to the center of those points. and this keeps happening until all the data is processed and all the data has been clustered to a centroid.

641
01:01:51.590 --> 01:01:55.459
Anthony Taylor: That made, don't worry. If that made sense yet. Don't worry about.

642
01:01:55.690 --> 01:01:58.030
Anthony Taylor: Alright. We're gonna go

643
01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.300
Anthony Taylor: and make it make sense.

644
01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.500
Anthony Taylor: pet. There's the group

645
01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:09.300
Anthony Taylor: notes. I put all those in your

646
01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:22.200
Anthony Taylor: in your gitlab. By the way. for those that are interested in the notes that I created. They weren't all that deep. I don't usually make them too deep.

647
01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:27.899
Anthony Taylor: My brain is not picking. There it goes!

648
01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:29.490
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

649
01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:39.180
Anthony Taylor: Alright! Here we go gang. We haven't been here so long. I guess you guys have been in here a lot lately. But

650
01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:42.840
Anthony Taylor: me, I haven't been here in days.

651
01:02:44.290 --> 01:02:45.110
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

652
01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:49.879
Anthony Taylor: So if you guys don't recall sk, learn data sets

653
01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:53.200
Anthony Taylor: gives us the capability to either bring in data

654
01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:58.740
Anthony Taylor: using psychit learn or in this case, we're going to create data.

655
01:02:59.450 --> 01:03:02.060
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're gonna also bring in pandas.

656
01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:13.959
Anthony Taylor: and we're gonna run this make blobs method make blobs. We're going to pass in an X and a Y,

657
01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:22.040
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna have 3 centers. 2 features. And we're going to pass in a random state of one.

658
01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:34.859
Anthony Taylor: Okay, let's look at our X variables. Pretty exciting stuff, there, isn't it? Yeah, let's look at our shape. It's a hundred rows to value.

659
01:03:36.110 --> 01:03:37.030
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

660
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:41.330
Anthony Taylor: our Y is usually what we're trying to predict.

661
01:03:41.790 --> 01:03:47.969
Anthony Taylor: And you can see it's 0 1, 1, 2, 2, 1 one we don't really care about. Why, in space. If we're going to do plus.

662
01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:52.150
Anthony Taylor: okay. But if you know, there's 0 to 2,

663
01:03:52.210 --> 01:03:55.169
Anthony Taylor: so why is showing you the 3 clusters?

664
01:03:55.590 --> 01:04:00.250
Anthony Taylor: If we were to plot it, we would see it. But we don't really need that. So we don't care.

665
01:04:00.730 --> 01:04:03.750
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So let's take a look at our data. Now.

666
01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:06.859
Anthony Taylor: there's our data. Let's plot this out.

667
01:04:07.330 --> 01:04:10.989
Anthony Taylor: So this is all stuff you guys have done before. Nothing really exciting.

668
01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:20.760
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we have feature, one feature, 2. Feature, one feature 2 and our target. So our target is doing our color.

669
01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:30.590
Anthony Taylor: So 1, 2, 3 clusters, everyone great haven't done anything yet. All we've done is created some data. That's all. This is

670
01:04:31.790 --> 01:04:35.289
Anthony Taylor: alright. Now we're going to do one with 5,

671
01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:36.969
Anthony Taylor: that's all good.

672
01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:41.589
Anthony Taylor: We've just put it all in one pass. So now we have 5 plus.

673
01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:47.919
Anthony Taylor: This is a little harder to to differentiate. Do you agree? This really easy.

674
01:04:49.330 --> 01:04:51.250
Anthony Taylor: this not as easy.

675
01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:57.519
Anthony Taylor: Now realize it's colored because we told it? The answer.

676
01:04:57.690 --> 01:04:59.369
Anthony Taylor: But if we remove that.

677
01:05:03.050 --> 01:05:09.760
Anthony Taylor: do you see 5 clusters there? Kind of do cause you did a second ago? Right? But truth is, you wouldn't.

678
01:05:10.830 --> 01:05:14.250
Anthony Taylor: You might go. Well, maybe there's 2,

679
01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.519
Anthony Taylor: maybe there's 4

680
01:05:18.850 --> 01:05:19.810
Anthony Taylor: right?

681
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:23.920
Anthony Taylor: But that's what we have to learn. That's really it.

682
01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:28.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Well, good news is, there's another one. So this is just us making clusters.

683
01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:32.210
Anthony Taylor: It's exciting stuff. Yeah, Meredith.

684
01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:40.850
Meredith McCanse (she/her): can you say a little bit about like, what does the term target mean is that in this case, that's what we're trying to predict.

685
01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:43.890
Anthony Taylor: So why will.

686
01:05:44.350 --> 01:05:50.080
Anthony Taylor: in all of our machine learning classes, X will be the data we're going to use

687
01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:56.070
Anthony Taylor: to train our models to fit them. Why will be your target variable?

688
01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:10.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So in this case they gave us why? So we knew which blob was which. But when we do k-means we won't know this ahead of time.

689
01:06:10.890 --> 01:06:13.520
Anthony Taylor: We'll actually drop y because we don't want to use it.

690
01:06:14.550 --> 01:06:18.379
Anthony Taylor: All right. Make sense. The why is our target variable

691
01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:27.990
Anthony Taylor: in pretty much everything. I mean, it doesn't have to be called. Why, but pretty much. Everywhere you train on machine learning. It's X one. Okay.

692
01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:29.530
So

693
01:06:35.730 --> 01:06:44.800
Anthony Taylor: so we're bringing pandas this time. We're gonna bring in actual data. Take a look at it. So we have mobile app rating and personal banker rating.

694
01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:51.149
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I'm good with that. Let's do a scatter plot. See what it looks like. Whoa.

695
01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:53.949
Anthony Taylor: guys see any clusters there.

696
01:06:57.670 --> 01:07:04.449
Anthony Taylor: Now, right, this is where we're going to gain value from product like a needs.

697
01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:07.569
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we're gonna say.

698
01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:17.170
Anthony Taylor: import sk, learn import. K means. So because, does anybody remember the 3 magic words and machine learning? We've already talked about them a few times?

699
01:07:18.970 --> 01:07:23.099
Anthony Taylor: I'll give you a reminder. The first word is model

700
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:26.210
Baro, Sonja: fit predict

701
01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:28.210
Anthony Taylor: model fit for date.

702
01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:41.159
Anthony Taylor: So we got to select our model. That's the model portion we have to initialize our model with K-means initializing. It means you call it. You tell it how many clusters you want.

703
01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:43.539
Anthony Taylor: The rest of this stuff isn't really necessary.

704
01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:48.570
Anthony Taylor: but we're gonna do it to keep our. Are the the results

705
01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:58.339
Anthony Taylor: the same for all of us. That's why we're putting in a random state. Okay. so we run this, and we now have our model.

706
01:07:59.810 --> 01:08:02.719
Anthony Taylor: The next thing we got to do did it.

707
01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:07.649
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to fit it with all of our data from this data frame.

708
01:08:10.530 --> 01:08:12.760
Anthony Taylor: Who it's done

709
01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:15.649
Anthony Taylor: that was fast. Right?

710
01:08:17.069 --> 01:08:23.789
Anthony Taylor:  now, we can do a predict now with with the clustering algorithm.

711
01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:26.600
Anthony Taylor: the predict is basically going to show us.

712
01:08:26.609 --> 01:08:32.849
Anthony Taylor: I divided you data up. And this is one cluster, and this one goes to the other cluster

713
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.230
Anthony Taylor: if we plot it so we can copy it.

714
01:08:36.930 --> 01:08:49.929
Anthony Taylor: Oh, they're gonna this one's actually gonna show it in a data frame. Okay? So we can see which ones went to where. And then here, we can actually see the colored plot. Now look at the original.

715
01:08:52.899 --> 01:08:55.229
Anthony Taylor: and now you can see how it clustered it.

716
01:08:56.490 --> 01:08:59.659
Anthony Taylor: Okay. that's pretty cool. We got 2 plus

717
01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:02.470
Anthony Taylor: alright. So you see one.

718
01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:07.910
Anthony Taylor: and we can look at this. I mean, you could go through this and try to figure out why

719
01:09:07.979 --> 01:09:14.340
Anthony Taylor: I mean, this is 3 and 2.4 it went to 0. This is 2.9 2.7 went to one.

720
01:09:14.490 --> 01:09:18.979
Anthony Taylor: but then you got 2.9 3.3 went to one I don't even know.

721
01:09:19.399 --> 01:09:28.459
Anthony Taylor: But this is where you would get your data experts to come in and figure out why each cluster is, or just give a name to each cluster.

722
01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:31.080
Anthony Taylor: Once they give it a name. It has a label.

723
01:09:32.859 --> 01:09:33.680
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

724
01:09:34.029 --> 01:09:37.489
Anthony Taylor: And that's it, guys. So let's look at K-means. One more time

725
01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:42.359
Anthony Taylor: we loaded data? Yeah. Oh, yeah, time. Go ahead.

726
01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:52.919
Raugewitz, Tania: Just to better understand the clustering in this last example, it didn't really look like there was 2 clusters. Does it force the clustering?

727
01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:55.550
Anthony Taylor: That's such a great question.

728
01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:59.779
Raugewitz, Tania: So you forced it when you told it to make 2 customers. Okay.

729
01:10:00.330 --> 01:10:10.119
Anthony Taylor: okay, but we will. before the end of the day. Learn how to get the right number of clusters. because there might be 5 in there. You just don't know.

730
01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:14.139
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but right now we're telling it

731
01:10:14.530 --> 01:10:15.480
Anthony Taylor: 2 customers

732
01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:30.229
Anthony Taylor: so. And that that happens a lot like, if you know, if you're in marketing, marketing is like, I use this for marketing. So much. So marketing comes to me, and they say, You know what we want to figure out. Who is this this this, like? They already have the labels in their head

733
01:10:31.470 --> 01:10:34.829
Anthony Taylor: right? And they're like, we want 3 clusters. And I go. Okay.

734
01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:41.050
Anthony Taylor: Now, I will still do the step. You'll see later, where we determine that there might be 4 clusters there

735
01:10:41.150 --> 01:10:48.650
Anthony Taylor: which sometimes they care about. Sometimes they're like, really like, yep, there's a whole nother group here. You're not even looking.

736
01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:50.679
Anthony Taylor: And then they're like.

737
01:10:50.770 --> 01:10:54.980
Anthony Taylor: Okay, well, we want to see that. And then they look at. But yeah.

738
01:10:55.550 --> 01:11:01.169
Anthony Taylor: so so to to create our K-means. We loaded some data to create our K-means.

739
01:11:01.470 --> 01:11:04.640
Anthony Taylor: We we just tell it how many clusters.

740
01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:07.559
Clayton Graves: So if you were to make a model that

741
01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:16.340
Clayton Graves: identifies whether something is a potato or not a potato. You would know in that instance that there was just 2 clusters

742
01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:23.850
Anthony Taylor: potato and not potato. Yes, yeah, but that's a classification. But yes, I mean, if you threw in your data

743
01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:28.830
Anthony Taylor: that you have data that identifies potatoes and not potatoes. But it's not labeled

744
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:37.640
Clayton Graves: right. No, sir, not at all. Clustering is I don't have the label.

745
01:11:37.650 --> 01:11:43.269
Anthony Taylor: I mean. I guess I could see your statement, aren't we classifying? If we're giving them labels, though

746
01:11:43.690 --> 01:11:48.569
Anthony Taylor: in theory. But the idea is that we don't know what those classifications are yet

747
01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:53.410
Anthony Taylor: when we do this. But yeah, okay.

748
01:11:53.670 --> 01:12:01.989
Anthony Taylor: so anyway, so the the minimum you need is this. go ahead and add this stuff just to keep it consistent. But this is what's important.

749
01:12:03.150 --> 01:12:04.160
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

750
01:12:04.210 --> 01:12:08.720
Anthony Taylor: And then, just to fit, predict, chart or scatter plotted out. You're done

751
01:12:10.130 --> 01:12:13.819
Anthony Taylor: okay, for now we're gonna do more. But this is your first exercise.

752
01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:16.380
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so let's go look at the first exercise.

753
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.320
Anthony Taylor: I think we have time to do one exercise. So you're going to read in some data.

754
01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:24.480
Anthony Taylor: Let's

755
01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:29.160
Anthony Taylor: you ask

756
01:12:32.450 --> 01:12:37.629
Anthony Taylor:  Let's see if they at least gave it to you.

757
01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:43.000
Anthony Taylor: Oh, good. Oh.

758
01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:51.620
Anthony Taylor: okay. alright. So you're gonna read in some data. You're gonna use this cool function. They gave you to alter this column.

759
01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:55.939
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And so you should end up with something like this.

760
01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:58.989
Anthony Taylor: This is, gonna make take you back to pandas guys.

761
01:12:59.190 --> 01:13:01.800
Anthony Taylor:  and then

762
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:08.170
Anthony Taylor: you're going to initialize your K-means model. They want you to do 2 clusters. fit it, predict it.

763
01:13:09.250 --> 01:13:12.879
Anthony Taylor: and then do another one with 3 clusters. Fit it, predict it.

764
01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:15.040
Anthony Taylor: and then.

765
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:18.730
Anthony Taylor: oh.

766
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:24.480
Anthony Taylor: I don't care if you guys do this data frame piece, you can. I'm more interested in in you guys doing

767
01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:28.310
Anthony Taylor: the scatterplot for this. If you want to try this, go right ahead.

768
01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:31.050
Anthony Taylor: I'm guessing they must be giving you a lot of time.

769
01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:44.310
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, well. 20 min. Think you guys might be okay. If not, don't worry. We'll go through it all.

770
01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:53.980
Anthony Taylor:  Welcome back everybody. So how was that activity? It's pretty tough, huh?

771
01:13:56.690 --> 01:13:59.509
Anthony Taylor: Anybody think it was tough. Curry nodded.

772
01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:01.490
Anthony Taylor: Hmm.

773
01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:05.190
Anthony Taylor: anybody get it done, Matt?

774
01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:10.520
Dipinto, Matt: Yeah, we made it to the end. What we don't understand is.

775
01:14:10.850 --> 01:14:13.720
Dipinto, Matt: what is what is this data

776
01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:18.769
Anthony Taylor: I love that I have no idea. Do we need to look at it and see? Let's go look

777
01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:24.769
Dipinto, Matt: scaled. Oh, it's scaled data. So it's kinda hard to go, but

778
01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:38.109
Dipinto, Matt: So I went to the reference that they included in the read me for what? The actual yeah, it's supposed to be a bunch of positive values. So like this, data is.

779
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:43.329
Dipinto, Matt: we haven't talked about scaling yet.

780
01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:46.130
Anthony Taylor: So it does say, scale data.

781
01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:52.609
Anthony Taylor: So yeah. yeah, scale data is data that has been.

782
01:14:52.840 --> 01:15:03.570
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna apply an algorithm to it, and it'll be. you know it. You'll understand when we get to it. Trust, I've done it all right. You had to trust me because I don't want to explain it yet.

783
01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:09.630
Anthony Taylor: I know that doesn't seem nice, but we are gonna really get into it. So let's continue.

784
01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:15.289
Anthony Taylor: We got it bringing in our Panda's in our model.

785
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:19.979
Anthony Taylor: our data. Very nice. Yeah, it's ugly data. I get it.

786
01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:21.440
Kanouff, Christine: Are you sharing

787
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:28.420
Anthony Taylor: no cause. I thought it'd be way more interesting to try to explain every single thing

788
01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:32.380
Anthony Taylor: alright. So I'm gonna make it easy on myself and share.

789
01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:34.039
Anthony Taylor: Thank you for reminding.

790
01:15:34.290 --> 01:15:41.260
Anthony Taylor: So here's our data. Pretty cool. Nothing exciting. There, take a quick look at the info on it. Yay.

791
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:47.260
Anthony Taylor: not much to say. Right? 440 rows

792
01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:49.509
Kanouff, Christine: looks like they're all populated.

793
01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:50.580
Anthony Taylor: We're good.

794
01:15:52.130 --> 01:16:01.929
Anthony Taylor: So this in code method, in code method that they provided you, it's really just to make the the target value.

795
01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:09.180
Anthony Taylor: make a little more sense in it when we plot it. That's it. You can't plot the word hotel risk. Ca.

796
01:16:09.670 --> 01:16:16.699
Anthony Taylor: okay, so they just did this so that you would have it as a number, you will find that most machine learning algorithms

797
01:16:16.890 --> 01:16:18.840
Anthony Taylor: require

798
01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:24.250
Anthony Taylor: numbers makes sense right? Cause they're doing

799
01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:26.830
Anthony Taylor: math.

800
01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:29.230
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

801
01:16:29.530 --> 01:16:37.249
Anthony Taylor:  So once we've done that, we're going to use that method and apply it. Sorry

802
01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:47.109
Anthony Taylor: we're going to use our function to apply it to method. I had to change my wording so that made a little more sense. And then that gives us

803
01:16:48.290 --> 01:16:50.900
a fail, because I didn't actually run

804
01:16:51.130 --> 01:16:52.050
Anthony Taylor: the method.

805
01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:59.810
Anthony Taylor: There we go. So now we see that instead of retail and hotel rest, rest, cafe is actually a number

806
01:17:02.190 --> 01:17:09.870
Anthony Taylor: so now that we have a data frame, we can do our first K-means model, we're going to do 2 clusters. We're gonna fit it.

807
01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:17.129
Anthony Taylor: We're going to take our prediction and put it into a column and print it out.

808
01:17:17.250 --> 01:17:21.840
Anthony Taylor: So this is just because we said 2 clusters, the only 2 values could be 0 and one

809
01:17:23.330 --> 01:17:28.779
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna do it again. But this time with 3, nothing's different. Everything's the same except

810
01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:30.760
Anthony Taylor: we changed it to 3

811
01:17:30.990 --> 01:17:32.010
Anthony Taylor: testers.

812
01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:39.970
Meredith McCanse (she/her): What different people get different results for this, or should everybody's results? So you did not use a random state? Yes, absolutely you will.

813
01:17:41.170 --> 01:17:50.820
Anthony Taylor: So that's why we use random state when I'm showing you in the classroom. right? Cause that way, it's always the same. But here no, we did not use random state.

814
01:17:52.140 --> 01:18:00.920
Anthony Taylor: so so you will see different results. Don't don't stress about that. Okay, so yeah. So here we now we have.

815
01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:06.539
Anthony Taylor: Since we did 3, we should have 3 clusters. Hold on.

816
01:18:07.090 --> 01:18:09.030
Anthony Taylor: I don't see it. Where's it at?

817
01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:12.160
Anthony Taylor: I don't see a 2 in there which is not abnormal.

818
01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:16.429
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I mean, if there isn't 3 clusters there, there is 3 clusters there.

819
01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:22.930
Baro, Sonja: You haven't seen one. Yeah, like fourth or fifth line down second from the right.

820
01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:26.859
Anthony Taylor: I see it. Thank goodness.

821
01:18:26.970 --> 01:18:29.070
Baro, Sonja: okay.

822
01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:32.370
Baro, Sonja: alright. So now that we have that, we're gonna sorry.

823
01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:34.440
Baro, Sonja: I said you found wall, though.

824
01:18:34.730 --> 01:18:38.270
Anthony Taylor: I know that was pretty impressive. So yeah, that was

825
01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:44.569
Anthony Taylor: okay. I have trouble reading my phone at night period. So that was really tough.

826
01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:52.720
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna make a copy of a data frame. Just so we can slice it up. We're gonna slice. We're gonna take our predictions.

827
01:18:52.830 --> 01:18:54.449
Anthony Taylor: throw em in there.

828
01:18:55.070 --> 01:19:01.469
Anthony Taylor: our key. 3 convictions. Put them in there, take a look at our data. So here we can see what

829
01:19:01.490 --> 01:19:04.009
Anthony Taylor: 2 clusters did, what 3 clusters did.

830
01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:06.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so interesting

831
01:19:07.670 --> 01:19:13.390
Anthony Taylor: that all of these top 5 were all the first cluster for both didn't make a difference which one

832
01:19:13.410 --> 01:19:14.869
Anthony Taylor: does that mean anything?

833
01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:22.269
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So here we'll plot this is just the 2 cluster

834
01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:23.720
Anthony Taylor: version.

835
01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:24.870
E

836
01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:28.490
Anthony Taylor: looks like that it's not very exciting.

837
01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:30.280
Anthony Taylor: but it's 2 clusters.

838
01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:33.689
Meredith McCanse (she/her): But can you go back up and show the code on that?

839
01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:35.219
Anthony Taylor: Oh, for the plot?

840
01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:40.929
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So we basically just plotted, frozen, and grocery, and the prediction.

841
01:19:41.330 --> 01:19:47.049
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So the C, the C variable is what tell is where you're telling it. The 2 clusters

842
01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:54.389
Meredith McCanse (she/her): it's using 0 and one to determine the color.

843
01:19:54.690 --> 01:19:58.600
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay, sorry. Never mind you. You answered it. Thank you.

844
01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:03.440
Anthony Taylor: There you go. C is for color. That's how we get it to do this cute little

845
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:11.199
Anthony Taylor: color thing. Okay? And then we're gonna do the same thing except this time. We're gonna plot the 3 cluster model.

846
01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:18.880
Anthony Taylor: And where's that third. Where's that extra dot? It's right there.

847
01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:24.650
Anthony Taylor: that's pretty exciting stuff. Yeah. Bye.

848
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:31.540
michael mcpherson: when I got to, when I got there, the first graph and the second graph were identical.

849
01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:38.400
michael mcpherson: And then they are identical except the color. That's okay.

850
01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:43.320
Anthony Taylor: That's perfectly acceptable. Because you get a different random state.

851
01:20:43.550 --> 01:20:47.239
Anthony Taylor: It should be similar. I don't know about totally different, but

852
01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:48.630
michael mcpherson: but

853
01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:53.339
michael mcpherson: I had 3 clusters on the top graph, and the second, and then I

854
01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:54.670
michael mcpherson: rerant.

855
01:20:55.300 --> 01:20:59.099
michael mcpherson: restarted the kernel and reran it. And then it came out

856
01:20:59.370 --> 01:21:00.900
michael mcpherson: with writing.

857
01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:04.539
michael mcpherson: I didn't change anything. I just rebranded.

858
01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:08.530
Anthony Taylor: That's how the random state thing works all the time.

859
01:21:08.810 --> 01:21:14.159
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I mean, like, I'm sure yours looks different than mine. Some of you probably got more than one to.

860
01:21:15.490 --> 01:21:16.859
michael mcpherson: Yeah, right?

861
01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:28.350
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, totally believe it. Random state makes a difference. Which is why we don't. Why, why, we're careful with random state. Because if we want to repeat something, we should put Random stated

862
01:21:29.190 --> 01:21:30.710
Anthony Taylor: alright, but

863
01:21:31.330 --> 01:21:36.050
Anthony Taylor: it's sometimes good not to do it, because then you get to see different views of the same thing.

864
01:21:37.210 --> 01:21:38.519
Anthony Taylor: Okay, yeah, Eric.

865
01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:42.429
Meredith McCanse (she/her): will you say again what the random state does again

866
01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:53.279
Anthony Taylor: random state just sets the speed to the randomized. So if we all set the same speed. when it does a random number, we will all get the same random number.

867
01:21:54.250 --> 01:22:01.819
Anthony Taylor: and is the seed because you said equals one is that the it could be equals anything, any number. As long as we say the same, though.

868
01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:07.760
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So if you said one and I said 2, we get different results. We would get different results.

869
01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:11.949
Anthony Taylor: But if I then change it to 2, I'd get the same as you

870
01:22:12.090 --> 01:22:28.059
Meredith McCanse (she/her): got it. So it's not the fact. So much is okay. Got it? Thank you. Yeah, it's it's it is entirely meant to make it. We use it again. I need a lot. You'll see it in everything I show you, because when you run what I'm showing you. I want you to get the same result.

871
01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:34.750
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but it's not always the way we do it in the field. Fact, I would say our

872
01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:38.199
Anthony Taylor: rarely use it except for when I'm testing, yeah, my.

873
01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:44.780
michael mcpherson: where in the code do you put that random state? Can you initialize the model?

874
01:22:46.370 --> 01:22:48.909
Anthony Taylor: So when we did the clusters

875
01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:50.660
michael mcpherson: right here.

876
01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:52.590
Anthony Taylor: you would do random state.

877
01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:59.189
Anthony Taylor: you would do comma random state equals. And then just put a number in.

878
01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:02.510
michael mcpherson: Okay, alright, perfect thanks.

879
01:23:02.930 --> 01:23:12.980
Anthony Taylor: Not a problem. That's good. Good questions. Okay? So there was a question at the end. Do you know any relevant differences between the 2 models?

880
01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:19.330
Anthony Taylor: Anybody want to answer that

881
01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:28.239
Meredith McCanse (she/her): it seems like one of them had more data points than another like it doesn't

882
01:23:28.930 --> 01:23:31.290
Meredith McCanse (she/her): totally seen evenly split.

883
01:23:33.210 --> 01:23:43.879
Anthony Taylor: Oh, you mean the the clusters? Well, then, they don't have to be evenly split. Remember, it's not trying to even split them. It's trying to find the ones that are the correct distance from the centroid.

884
01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:46.379
Anthony Taylor: So you could have 2

885
01:23:46.730 --> 01:23:50.710
Anthony Taylor: right in Group 2 and 500 in group. What

886
01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:53.669
Anthony Taylor: if that's way the clusters work?

887
01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:58.530
Anthony Taylor: So it's not about evenly splitting. In fact, in the 3 cluster one, we only had one.

888
01:23:59.650 --> 01:24:00.960
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay, right?

889
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:06.450
Anthony Taylor: So. But no, that's good. That's good. So the observation here to me, these are practically identical.

890
01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:08.630
Anthony Taylor: By going to 3. We gain that.

891
01:24:09.850 --> 01:24:13.950
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we might want to go. Look at this point. See why it's different. But

892
01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:17.590
Anthony Taylor: it didn't give us any benefit. But this is qualitative.

893
01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:20.189
Anthony Taylor: We really need a better way to know

894
01:24:21.530 --> 01:24:30.470
Anthony Taylor: what the right number of clusters is. Okay, and after break we will find out alright. So I will see you guys at 8 30

895
01:24:40.030 --> 01:24:42.400
Anthony Taylor: so much excitement.

896
01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:54.619
Anthony Taylor: And, by the way, whoever I think, was either Clayton or Mike, that was saying, Yeah, I'm like, we sat down. We started writing, and then it was like, How do I do that again? That's like every single day at work

897
01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:57.630
Kanouff, Christine: honest to God. That's just like we do work every day.

898
01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:00.980
Anthony Taylor: It's like, Oh, I need to do this. The key

899
01:25:02.110 --> 01:25:03.919
Raugewitz, Tania: that's good to know is to

900
01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:05.640
Anthony Taylor: is to learn

901
01:25:05.650 --> 01:25:09.089
Anthony Taylor: that what you need to do so that you know, to go find

902
01:25:10.150 --> 01:25:17.530
Anthony Taylor: right? It's like, I've said that to you guys before. It's all about knowing what to look for.

903
01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:19.110
Anthony Taylor: So

904
01:25:20.110 --> 01:25:22.340
Anthony Taylor: anyway, I can.

905
01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:26.360
Anthony Taylor: Let's do an everyone. Do. I know you guys love everyone do.

906
01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:32.530
Anthony Taylor: and I'm sure you missed them. Cause you guys have not been doin. Everyone's dues

907
01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:38.080
Anthony Taylor: exchange.

908
01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:44.939
Anthony Taylor: So before we do it, let's look at the readme. There's nothing there. So let's just jump right in.

909
01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:49.960
Anthony Taylor: Alright. They give us this. That's nice of them.

910
01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:58.370
Anthony Taylor: And now it tells us to load the data. So first, where is our what is our data.

911
01:25:58.510 --> 01:26:03.009
Anthony Taylor: It is customer shopping scale or whatever.

912
01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:09.030
Anthony Taylor: I don't think I need that much.

913
01:26:11.150 --> 01:26:13.270
Anthony Taylor: Well. alright.

914
01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:19.999
Anthony Taylor: So let's read this in to a data frame

915
01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:23.240
customers

916
01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:27.110
Anthony Taylor: underscore shopping underscore. Yeah.

917
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:32.450
Anthony Taylor: Equals PD. Dot read dot CSV. Boom.

918
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:39.149
Anthony Taylor: and then we'll take a peek at it.

919
01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:47.940
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Do you need to tell it the resources folder.

920
01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:58.430
Anthony Taylor:  I do, dog got it! That's a good catch. Who caught that? Who was that?

921
01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:00.560
Anthony Taylor: Samaria's? Yep.

922
01:27:00.910 --> 01:27:04.440
Dipinto, Matt: Meredith would also like you to make it read Underscore Csv.

923
01:27:04.530 --> 01:27:06.089
Dipinto, Matt: She just didn't want to say it out loud.

924
01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:08.860
Kanouff, Christine: Oh. but

925
01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:10.380
oh, cool!

926
01:27:15.060 --> 01:27:17.250
Anthony Taylor: Was that your puppy talk in there, Matt?

927
01:27:18.340 --> 01:27:19.459
Dipinto, Matt: She's needy.

928
01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:23.870
Anthony Taylor: Oh.

929
01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:30.560
Anthony Taylor: okay. So now we got our data frame. That looks good, right? This looks just like that one we were looking at

930
01:27:30.890 --> 01:27:34.380
Anthony Taylor: earlier. Nice of them to give us the encode method. Again.

931
01:27:34.570 --> 01:27:43.050
Anthony Taylor: we like that. So basically guys, just so you understand, we're basically gonna run the exact same code we did in the last example.

932
01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:45.250
Anthony Taylor: Alright, but

933
01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:47.449
Anthony Taylor: here's where it's going chain

934
01:27:47.770 --> 01:27:51.980
Anthony Taylor: we're going to. Oh, there was a little lecture with this. Let me show you this little lecture.

935
01:27:56.410 --> 01:27:58.690
Anthony Taylor: Alright, So

936
01:27:59.110 --> 01:28:03.270
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna stop where we were, which is where we ended the last active. Okay.

937
01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:06.660
Anthony Taylor: so clustering optimization just is

938
01:28:07.090 --> 01:28:10.490
Anthony Taylor: to put it simply, you can look at all this stuff. All you want.

939
01:28:10.810 --> 01:28:15.960
Anthony Taylor: The bottom line is we want the right number of clusters for our data.

940
01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:19.440
Anthony Taylor: What is the optimal number?

941
01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:28.880
Anthony Taylor: Now, again. I gave you guys the example where you might run into a situation where someone comes to you and says, there's this many, even if they say that you should do this.

942
01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:43.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Cause like I said, marketing might go. Well, we have marketing segments. We want you to. Okay, then you do their 3. And then you do this exercise. We're about to. And you go. You know, there's actually 4, or there's actually 5,

943
01:28:44.430 --> 01:28:45.250
Anthony Taylor: 10.

944
01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:48.360
Anthony Taylor: Right always blows them all.

945
01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:56.650
Anthony Taylor:  So anyway. So this is what's important. We're going to get that right number for the in cluster variable.

946
01:28:56.990 --> 01:28:58.780
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

947
01:28:58.810 --> 01:29:00.829
Anthony Taylor: that's pretty much it. Okay.

948
01:29:00.910 --> 01:29:02.850
Anthony Taylor: so how do you know the optimal number?

949
01:29:04.270 --> 01:29:05.150
Anthony Taylor: Well.

950
01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:12.009
Anthony Taylor: one of the challenges working with unlabeled data is, we just don't know. So we have what's called the elbow myth.

951
01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:19.890
Anthony Taylor: So the elbow method were going to run the K-means algorithm for

952
01:29:20.610 --> 01:29:30.959
Anthony Taylor: as many clusters as we can think it could be. So maybe we'll start with one. Well, not 1, 2, and go up to maybe 10.

953
01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:36.270
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And as we do it, we're gonna plot.

954
01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:48.750
Anthony Taylor: What we're looking for is we're basically going to plot the inertia alright, which is basically how fast this value is changing effectively.

955
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:56.029
Anthony Taylor:  so what we're looking for is this beginning of a flattening?

956
01:29:56.970 --> 01:30:00.069
Anthony Taylor: Now you could argue, this is beginning to flatten 2.

957
01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:02.929
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But in this case

958
01:30:03.150 --> 01:30:07.839
Anthony Taylor: this would probably be the one we would look at. So the elbow

959
01:30:09.190 --> 01:30:10.509
Anthony Taylor: looking for the elbow

960
01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:15.510
Anthony Taylor: where it starts the flat. Okay?

961
01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:26.419
Anthony Taylor:  so here, same one. So this one you can see. So the optimal optimal value of K for this example is a 3.

962
01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:28.630
Anthony Taylor: Could you look at 4? Sure.

963
01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:35.810
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Could you look at 5? Sure, it's pretty flat, though, at this point there's like no change. There's no point.

964
01:30:36.130 --> 01:30:39.779
Anthony Taylor: but between 3 and 5 is a little bit.

965
01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:44.600
Anthony Taylor: But clearly this angle has changed to be mostly flat.

966
01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:48.559
Anthony Taylor: Alright. and that's it.

967
01:30:48.690 --> 01:30:54.459
Anthony Taylor: That's pretty much it.  So inertia is usually what we use to do this.

968
01:30:54.560 --> 01:31:05.450
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So it's the sum of the square distances of samples to their closest cluster center, and I'll show you I have a good picture of this somewhere. Here. It is. So this is a high inertia. This is a high inertia.

969
01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:08.570
Anthony Taylor: low inertia. So what does that mean? So

970
01:31:08.650 --> 01:31:18.670
Anthony Taylor: when we start thinking about the cluster right. the inertia will become lower as the clusters become type.

971
01:31:20.890 --> 01:31:35.359
Anthony Taylor: Got it. So when we start we have a higher, because we have like 2, and there's dots everywhere. and then we like, oh, let's break it in 3. And now, all of a sudden, we got dots that are closer to that center point 40, my God! Now we're super tight.

972
01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:41.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay. 5. And now we don't have anything pretty much. It's just a couple of dots.

973
01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:44.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Well, that's inertia.

974
01:31:45.030 --> 01:31:48.219
Anthony Taylor: Alright of a vamp. That's how it works. So

975
01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:56.599
Anthony Taylor: now you might be thinking, well, that looks hard to to do. But it's really not. So first, I'm gonna do is we're gonna create

976
01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:00.630
Anthony Taylor: an empty list. That's it.

977
01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:08.219
Anthony Taylor: That's going to hold all of our inertia values. Now let's create a variable that we're going to use for our cluster count.

978
01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:13.589
Anthony Taylor: So we'll just do. We'll make a list, and we'll do range

979
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:14.949
Anthony Taylor: one to 11.

980
01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:17.620
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So do range one.

981
01:32:17.820 --> 01:32:18.579
Anthony Taylor: 2 of that.

982
01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:24.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it is possible to have a one cluster cluster, but it's kind of weird.

983
01:32:26.130 --> 01:32:36.879
Anthony Taylor: So okay, so now that we have that we can do. Oh, wait, I guess I should put that cell zip it. So now, we're gonna create a for loop. So we're gonna say, for I in.

984
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:40.040
Anthony Taylor: okay, so we're gonna loop through these numbers.

985
01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:45.469
Anthony Taylor: I want to select the model and initialize it.

986
01:32:49.630 --> 01:32:52.990
Anthony Taylor: And I want to put what under clusters.

987
01:32:55.890 --> 01:32:56.840
Anthony Taylor: what value?

988
01:32:57.670 --> 01:32:58.570
Gebrekristos, Hafton: K,

989
01:32:59.300 --> 01:33:00.290
Anthony Taylor: okay.

990
01:33:01.230 --> 01:33:02.050
Dipinto, Matt: aye.

991
01:33:02.810 --> 01:33:06.870
Anthony Taylor: I right? Cause it's gonna iterate. I is gonna count. Yeah.

992
01:33:07.050 --> 01:33:11.339
Anthony Taylor: So so the first one is will be one, then 2, then 3, the 4, 5.

993
01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:16.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now we ask you an honest question. Is random state important here?

994
01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:25.580
Anthony Taylor: God, it!

995
01:33:26.990 --> 01:33:28.050
Anthony Taylor: There it is.

996
01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:32.509
Anthony Taylor: What do you guys think it's random state important here.

997
01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:34.070
Anthony Taylor: and why

998
01:33:40.100 --> 01:33:41.570
Anthony Taylor: nobody wants to guess.

999
01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:44.140
Dipinto, Matt: I don't think it's important.

1000
01:33:44.950 --> 01:33:46.490
Anthony Taylor: You don't really

1001
01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:49.690
Dipinto, Matt: be guys.

1002
01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:54.710
Dipinto, Matt: you're just gonna force it into some given solution. But it doesn't make it the right solution.

1003
01:33:55.850 --> 01:33:57.150
Anthony Taylor: That is true.

1004
01:33:57.830 --> 01:34:01.640
Anthony Taylor:  I would say. So. So here's

1005
01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:07.139
Dipinto, Matt: but for your port. Yeah, okay, okay, never mind. Yes, definitely important.

1006
01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:16.619
Anthony Taylor: maybe. Okay. I think you would still get an accurate read without it. But I think you will get a more consistent. Read with it

1007
01:34:17.150 --> 01:34:21.679
Anthony Taylor: right? III don't think I know right. So if we run this without it.

1008
01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:27.359
Anthony Taylor: it might be a little weird and might not get the best output. But when you run it with it

1009
01:34:27.970 --> 01:34:35.900
Anthony Taylor: it's going to give you consistent results. They and the only thing that's going to change is the cluster. So what's important here

1010
01:34:35.970 --> 01:34:40.339
Anthony Taylor: is that we are changing as few variables as possible.

1011
01:34:40.970 --> 01:34:44.620
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and that'll be important as we go through machine learning.

1012
01:34:44.650 --> 01:34:51.289
Anthony Taylor: So okay, so I've selected my model. I've initialized it with whatever count I'm on.

1013
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:56.190
Anthony Taylor: I fit it to the data. And now I'm going to take the inertia value

1014
01:34:56.490 --> 01:35:01.760
Anthony Taylor: and append it to my inertia list. So it is model.

1015
01:35:02.090 --> 01:35:04.250
Anthony Taylor: Got a nurse shop

1016
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:11.989
Anthony Taylor: thunder School. Alright, that's the value I'm looking for. So I can run this now.

1017
01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:19.199
Anthony Taylor: and it's gonna go brrr, and do all that. So now let's run all of those models.

1018
01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:23.190
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I mean, we could just print inertia

1019
01:35:23.970 --> 01:35:26.910
Anthony Taylor: from our list up there and see the nurses.

1020
01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:30.679
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Technically, yeah, I mean, this is great.

1021
01:35:30.890 --> 01:35:37.140
Anthony Taylor: But you can't really tell a whole lot of this yet. I mean, you could get a good idea, maybe. But so let's

1022
01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:40.639
Anthony Taylor: make this a little easier to read.

1023
01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:45.329
Anthony Taylor: So let's create a dictionary called Elbow data.

1024
01:35:47.210 --> 01:35:55.180
Anthony Taylor: And in the dictionary, we're gonna have the K value. which is online. Okay?

1025
01:35:56.670 --> 01:35:58.909
Anthony Taylor: And we're going to have the inertia out.

1026
01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:03.550
Anthony Taylor: okay.

1027
01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:09.970
Anthony Taylor: which is the list for inertia. So this is why

1028
01:36:11.210 --> 01:36:12.579
Anthony Taylor: I did this here.

1029
01:36:14.580 --> 01:36:27.000
Anthony Taylor: because I knew I was going to create a dictionary, and I needed the K value. And I needed the inertia value in a list. so that when I create this dictionary I'll be able to create a data frame from.

1030
01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:31.980
Anthony Taylor: So this is going to be 0 through 10. And this is going to be.

1031
01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:37.989
Anthony Taylor: I'm sorry one through 10. And this is gonna be the inertia values from our models.

1032
01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:40.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So now we can create a data frame

1033
01:36:53.310 --> 01:36:56.429
Anthony Taylor: alright. And then we take a look at it and see what it looks like.

1034
01:37:04.110 --> 01:37:17.100
Anthony Taylor: alright looks good. Okay. alright. Now, let's plot. So this is. This is where we're going to see our visual elbow. In fact, let's get rid of this hand. Real quick

1035
01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:22.330
Anthony Taylor: jelly, came Rosy. But we can look at this and

1036
01:37:23.090 --> 01:37:24.879
start to see

1037
01:37:25.530 --> 01:37:28.410
Anthony Taylor: we can. We could do a quantitative.

1038
01:37:29.470 --> 01:37:31.599
Anthony Taylor: Yes, just looking at this data.

1039
01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:35.849
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so what you what am I looking for?

1040
01:37:36.290 --> 01:37:37.380
Anthony Taylor: Basically.

1041
01:37:42.270 --> 01:37:51.830
Anthony Taylor: right? Remember, center point? Not quite, Natalie, but good thinking

1042
01:37:52.570 --> 01:37:57.199
Anthony Taylor: exactly. So we wanna look at the difference how much difference between each group.

1043
01:37:57.780 --> 01:38:06.530
Anthony Taylor: right? And what we're looking for is for the difference to pretty significantly lower, and then not lower by a lot.

1044
01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:10.750
Baro, Sonja: Alright. So so here you see 7 to 3. That's what

1045
01:38:11.070 --> 01:38:15.290
Anthony Taylor: 300 ish. But then it's only 7.

1046
01:38:17.250 --> 01:38:22.259
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then after that, it's like yeah 150 ish, and then it's

1047
01:38:22.990 --> 01:38:23.850
you know.

1048
01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:25.749
Anthony Taylor: not even a hundred.

1049
01:38:26.150 --> 01:38:35.979
Anthony Taylor: not even a hundred, not even a hundred, not even a hundred. Alright! So we could make a pretty good guess that it's going to be one of these values.

1050
01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:38.920
Anthony Taylor: I would

1051
01:38:39.290 --> 01:38:41.470
Anthony Taylor: alright. So let's do our plot

1052
01:38:41.490 --> 01:38:45.630
Anthony Taylor: and be sure. So remember, since we're using

1053
01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:50.480
Anthony Taylor: pandas, this is actually a pretty easy plot to make.

1054
01:38:50.610 --> 01:38:56.650
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we just do plot line. And we just pass in our X equals K

1055
01:38:59.630 --> 01:39:00.980
Anthony Taylor: are why

1056
01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:02.320
schools

1057
01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:03.540
Anthony Taylor: inertia.

1058
01:39:06.060 --> 01:39:07.460
Anthony Taylor: And

1059
01:39:09.890 --> 01:39:20.020
Anthony Taylor: we okay, let's give it a title. That's it. By the way. I don't know anybody that would put a title on a elbow curve looking for cluster counts.

1060
01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:23.149
Anthony Taylor: But I guess we do that because, you know.

1061
01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:26.520
Anthony Taylor: that's what our curriculum team would do.

1062
01:39:27.630 --> 01:39:30.070
Anthony Taylor: Elbow curve. Okay?

1063
01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:34.419
Anthony Taylor: And then we can have ticks in there, too, if we want to. Ticks, is probably good idea.

1064
01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:36.590
Anthony Taylor: so we'll do. X ticks

1065
01:39:37.010 --> 01:39:38.580
Anthony Taylor: equals A,

1066
01:39:39.630 --> 01:39:47.369
Anthony Taylor: and I missed something. What is this? Darn it, as you know? Why, there's no equals there. It's just a period.

1067
01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:48.719
Anthony Taylor: I'll take that one

1068
01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:54.039
Anthony Taylor: alright. So this looks ugly pretty much but

1069
01:39:54.220 --> 01:39:55.170
Anthony Taylor: there you go.

1070
01:39:56.470 --> 01:40:00.070
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But which one do you think it is here?

1071
01:40:04.540 --> 01:40:07.120
Anthony Taylor: I still, I still kind of feel like

1072
01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:10.940
Anthony Taylor: might be for 3 or 4.

1073
01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:18.420
Anthony Taylor: All right. So let's do, let's do another quantitative check. We did it visually. We kind of like, did it in our heads.

1074
01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:20.250
Anthony Taylor: Let's do

1075
01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:24.950
Anthony Taylor:  let's do.

1076
01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:28.370
Anthony Taylor: Let's create elbow data

1077
01:40:32.170 --> 01:40:33.930
Anthony Taylor: equals. K.

1078
01:40:34.850 --> 01:40:35.600
No.

1079
01:40:35.850 --> 01:40:37.990
Anthony Taylor: How about data? What?

1080
01:40:39.460 --> 01:40:45.959
Anthony Taylor: Oh, sorry. K equals elbow data. K got it. I'm like that. Don't make any sense. But yeah.

1081
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:49.350
Anthony Taylor: okay.

1082
01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:52.870
Anthony Taylor: And from here we're going to do inertia

1083
01:40:57.190 --> 01:40:58.430
Anthony Taylor: equals

1084
01:40:59.580 --> 01:41:01.090
Anthony Taylor: elbow data

1085
01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:03.960
Anthony Taylor: inertia.

1086
01:41:06.090 --> 01:41:10.930
Anthony Taylor: And now let's just do a quick loop. And we're going to say, for I

1087
01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:12.760
Anthony Taylor: in range

1088
01:41:12.810 --> 01:41:14.890
Anthony Taylor: one comma

1089
01:41:15.130 --> 01:41:19.510
Anthony Taylor: links of K, so this is just going to loop

1090
01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:22.180
Anthony Taylor: for every value in K,

1091
01:41:22.710 --> 01:41:27.790
Anthony Taylor: okay? And we're gonna say. percentage

1092
01:41:30.150 --> 01:41:31.490
Anthony Taylor: decrease

1093
01:41:32.570 --> 01:41:41.209
Anthony Taylor: equals. So we're gonna look for how much it's going down each time in a percentage. So that formula, I'm gonna give us the formula because I

1094
01:41:41.710 --> 01:41:43.370
Anthony Taylor: I wouldn't know it off top magazine.

1095
01:41:44.430 --> 01:41:50.039
Anthony Taylor: I minus one. So we're taking the next value or the previous value.

1096
01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:53.439
Baro, Sonja: And in Terti, is that right?

1097
01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:55.100
Anthony Taylor: Did I spell it wrong?

1098
01:41:55.160 --> 01:42:01.230
Anthony Taylor: That's that's a new type of leadership.

1099
01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:05.859
Anthony Taylor: Thank you for catching that. So we didn't have to do that later.

1100
01:42:06.430 --> 01:42:08.620
Anthony Taylor: And we're and we're going to divide this

1101
01:42:08.700 --> 01:42:11.839
Anthony Taylor: by the same record

1102
01:42:12.140 --> 01:42:13.170
Anthony Taylor: times, 100.

1103
01:42:13.210 --> 01:42:16.150
Anthony Taylor: Multiply it by time by 100.

1104
01:42:16.670 --> 01:42:18.719
Anthony Taylor: So I minus one.

1105
01:42:22.570 --> 01:42:23.430
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1106
01:42:25.790 --> 01:42:31.800
Anthony Taylor: so that gives us our percentage decrease, and then we'll print out each one.

1107
01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:34.699
Anthony Taylor: So we'll say at percentage

1108
01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:44.189
Anthony Taylor: decrease. Let's make this real informative from K equals

1109
01:42:46.580 --> 01:42:47.660
Anthony Taylor: K

1110
01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:50.250
Anthony Taylor: bracket.

1111
01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:53.090
Anthony Taylor: I minus one.

1112
01:42:53.550 --> 01:42:58.469
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Do you need a parentheses around the numerator of that fraction?

1113
01:42:59.820 --> 01:43:01.979
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Because it's a minus Nope.

1114
01:43:02.290 --> 01:43:03.409
Anthony Taylor: it'll be okay.

1115
01:43:03.470 --> 01:43:05.929
Meredith McCanse (she/her): But we could if you wanted to.

1116
01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:10.400
Anthony Taylor: But let's run it like that and see what it comes out. But that's a good good observation.

1117
01:43:10.610 --> 01:43:12.899
Anthony Taylor: I like it. When you guys do that to me, I'm like.

1118
01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:15.829
Anthony Taylor: maybe Nope, don't think so.

1119
01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:18.800
Anthony Taylor: But that's okay. Okay.

1120
01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:23.580
Anthony Taylor: Aye. and

1121
01:43:23.910 --> 01:43:30.530
Anthony Taylor:  Then we'll pass in. We'll give the actual value that percentage decrease came up with

1122
01:43:32.270 --> 01:43:40.570
Anthony Taylor:  how?

1123
01:43:42.380 --> 01:43:48.390
Anthony Taylor: Let's make this a little smarter. We haven't done this in a long time, so we'll do this to 2 decimal points.

1124
01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:49.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

1125
01:43:50.250 --> 01:43:53.310
Anthony Taylor: And then we'll put in a percent sign here

1126
01:43:54.610 --> 01:43:56.969
Anthony Taylor: and there we go. Wow!

1127
01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:00.230
Anthony Taylor: Those numbers are crazy. High.

1128
01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:06.200
Anthony Taylor: What do you guys think? I'm thinking the persons are.

1129
01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:09.970
Anthony Taylor: Meredith? I see. How about you one year?

1130
01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:16.069
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yep, and around this. and you'll need a 11 or

1131
01:44:16.350 --> 01:44:18.650
Anthony Taylor: good job. I love that. You got that.

1132
01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:25.609
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So now we can see K, one, k, 2 was 2515, 19, 7,

1133
01:44:26.670 --> 01:44:28.829
Anthony Taylor: 1613, 1910.

1134
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:35.610
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So we can see here that between 3 and 4,

1135
01:44:36.430 --> 01:44:42.600
Anthony Taylor: right is is a decent, you know, it starts to level out which yeah, maybe.

1136
01:44:42.810 --> 01:44:49.869
Anthony Taylor:  really. Yeah, I still would. I would still say.

1137
01:44:50.730 --> 01:44:55.189
Anthony Taylor: probably 3 and 4, I'm still leaning towards 4. So I say, we go with 4,

1138
01:44:55.670 --> 01:44:59.600
Anthony Taylor: right? Because they leveling out. And then it's just like flat flap.

1139
01:45:00.130 --> 01:45:02.410
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so let's do 4.

1140
01:45:02.730 --> 01:45:05.999
Anthony Taylor: So what do we got to do? So we do. Our model equals.

1141
01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:07.990
Anthony Taylor: K means

1142
01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:11.249
Anthony Taylor: and clusters equals 4.

1143
01:45:11.730 --> 01:45:13.930
We can do init

1144
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.549
Anthony Taylor: equals auto.

1145
01:45:16.450 --> 01:45:23.069
Anthony Taylor: and we'll go ahead and put in a random state. Let's keep it the same random state as I had up above.

1146
01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:25.450
Anthony Taylor: We'll do fit.

1147
01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:37.540
Anthony Taylor: We'll make our predictions and assign them to variable a underscore 4 equals model.

1148
01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:39.810
Anthony Taylor: The predict

1149
01:45:40.930 --> 01:45:42.380
Anthony Taylor: pass in our data

1150
01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:47.639
Anthony Taylor: that'll work.

1151
01:45:48.220 --> 01:45:56.970
Anthony Taylor: create a copy of our data. So we're gonna call this predictions customer underscore predictions

1152
01:45:58.600 --> 01:45:59.680
Anthony Taylor: picos.

1153
01:46:00.750 --> 01:46:01.590
Anthony Taylor: copy.

1154
01:46:03.870 --> 01:46:14.699
Anthony Taylor: And we're going to add our labels to it. So we know that's gonna come from this variable right here. So we're going to say customers

1155
01:46:15.530 --> 01:46:22.649
Anthony Taylor: predictions that the app, let's add a new column called Customer segment. because that's basically what we're doing here

1156
01:46:23.450 --> 01:46:26.479
Anthony Taylor: equals K, und score 4

1157
01:46:28.430 --> 01:46:43.090
Clayton Graves:  Were you adding the column to the original data frame or to the new 100, that's a good question. We should be adding it to this one.

1158
01:46:44.150 --> 01:46:49.920
Anthony Taylor: which is okay, because I got an error anyway. See if we can find it.

1159
01:46:51.290 --> 01:46:55.720
Anthony Taylor: Model dot fits. Didn't like something in my fit statement.

1160
01:46:56.090 --> 01:46:58.670
Anthony Taylor: which probably means my cluster has a pub.

1161
01:47:00.010 --> 01:47:04.410
Anthony Taylor: So oh, how about we put a data frame in there? Duh

1162
01:47:05.550 --> 01:47:07.940
Anthony Taylor: can't really fit without a data frame up

1163
01:47:08.980 --> 01:47:14.840
Anthony Taylor: much better. Alright. So now let's take a look at our predictions, database our data frame.

1164
01:47:16.380 --> 01:47:19.320
Anthony Taylor: And we can see we now have customer savements.

1165
01:47:19.620 --> 01:47:21.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So last thing we need to do

1166
01:47:21.870 --> 01:47:27.789
Anthony Taylor: create a plot. So we're gonna say, customers predictions.

1167
01:47:28.540 --> 01:47:30.030
Dot scatter.

1168
01:47:31.010 --> 01:47:36.089
Anthony Taylor: And in here we'll do X just pick frozen and grocery like they did in the other example.

1169
01:47:36.590 --> 01:47:38.230
Anthony Taylor: Frozen comma

1170
01:47:38.490 --> 01:47:40.849
Anthony Taylor: y will be grocery

1171
01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:46.059
Anthony Taylor: now doesn't matter which one we pick. Not. Really. You could pick any of them

1172
01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:53.889
Anthony Taylor:  any 2 values, because we're really just trying, I mean, in fact, some of the other ones might even be better as far as visual.

1173
01:47:54.220 --> 01:47:58.099
Anthony Taylor: But really we just want to see how the breakout is.

1174
01:47:58.170 --> 01:48:01.730
Anthony Taylor: and in fact, you'll let us pick something different. Let's pick

1175
01:48:02.050 --> 01:48:04.579
Anthony Taylor: you know what makes more sense, fresh

1176
01:48:05.090 --> 01:48:07.119
Anthony Taylor: and frozen. Don't you guys agree?

1177
01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:14.799
Anthony Taylor: I do. Okay? And then we got to do C will be our customer segment. a column.

1178
01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:17.340
Goodness.

1179
01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:24.299
Anthony Taylor: I don't know what's going on with my fingers. They are not working

1180
01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:28.300
Anthony Taylor: alright, and then color map.

1181
01:48:30.230 --> 01:48:32.590
Anthony Taylor: It goes viridis.

1182
01:48:33.930 --> 01:48:35.119
Anthony Taylor: That's interesting.

1183
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:38.809
Anthony Taylor: Alright, let's run that.

1184
01:48:41.950 --> 01:48:42.880
Anthony Taylor: Well.

1185
01:48:44.900 --> 01:48:50.370
Anthony Taylor: they're clusters. I don't know. They're very pretty clusters. Let's try

1186
01:48:56.260 --> 01:48:57.520
Anthony Taylor: some interesting.

1187
01:49:00.860 --> 01:49:01.800
Anthony Taylor: I don't know.

1188
01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:05.340
Anthony Taylor: I thought no confresh would give us something prettier. But

1189
01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:11.089
Anthony Taylor: anyway, so yeah, it came up with 4 separate clusters.

1190
01:49:11.730 --> 01:49:12.990
Anthony Taylor: That's cool.

1191
01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:23.759
Anthony Taylor:  Looking at this, you see, there is some overlap that is not uncommon.  some of these overlaps are interesting. But again.

1192
01:49:23.980 --> 01:49:26.949
Anthony Taylor: what's next? You go in.

1193
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:32.140
You look at the data. This is obviously scaled data. So it doesn't make a lot of sense. You'd have to unscale it.

1194
01:49:32.220 --> 01:49:34.780
Anthony Taylor: and you would look at it and come up with

1195
01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:39.749
Anthony Taylor: why, it went to each of those clusters.

1196
01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:43.840
Anthony Taylor: What made that do that?

1197
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:47.780
Anthony Taylor: That is the hard work. So.

1198
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:50.100
Baro, Sonja: Anthony, beforehand?

1199
01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:51.479
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, no. Go ahead

1200
01:49:51.540 --> 01:49:56.170
Baro, Sonja: before you leave that. Can you go back down to where you're defining the scatter plot?

1201
01:49:56.990 --> 01:50:03.079
Baro, Sonja: On the X and y. So I'm trying to to process

1202
01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:10.780
Baro, Sonja: how to how to define those. Because earlier, you had said, X is the data to train.

1203
01:50:11.070 --> 01:50:16.199
Baro, Sonja: And why is the target that's for the training. That's not for the scatterplot.

1204
01:50:16.260 --> 01:50:22.890
Baro, Sonja: I'm not for the prediction. That's why. Well, this is the scatter plot. This is just showing you the data when we do.

1205
01:50:22.990 --> 01:50:30.750
Anthony Taylor: Our training and and and unsupervised doesn't have that unsupervised. Everything is the training gate

1206
01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:36.459
Anthony Taylor: right? When we get to supervise and we have a label. Y will be the label.

1207
01:50:37.950 --> 01:50:44.149
Anthony Taylor: and X will be everything else. So why is the target? That's what we're trying to predict.

1208
01:50:44.350 --> 01:50:50.999
Anthony Taylor: I mean, you could argue that the cluster value is what we're trying to predict here, but we don't know it ahead of time, so

1209
01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:52.850
Anthony Taylor: there's no target.

1210
01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:57.839
Anthony Taylor: There's no target because there's nothing there yet. When we do supervise, we have a target.

1211
01:50:58.300 --> 01:50:59.200
Baro, Sonja: Okay.

1212
01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:07.029
Anthony Taylor: I'm glad you asked that, because I'm glad you clarified that this is, it was just the early example. They included the Y value.

1213
01:51:07.110 --> 01:51:13.429
Anthony Taylor: like, I told you, when we do unsupervised, we would have dropped that anyway. as we don't want to know what was there.

1214
01:51:13.970 --> 01:51:15.589
Baro, Sonja: Okay, yeah. Yeah. Bye.

1215
01:51:16.570 --> 01:51:20.039
michael mcpherson: can I see the define? The model with 4 clusters bit

1216
01:51:21.580 --> 01:51:23.080
michael mcpherson: mine came up with this

1217
01:51:23.820 --> 01:51:25.549
michael mcpherson: float error

1218
01:51:28.220 --> 01:51:29.390
Anthony Taylor: in here.

1219
01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:30.670
michael mcpherson: Yeah.

1220
01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:33.650
Anthony Taylor: alright, that I gotta see.

1221
01:51:33.860 --> 01:51:34.600
michael mcpherson: Yeah.

1222
01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:36.770
Anthony Taylor: Share, please.

1223
01:51:37.870 --> 01:51:38.750
michael mcpherson: Okay.

1224
01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:48.000
michael mcpherson: probably a typing error.

1225
01:51:52.030 --> 01:51:53.970
Anthony Taylor: I don't think the float errors there.

1226
01:51:54.870 --> 01:51:56.669
Anthony Taylor: Voter is in your fit.

1227
01:51:56.980 --> 01:52:00.200
Dipinto, Matt: You've got a string around your data frame.

1228
01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:06.970
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, get rid of the the quotes around the data frame on both of those. could I.

1229
01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:16.560
michael mcpherson: That's so.

1230
01:52:17.230 --> 01:52:18.050
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

1231
01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:19.770
michael mcpherson: Hello, Laila.

1232
01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:22.870
michael mcpherson: thanks, Buddy.

1233
01:52:23.810 --> 01:52:26.360
Anthony Taylor: That was good. Good eye, sir.

1234
01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:40.839
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so any other question. So let's let's talk about how to create the elbow one more time. So the key with the elbow

1235
01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:45.390
Anthony Taylor: is you're gonna create an empty list.

1236
01:52:45.890 --> 01:52:49.420
Anthony Taylor: a list of how many different clusters you want to try.

1237
01:52:49.890 --> 01:52:55.559
Anthony Taylor: You're going to create this for loop passing in the number. And that's the only thing you're going to change.

1238
01:52:56.930 --> 01:53:00.620
Anthony Taylor: Okay.  and

1239
01:53:01.610 --> 01:53:09.360
Anthony Taylor: and just put the fill. The fill. This list is basically what you're doing. Once that's done, create a data frame from the data

1240
01:53:09.900 --> 01:53:20.020
Anthony Taylor: and plot your life honestly. that would have been enough for me. If you I don't know if they're gonna ask you to see if they're gonna ask you to do all this other stuff.

1241
01:53:20.820 --> 01:53:23.309
Anthony Taylor: I would doubt can't imagine why they would.

1242
01:53:25.260 --> 01:53:28.599
Anthony Taylor: Okay, create a for loop dictionary data frame

1243
01:53:31.070 --> 01:53:32.819
Anthony Taylor: perform the following.

1244
01:53:41.770 --> 01:53:42.480
are.

1245
01:53:43.060 --> 01:53:48.880
Anthony Taylor: they're gonna have you try like a couple of them. It looks like, yeah, it doesn't look like they're gonna make you do all that other stuff. So

1246
01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:50.550
should be straightforward.

1247
01:53:50.890 --> 01:53:53.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay. alright.

1248
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:56.040
Anthony Taylor: So for this one.

1249
01:53:57.510 --> 01:54:06.739
Anthony Taylor: you're going to get 20 min, I'm pretty sure. What time is it? 100'clock. I would say. 20 min sounds perfectly right. Let me see.

1250
01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:10.610
Anthony Taylor: Passed it.

1251
01:54:12.310 --> 01:54:16.439
Anthony Taylor: Oh, that was review. Mic. Wow! Okay, 20.

1252
01:54:17.190 --> 01:54:18.200
Anthony Taylor: Alright

1253
01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:22.549
Anthony Taylor: perfect. Bye, kang!

1254
01:54:22.700 --> 01:54:24.109
Anthony Taylor: Call us if you need us.

1255
01:54:27.770 --> 01:54:29.230
Clayton Graves: I think it's 3,

1256
01:54:30.430 --> 01:54:36.189
Anthony Taylor: 3, 3 is 3, the answer let's find, let's find out.

1257
01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:40.920
Anthony Taylor:  alright, are we ready? So yeah.

1258
01:54:41.170 --> 01:54:44.500
Baro, Sonja: one thing I'd like to request is.

1259
01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:55.259
Baro, Sonja: I'm not getting what I'm putting in X and y still, and I'm sorry I might be dense tonight. So why is not important? You're not putting anything in. What

1260
01:54:56.600 --> 01:54:57.719
Anthony Taylor: does that help?

1261
01:54:57.820 --> 01:55:07.710
Anthony Taylor: Even when we did the plotting like no scatter plot is something different. So realize the scatter plot is nothing to do with what we're doing in this today.

1262
01:55:08.050 --> 01:55:15.660
Anthony Taylor: The scatterplot is just a way to visualize the output. So the X and y is the x and y of the scatterplot.

1263
01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:19.329
Anthony Taylor: not the x and y of the machine learning model

1264
01:55:20.210 --> 01:55:21.310
Anthony Taylor: make sense.

1265
01:55:23.860 --> 01:55:27.179
Baro, Sonja: and every scatter plot has to have an X and Y,

1266
01:55:27.430 --> 01:55:30.809
Anthony Taylor: so we have to put something in. Otherwise, you know.

1267
01:55:30.930 --> 01:55:37.390
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. And we'll you know what? When we get to it we'll try again. But III there, there is no why.

1268
01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:45.070
Anthony Taylor: they're the X and Y, and come up earlier was in regards to machine learning models, not visuals.

1269
01:55:45.320 --> 01:55:49.209
Anthony Taylor: So we'll get there. We'll we'll get there. You're gonna be okay, I promise

1270
01:55:49.350 --> 01:55:51.040
Anthony Taylor: alright. So we got our data

1271
01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:56.189
Anthony Taylor: this one's interesting. Okay? At least it makes some sense.

1272
01:55:56.730 --> 01:56:02.729
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So you did your inertia, and you did your one to 10 through your loop.

1273
01:56:02.830 --> 01:56:06.979
Anthony Taylor: Nothing new here, just like we did in the instructor one

1274
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:10.800
Anthony Taylor: and then we're gonna put it in a data frame.

1275
01:56:11.650 --> 01:56:18.159
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then we're going to plant it loop. So this one's pretty clear.

1276
01:56:18.660 --> 01:56:22.259
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this one's probably a 3, almost, for sure.

1277
01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:26.120
Anthony Taylor: Hey? You could argue maybe 4. But I would go with 3,

1278
01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:30.319
Anthony Taylor: because the this angle and this angle

1279
01:56:30.610 --> 01:56:32.920
Anthony Taylor: they're they're it's pretty much shallow.

1280
01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:34.520
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

1281
01:56:34.780 --> 01:56:39.950
Anthony Taylor: so it says, following task for each of the 2, most likely.

1282
01:56:40.410 --> 01:56:42.380
Anthony Taylor: There's number 3.

1283
01:56:43.580 --> 01:56:52.189
Anthony Taylor: Do you get better spotting that in the curve with time, cause I'm more than one

1284
01:56:52.250 --> 01:56:58.059
Anthony Taylor: like we'll always check it with. I mean again back to my scenario. Marketing comes to you.

1285
01:56:58.180 --> 01:57:02.330
Anthony Taylor: Hey? Can you segment this data for us? We think we have 2 segments. Okay.

1286
01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:06.319
Anthony Taylor: alright. But I run this and the two's way up here.

1287
01:57:06.630 --> 01:57:09.070
Anthony Taylor: I'm like, no, they have more than 2.

1288
01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:14.450
Anthony Taylor: I'm still gonna give them 2. And then I'm gonna give them 3. Also

1289
01:57:15.590 --> 01:57:25.569
Anthony Taylor: right. It's just that it's just standard. If if you if you weren't given anything, then you would probably in this case run a 3 and a 4, and then

1290
01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:34.720
Anthony Taylor: analyze. Do the data analysis on the result, and come up with which one makes the most sense? It's it. This particular thing

1291
01:57:36.100 --> 01:57:37.400
Anthony Taylor: there's

1292
01:57:37.790 --> 01:57:45.369
Anthony Taylor: 3 is not the wrong answer, and 3 is not the right answer. It's whatever an answer fits your your analysis of the date.

1293
01:57:46.230 --> 01:57:52.189
Anthony Taylor: So again I throw this out to my business users. And they look at it. And they're like.

1294
01:57:52.290 --> 01:57:59.589
Anthony Taylor: Okay, yeah, we have 4 different segments. Or. well, I see you gave us 4. But these 2 are similar enough. Let's just combine.

1295
01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:06.920
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And then you just drop that down to 3. But that that's how I use this

1296
01:58:06.970 --> 01:58:10.540
Anthony Taylor: right. And I, honestly, I don't use the curve. II use the numbers.

1297
01:58:10.620 --> 01:58:13.690
Anthony Taylor: I just look at them and decide which one looks right.

1298
01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:19.440
Anthony Taylor: So anyway. So here we did 3. We could see the the values.

1299
01:58:19.700 --> 01:58:27.169
Anthony Taylor: Here's our scatter plot. So the X and the Y here completely could be any of these 2 columns.

1300
01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:31.079
Anthony Taylor: Well, this one wouldn't make a lot of sense any. Yeah, no, it'd be all right.

1301
01:58:31.110 --> 01:58:32.700
Anthony Taylor: Any of those calls

1302
01:58:32.870 --> 01:58:36.760
Anthony Taylor: in this case. So any 2 just pick 2 now.

1303
01:58:36.870 --> 01:58:43.669
Anthony Taylor: I mean, like, if we did value and low might be a little weird.

1304
01:58:43.930 --> 01:58:46.279
Anthony Taylor: But you could. We could do

1305
01:58:49.640 --> 01:58:53.799
Anthony Taylor: still works right. All we're trying to do is show

1306
01:58:54.020 --> 01:58:58.709
Anthony Taylor: a scatter. So we need an X in the Y, the X and the Y could be any of these 2 columns

1307
01:58:59.190 --> 01:59:00.610
Anthony Taylor: for the plot

1308
01:59:01.490 --> 01:59:05.750
Anthony Taylor: when we ran the model, it ran all of these colors.

1309
01:59:06.790 --> 01:59:15.579
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So if we were so, just as a quick example for next week. if we were trying to predict this column right here.

1310
01:59:16.140 --> 01:59:17.970
Anthony Taylor: this would be our Y,

1311
01:59:20.900 --> 01:59:22.739
Anthony Taylor: and this would be our X.

1312
01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:25.190
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1313
01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:29.300
Anthony Taylor: that's how machine learning works. It's like all of these are the X,

1314
01:59:29.970 --> 01:59:32.400
Anthony Taylor: and we're trying to predict this. Why.

1315
01:59:33.130 --> 01:59:35.370
Anthony Taylor: okay, this is

1316
01:59:35.640 --> 01:59:42.990
Anthony Taylor: positional. This has nothing to do with machine learning. This is just a plot. Alright, so you could use any 2 of the values you want.

1317
01:59:43.660 --> 01:59:46.020
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, so you got.

1318
01:59:47.230 --> 01:59:50.729
Anthony Taylor: There's the 3 clusters that don't look bad. Let's try it with 4.

1319
01:59:51.310 --> 01:59:52.469
Anthony Taylor: Plot it out.

1320
01:59:54.450 --> 01:59:56.160
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. I like 3 better

1321
01:59:57.390 --> 02:00:01.670
Anthony Taylor: again. I mean just looking at it visually. It doesn't answer the question.

1322
02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:07.059
Anthony Taylor: You have to look at the data. Okay. have to look at the date.

1323
02:00:07.970 --> 02:00:10.150
Anthony Taylor:  yeah.

1324
02:00:10.780 --> 02:00:13.380
Anthony Taylor: they said 3. Also. Hmm.

1325
02:00:15.090 --> 02:00:16.550
Anthony Taylor: Clayton was right.

1326
02:00:18.350 --> 02:00:20.880
Anthony Taylor: So any questions.

1327
02:00:23.290 --> 02:00:25.360
Anthony Taylor: any questions at all.

1328
02:00:28.530 --> 02:00:29.430
Anthony Taylor: No.

1329
02:00:29.970 --> 02:00:41.370
Anthony Taylor:  So next class, you're gonna do this elbow curve again. We're gonna scale next class that came up couple of times last couple of days.

1330
02:00:41.420 --> 02:00:43.580
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna start preprocessing

1331
02:00:44.490 --> 02:00:48.939
Anthony Taylor: alright. So we're gonna learn, we're gonna start learning how to prepare our data

1332
02:00:49.520 --> 02:01:00.160
Anthony Taylor: for machine learning. Right today. The data was mostly given to you prepared. So you didn't have to worry about it. But there you go

1333
02:01:00.420 --> 02:01:03.369
Anthony Taylor: tomorrow you're gonna learn how to do. Fairly simple.

1334
02:01:03.850 --> 02:01:05.699
Anthony Taylor: that's all I got for you guys.

1335
02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:09.629
Anthony Taylor: If you you are free to go until

1336
02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:11.500
Anthony Taylor: Wednesday.

1337
02:01:13.260 --> 02:01:14.789
Anthony Taylor: holy Moly.

1338
02:01:15.980 --> 02:01:17.980
Anthony Taylor: it's like you get a whole nother holiday.

1339
02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:22.910
Anthony Taylor: Hi! Gang have fun. We'll be here for 30 min.

1340
02:01:26.350 --> 02:01:27.850
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I have a question.

1341
02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:29.210
Anthony Taylor: Yes.

1342
02:01:30.030 --> 02:01:31.999
Meredith McCanse (she/her): so I'm thinking more about like

1343
02:01:32.220 --> 02:01:43.469
Meredith McCanse (she/her): used cases or so. The question you asked earlier, of what would you use grouping for? Or I don't know. That's not how you yeah,

1344
02:01:43.740 --> 02:01:45.280
Meredith McCanse (she/her): what about something like

1345
02:01:45.340 --> 02:01:56.619
Meredith McCanse (she/her): predicting? Which like, if you're thinking about like vendor invoices that you need to pay? Would could there be a way to predict like which invoices are we likely to pay late.

1346
02:01:56.750 --> 02:01:57.940
Meredith McCanse (she/her): or

1347
02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:10.450
Meredith McCanse (she/her):  Would that be a clustering or a classification, because you would have, because your invoices, you would know if they were late. Yeah, that would fall under under supervise.

1348
02:02:10.670 --> 02:02:14.800
Meredith McCanse (she/her): But that would be for past data. But what about for like future?

1349
02:02:15.220 --> 02:02:25.750
Anthony Taylor: Well, no, that's what you do. So what you would do say so say you have 100,000 invoices. and there might. And you could tell they're late by simply looking at the due date and the date. They were paid

1350
02:02:25.860 --> 02:02:34.480
Anthony Taylor: so you could create a column that is late, not late. Right? So what we would do with that is, we would take that. We would put that into a classification algorithm.

1351
02:02:34.540 --> 02:02:39.479
Anthony Taylor: And then based on the the other fields.

1352
02:02:40.310 --> 02:02:46.999
Anthony Taylor: you could say, this one's probably gonna be late, or it'll predict the probability that, based on

1353
02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:52.710
Anthony Taylor: the data of all of your late ones. And that's if there's a pattern realize again, it's just like

1354
02:02:52.810 --> 02:02:56.790
Anthony Taylor: with the data analytics stuff. There's not always a viable power.

1355
02:02:57.290 --> 02:02:59.349
Anthony Taylor: Right? So I would say, late.

1356
02:03:00.030 --> 02:03:04.960
Anthony Taylor: like late invoice payments might not, might not fall in a pack.

1357
02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:06.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1358
02:03:06.650 --> 02:03:10.050
Anthony Taylor: for an organization, for an individual. Maybe

1359
02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:17.610
Anthony Taylor: like you could say, Oh, well, with the you know, you could say. And and I'll bet you this true well, credit companies think it's true

1360
02:03:17.630 --> 02:03:22.830
Anthony Taylor: right. If a person has 60% credit utilization.

1361
02:03:24.110 --> 02:03:26.099
Anthony Taylor: What are the odds? They're gonna be late.

1362
02:03:28.250 --> 02:03:36.079
Anthony Taylor: probably pretty hot. right? Because they got a ton of rigging bills going out. or at least one really big one.

1363
02:03:36.590 --> 02:03:47.030
Anthony Taylor:  so so you know you, you could do that. But from an unsupervised standpoint, what you're really looking for is in patterns of something that you don't know the answer to yet.

1364
02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:49.400
Anthony Taylor: You don't know if it's late or not late.

1365
02:03:49.560 --> 02:03:53.510
Anthony Taylor: right or well, that'll always be a classification.

1366
02:03:53.590 --> 02:04:01.430
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, yeah, I'm sure we could. You know what? Let's ask our friend and see what. Let's see if it could come up with a

1367
02:04:01.740 --> 02:04:05.840
Anthony Taylor: a nice use case finance use case for questions.

1368
02:04:07.290 --> 02:04:11.590
Anthony Taylor: Provide me a number of use cases

1369
02:04:12.790 --> 02:04:14.690
Anthony Taylor: in finance

1370
02:04:15.570 --> 02:04:19.530
Anthony Taylor: for lust. Ml. Lester.

1371
02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:21.900
Anthony Taylor: It'll have

1372
02:04:22.250 --> 02:04:23.550
gazillions.

1373
02:04:23.890 --> 02:04:30.490
Anthony Taylor: customer segmentation, okay? Based on their spending patterns, income levels, fraud, detection.

1374
02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:33.750
Anthony Taylor: credit scoring risk management.

1375
02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:38.539
Meredith McCanse (she/her): That's not really finance like that. Seems like.

1376
02:04:39.090 --> 02:04:41.949
Anthony Taylor: well, how about anomalies in financial auditing?

1377
02:04:42.350 --> 02:04:44.589
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yeah. go, do it

1378
02:04:44.790 --> 02:04:48.900
Meredith McCanse (she/her): or like transaction data.

1379
02:04:49.630 --> 02:04:50.620
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

1380
02:04:50.760 --> 02:05:03.249
Anthony Taylor: there you go. Operational optimization, clustering various operational metrics, financial institutions can identify inefficiencies and optimize processes for better performance and cost savings.

1381
02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:10.090
Meredith McCanse (she/her): What would the data be that you feed in for that, though we'd have to figure out here? How about this?

1382
02:05:10.970 --> 02:05:13.229
Anthony Taylor: give me an example.

1383
02:05:14.020 --> 02:05:15.139
The type

1384
02:05:15.720 --> 02:05:17.460
Anthony Taylor: data use

1385
02:05:18.910 --> 02:05:21.139
Anthony Taylor: and operational

1386
02:05:22.180 --> 02:05:23.810
Anthony Taylor: optimization

1387
02:05:25.290 --> 02:05:26.940
Anthony Taylor: statement

1388
02:05:29.460 --> 02:05:31.169
Anthony Taylor: in this context.

1389
02:05:32.910 --> 02:05:39.390
Anthony Taylor: transaction data values of transactions, types of transactions, processing time error rates.

1390
02:05:40.330 --> 02:05:52.959
Meredith McCanse (she/her): customer interaction data, frequency and type customer duration of customer service calls customer feedback.

1391
02:05:53.620 --> 02:06:00.810
Meredith McCanse (she/her): What about like operational? The sense of like the accounting department has to reconcile the bank accounts every month, or the

1392
02:06:00.870 --> 02:06:16.429
Meredith McCanse (she/her): the Ap. Team has to process the invoices and then issue payment, or the you know, just they're sort of the behind the scenes. Operations that happen in running a business as opposed to like completely agree. That is, that is a possibility. I don't know what it I mean.

1393
02:06:16.620 --> 02:06:21.550
Anthony Taylor: see. And this is where we start getting into.  like

1394
02:06:21.730 --> 02:06:25.609
Anthony Taylor: very. This is where you guys, when you leave here.

1395
02:06:25.820 --> 02:06:33.350
Anthony Taylor: right, will benefit, because your understanding of that industry gives you insight into how to

1396
02:06:34.160 --> 02:06:37.660
Anthony Taylor: utilize what I'm showing you in your industry.

1397
02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:42.330
Anthony Taylor: Right? I I've worked in finance, but only on mortgage. And

1398
02:06:42.370 --> 02:06:44.149
Anthony Taylor: we didn't do a lot of email there.

1399
02:06:44.570 --> 02:06:49.340
Anthony Taylor: Though I don't have a lot of examples on on mortgage or finance at the top of my head.

1400
02:06:49.970 --> 02:06:51.230
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Retail

1401
02:06:51.290 --> 02:06:54.030
Anthony Taylor: and healthcare. I can give you those all day long.

1402
02:06:54.600 --> 02:06:56.080
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yeah, yeah.

1403
02:06:56.590 --> 02:07:05.379
Baro, Sonja: okay, thank you. So, Anthony, I want to kind of replay what we've learned tonight. Let me stop by recording.
