1
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:06.150
Anthony Taylor: Do.

2
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.140
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So

3
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.799
Anthony Taylor: you would think we would be almost done with machine learning. Well, that's good news, and I have bet

4
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.590
Anthony Taylor: that depends on how you take we have a lot more machine learning what.

5
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:32.970
Anthony Taylor: But we're gonna take ours and talk about some ways to optimize the machine learning we've learned thus far. It's a good place to do it.

6
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.310
Anthony Taylor: because

7
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:42.540
Anthony Taylor: these same scores and everything that we're going to talk about the coming days we're going to use later in much more advanced

8
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.810
Anthony Taylor: machine learning algorithms.

9
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:52.879
Anthony Taylor: Okay? As well as as we start digging in a little deeper, we're gonna get into natural language processing, which is really

10
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.839
Anthony Taylor: the beginning of like the chat bots and all that kind of stuff.

11
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.389
Anthony Taylor: Alright, so we're gonna get there. We're also gonna I'm gonna try.

12
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.429
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to say.

13
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:18.260
Anthony Taylor: Wednesday at 60'clock. I will be showing how to host a static website on Jur.

14
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.889
Anthony Taylor: Now I know I had you guys to credit card for open AI. Well.

15
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.520
Anthony Taylor: for sure, you will also need to give them something, however. But wait.

16
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.120
Anthony Taylor: you get a $200 credit when you first sign up. Okay.

17
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:41.089
Anthony Taylor: I have never spent a penny on a jewel ever. So I don't even think it's gonna I think you get one free website. So

18
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:48.359
Anthony Taylor: if I ever give you something that might cost money, I will show you how to delete it so that you don't have to worry about it costing

19
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.789
Anthony Taylor:  But yeah.

20
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.060
Anthony Taylor: So anyway.

21
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.190
Anthony Taylor: So Wednesday, 60'clock.

22
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.570
Anthony Taylor: I'm sorry.

23
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.440
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. 60'clock. Yeah.

24
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.770
Meredith McCanse (she/her): When you say static website, what does that mean? Like

25
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:14.270
Anthony Taylor: Javascript on it and put it up, and it'll host it on the Internet for you.

26
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.430
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So you'll have a real Internet URL, that you can.

27
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:26.109
Anthony Taylor: You can post. And and if you really want anybody wants to, if you you know, I showed you guys name cheap. Right?

28
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.839
Anthony Taylor: Did I show you guys name cheap. That's the domain place you can get websites for like 2 bucks.

29
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I can show you how to. But that domain

30
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.649
Anthony Taylor: on this free website that you're hosting on Internet

31
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.500
Anthony Taylor: so effectively costing you nothing.

32
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.900
Anthony Taylor: Alright, I have probably 7 websites like this on Aws.

33
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.039
Anthony Taylor: which I can show you that as well, if you really want but

34
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.559
Anthony Taylor: and and it cost me like 3 bucks a month.

35
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:05.110
Anthony Taylor: They have all these websites up. Just be clear. I don't get a lot of traffic. I mostly use them for vanity.

36
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.710
Anthony Taylor: but it's out.

37
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.789
Anthony Taylor: So that's what we're gonna do on Wednesday. I know that's not AI. But

38
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.759
Anthony Taylor: you guys don't get any other like web trainings, so you have no way to post anything unless you know how to do that. So I want you to know how to do

39
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.730
Anthony Taylor: and then the next review will probably be

40
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.940
Anthony Taylor: how to make your model work with an Api.

41
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.810
Anthony Taylor: Alright. That one takes a few minutes long.

42
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.200
Anthony Taylor: but it still should be between 6 and 6 30.

43
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.780
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Yeah, Sonya, did you? Wanna you wanna try the question.

44
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:49.509
Baro, Sonja: Yeah, I'm just wondering. Okay, yeah, would you cover, maybe in office hours, the architecture needed to support AI. So like

45
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:58.170
Baro, Sonja: data leaks, whatever cert like, I don't. Well, I don't know if you need data like, because you're doing the calls. But I understand what you say.

46
00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.670
Baro, Sonja: Okay,

47
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.059
Anthony Taylor: So let me let me. So here's the thing.

48
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.880
Anthony Taylor: Yes, in extra reviews.

49
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:14.629
Anthony Taylor: I've seen the last couple of weeks now, and we're definitely gonna get into some very specific

50
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.579
Anthony Taylor: Llllm related. Stuff. Okay?

51
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:25.260
Anthony Taylor:  in the extra reviews, though, III now know what I've covered to make sure you guys have it.

52
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:35.540
Anthony Taylor: The reality is to extend an Llm. See what I'm assuming. You're talking, cause. That's when you guys say, III got

53
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.280
Anthony Taylor: what do you guys say, hey, I

54
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.670
Anthony Taylor: right? But I'm assuming you're talking about chat.

55
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.839
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Realize, AI is

56
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.929
Anthony Taylor: all Ml is AI

57
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.170
Anthony Taylor: alright

58
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.579
Anthony Taylor: But but I'm assuming would say what you asked chapel and how to extend it.

59
00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.979
Anthony Taylor: which I don't feel

60
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.119
Anthony Taylor: you're gonna get a ton of unless I do it in extra reviews. So why do I say that

61
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:14.169
Anthony Taylor: to support an LOM. We're not going to get into that architecture that's massive. It's bigger unless you're going to go work for Ibm Google

62
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.189
Anthony Taylor: or open AI or Microsoft.

63
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:24.369
Anthony Taylor: you know, to make them. You're never gonna need to know. Okay, I don't even know that I could give you the full

64
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.649
Anthony Taylor: space of it, cause it's it's a massive amount of

65
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.950
Anthony Taylor:  But what I'm going to do

66
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.809
Anthony Taylor: is show you how to embed documents.

67
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:43.270
Anthony Taylor: pictures, files, databases, all of these things can be used to extend an llip.

68
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:53.980
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And you will be able to add them. Either on the fly well, at the very least, on the fly, embedding them permanently, is a little more complicated.

69
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.700
Anthony Taylor: We will get to that to some

70
00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.069
Anthony Taylor: degree. I don't know how much we'll do with that.

71
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:08.160
Anthony Taylor: but making it so like you can create a chat. Bot! That loads. So say, you're Tanya's research.

72
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:17.099
Anthony Taylor: Okay? For all her cool stuff she's done. She wants to put that in a chat box. Well, it's like, what do you have it in a website or a Pdf, or anything? Yeah, I do. Okay.

73
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:31.330
Anthony Taylor: here's how to build this. But in just all that, when the chat bot starts up. and now it will utilize your information when answering questions as well as everything else. It has access.

74
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:38.199
Anthony Taylor: so it'll it'll enhance the existing chat Bot with additional information that you guys feed it.

75
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.369
Anthony Taylor: That's I'm going to try to do that

76
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:52.650
Anthony Taylor: in the coming weeks. I've already started building the the demo. It's not hard. It's really not hard, but there's a couple of steps I want to get to before I show it to you.

77
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.700
Anthony Taylor: because that's to me.

78
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.890
Anthony Taylor: That is what if if you talk to a company about I would work in AI.

79
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.659
Anthony Taylor: That's what they're gonna want to know if you know how to do.

80
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.029
Anthony Taylor: Okay, can you? And extend this to use my information? Yes.

81
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.609
Anthony Taylor: okay. Now, the permanent extension. So basically.

82
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.609
Anthony Taylor: And and and and here's the thing. A lot of companies aren't wanting this right now.

83
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:32.970
Anthony Taylor: Because it's expensive. So if you go to open AI and say, Hey, I wanna add all of Tonya's research that she's done in her company to this this model and deploy it through my whole whatever.

84
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.759
Anthony Taylor: Okay, everybody in the world.

85
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.050
Anthony Taylor: Okay, they will charge you like double

86
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.520
Anthony Taylor: how much it costs to run. Just open AI by itself.

87
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.040
Anthony Taylor: It's very expensive.

88
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:54.169
Anthony Taylor: So I'm not seeing a lot of people jump on that bandwagon now. and I'm going to finish this up right here.

89
00:07:54.770 --> 00:08:03.860
Anthony Taylor: A lot of the open source models like Llama Seventyb and and llama 2. And there's a couple of other ones that are open source right now.

90
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:08.970
Anthony Taylor: People are extending those, and it's not costing them any extra at all, so

91
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:19.539
Anthony Taylor: we'll see if we can get into like permanently extending. But if you do that, you have to betraying it to all this, if you do what I said, where you loaded when you started up.

92
00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:25.399
Anthony Taylor: takes a little longer to start up, but it's gonna have the freshest data available to you

93
00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:27.659
Anthony Taylor: the minute it loads up

94
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:33.549
Anthony Taylor: right? So if you change like 5 of the Pdfs. Or 5 of the documents

95
00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:41.450
Anthony Taylor: the next time it loads up it's just going to pick up those new documents. There's no retraining. There's no redeployment now.

96
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.660
Anthony Taylor: So anyway, that's the plan

97
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.720
Anthony Taylor: as of right now.

98
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:54.359
Anthony Taylor: It could change. But that's kind of where I hope to take you guys as we've

99
00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:07.190
Anthony Taylor: work through the end of the course, we're getting close. We're 2 weeks from Project 2, which is going to be heavy. Ml, so it's going to be everything you did in Project one. But now you're going to add an email to.

100
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.850
Anthony Taylor: So some kind of predictive analytics, some kind of upstream, something like that.

101
00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.650
Anthony Taylor: It doesn't have to be the same topic by the way.

102
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:21.090
Anthony Taylor:  And then, after that, we go into, like the the Nlp. And

103
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:31.089
Anthony Taylor: deep learning, and a lot of other things that are much more specific to vision and and and audio and

104
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.960
Anthony Taylor: verbal, and all that kind of stuff. Okay.

105
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:39.369
Anthony Taylor: that's it. That was an unexpected lecture.

106
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:47.039
Anthony Taylor: but I hope it makes people smile. Hurry, smile. I feel better. Yeah, Ronnie.

107
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:57.170
Masarirambi, Rodney: I know you just briefly mentioned that you saw everything that's coming. Can you? Is there any more stuff that you can let us know about that

108
00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:06.760
Masarirambi, Rodney: you mean about the class, the the curriculum. So right now, I mean, we're after.

109
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.450
Anthony Taylor: Go and get the list.

110
00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:18.730
Anthony Taylor: So after Project 2, we have 2 weeks of deep learning, which is very, very important. We have nlp, after that.

111
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.139
Anthony Taylor: Hold on. Go into the Dev tree.

112
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.639
then transformers.

113
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:41.569
Anthony Taylor: which is vital for getting data into and then emerging AI topics, which is kind of an open area for us to do

114
00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.210
Anthony Taylor: anything else we want to stick in.

115
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:48.490
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it'll it'll be specific by the time they finish writing it.

116
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.360
Anthony Taylor: But

117
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:56.689
Anthony Taylor: the the group that I'm involved with the Advisory Council we're like, Hey.

118
00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.960
Anthony Taylor: you gotta get this in there. You gotta get this in there. You gotta get this in

119
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:05.760
Anthony Taylor: right. And that's what they're working on for those those last 2 weeks. And then there's the final project.

120
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:18.020
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So I'm hoping to see some cool email, some data analysis, and maybe even some chat bot type functionality. One thing that's missing that I want to get you.

121
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:29.929
Anthony Taylor: And I'm and this is probably the only thing I'm a little worried about getting out to you guys is how to create an actual interface for these chat bots.

122
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:34.419
Anthony Taylor: That's not really part of the scope of this. But

123
00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:39.929
Anthony Taylor: for you guys to really do something effectively in your github. It would sure be nice if you could do that

124
00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.510
Anthony Taylor: right if you could say, Hey, here's an actual check.

125
00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:48.650
Anthony Taylor: right? So anyway, we'll see. I. I'm pretty sure. But

126
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.430
Anthony Taylor: it just depends. It depends on how busy I get it. Stuff. Cause

127
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.320
Anthony Taylor: I gotta do most of that stuff.

128
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.580
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so let's get back to it.

129
00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:11.850
Anthony Taylor: Alright model validation. So today, we're gonna do a couple of things. We have a couple of interesting exercise that are more conversations

130
00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:16.900
Anthony Taylor: than they are guys. Cody. Okay,

131
00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:27.670
Anthony Taylor: the coding exercises continue to be easier than they were in the past. Do keep in mind, you guys, way smarter than you were when you started all of this stuff.

132
00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:33.789
Anthony Taylor: So while these exercise make you ridiculously simple, and some of them are

133
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:38.950
Anthony Taylor: it's just because you're better at okay, also.

134
00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:43.940
Anthony Taylor: And one more thing, I noticed a comment on the challenges. Okay.

135
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.290
Anthony Taylor: how do I take?

136
00:12:46.660 --> 00:13:01.869
Anthony Taylor: IIII like, when we started, everyone hated challenges because they were too hard. And now they seem to be like, I don't want to. Sometimes they're hard, sometimes they're not most of the Ml. Ones, and by opinion are not very difficult.

137
00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:02.830
Anthony Taylor: But

138
00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.750
Anthony Taylor: what is it? Model, fit? Predict, score it done.

139
00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.439
Anthony Taylor: There's no way to make that any harder.

140
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:16.479
Anthony Taylor: Okay, until today. today, we're gonna try to make it help

141
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:23.009
Anthony Taylor: alright. So what are we gonna do today? We're gonna select target. What does that mean? Well, our target variable

142
00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:30.079
Anthony Taylor: just because you have a bunch of data at work, or or that you're looking at doesn't mean you don't even know what the target is.

143
00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:41.759
Anthony Taylor: We need to figure that out. We're gonna choose metric, a metric for measure cream. What is gonna how do we know if this model is any good and is accuracy enough. Guess what

144
00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:47.759
Anthony Taylor: this is. Gonna be a a spoiler. Accuracy is not enough.

145
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:49.820
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

146
00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:56.489
Anthony Taylor: defend your choice. So if you want to tell me after stuff. You gotta defend it.

147
00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:58.550
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

148
00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:11.149
Anthony Taylor: Describe the limitations of all of the different metrics. Describe overfitting detect over fitting. We've talked about that so much that should be easy. Adjust the model to optimize

149
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:19.919
Anthony Taylor: between over and under. So here, with first time, we're really going to get into the details of, how do we handle this?

150
00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.380
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

151
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:30.059
Anthony Taylor: I see you, son. I see what you're saying.

152
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:37.500
Anthony Taylor: Sorry I went through whatever I said. Not 2 websites. Sunday too

153
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:43.760
Anthony Taylor: cool first born and sophomore. Okay, good. Alright.

154
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:49.730
Anthony Taylor: as far as the general requirements and architecture like I said, well.

155
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:55.769
Anthony Taylor: it's so hard to get into Llm. Architecture. But what we need I will cover.

156
00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:01.170
Anthony Taylor: Okay. alright. So why are we doing this?

157
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.889
Anthony Taylor: Well, we trained models.

158
00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:10.300
Anthony Taylor: We've we've we've trained clustering models. We've trained regression models. And we've trained classification models.

159
00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:14.040
Anthony Taylor: We are moving right along. Okay.

160
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:17.140
Anthony Taylor:  And

161
00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:22.969
Anthony Taylor: while we're looking at this historic data, and it's finding these patterns.

162
00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.849
Anthony Taylor: what we worry about

163
00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:29.170
Anthony Taylor: is is is, is is it right?

164
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:40.250
Anthony Taylor: And how do we know, I mean, what do you? You know what? What's the damage? If we're wrong if we do this model and we score it. And it says you're 95% accurate. And everything is awesome. And we're like.

165
00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.579
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and and then we're wrong.

166
00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:49.059
Anthony Taylor: It could be money, it could be reputation. It could be a lot

167
00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:56.239
Anthony Taylor: alright. And and how could we be wrong? It said it was 95%. Right? Well, while that's true

168
00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:05.290
Anthony Taylor: that it was only measuring one aspect of model, we've mostly been focusing on accuracy and and or R 2 spoils.

169
00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:16.100
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But this reason, and you're gonna see why that's not actually best way to score, or at the very least, the only way to score

170
00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:21.800
Anthony Taylor: so overfitting while we talked about overfitting excessive. Okay,

171
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:27.239
Anthony Taylor: overfitting is just when it and I'm gonna be honest with you guys, what I've started doing.

172
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:30.609
Anthony Taylor: Not this one wanna move this over here?

173
00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:41.419
Anthony Taylor:  is. Yeah. I have this data data pro, Professor Gpt, I created, which is supposed to be me. But in a Gpt.

174
00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:45.450
Anthony Taylor: and I asked it to give me some some

175
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.960
Anthony Taylor: interesting examples.

176
00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:57.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so overfitting. Imagine if your model is that one student in class

177
00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.870
Anthony Taylor: who memorizes the entire textbook.

178
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:05.230
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But can't apply those concepts of your life

179
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.150
Anthony Taylor: that's overfitting

180
00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:15.930
Anthony Taylor: it performs fantastic on our training data, but doesn't do very well on data. It hasn't seen before.

181
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:21.230
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So one of those like autistic savants that can memorize entire book.

182
00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:23.609
Anthony Taylor: But you know. can't.

183
00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:27.019
Anthony Taylor: you know, can't do like basic skills.

184
00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.880
Clayton Graves: Okay, so what?

185
00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:33.610
Clayton Graves: But you also are incapable of memorizing a better textbook.

186
00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.170
Anthony Taylor: So well, we're gonna get to that, Clayton. That's a great question.

187
00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.709
Anthony Taylor: So

188
00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:44.099
Anthony Taylor: so the way we avoid this, we we regularly.

189
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:52.520
Anthony Taylor: regularization is like telling that same person. Hey? You don't need to memorize the entire Internet. Just get the gist of it.

190
00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.510
Anthony Taylor: Okay, read the summary of every chat.

191
00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.069
Anthony Taylor: You'll need the detail.

192
00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.540
Anthony Taylor: Alright. That's what we basically wanted to do.

193
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:06.780
Anthony Taylor: Okay, underfitting is exactly opposite.

194
00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:10.959
Anthony Taylor: Person. Got the book, and they read the table of contents and said, They know everything.

195
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:14.950
Anthony Taylor: I

196
00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:22.709
Anthony Taylor: they clearly don't. They're not going to be able to answer hardly any of the questions right? They might get some, but they certainly aren't going to get them all

197
00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:28.310
Anthony Taylor: okay. And of course, that's where we say we kind of go back to the same

198
00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:33.910
Anthony Taylor: result. Hey? At least go get the summaries. Don't just read the table content.

199
00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:38.430
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So the the kind of nice in the middle

200
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:43.579
Anthony Taylor: is. Go, read the summary alright, that's what we want our model to do.

201
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:51.669
Anthony Taylor: So misinterpretation. This the bottom line is. This is when you get that score, and it says, 96. And you're like

202
00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:52.620
Anthony Taylor: done.

203
00:18:54.110 --> 00:19:01.750
Anthony Taylor: But then we go and look at it a little heavier, and we see, oh, wait! That's 96% of 95% of the data.

204
00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.390
Anthony Taylor: which means that

205
00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:08.380
Anthony Taylor: we didn't even really judge the other classification.

206
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:10.749
Anthony Taylor: So we don't. We're not close

207
00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:15.709
Anthony Taylor:  And the best way to avoid this

208
00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:21.100
Anthony Taylor: always question and use more than one score. Okay.

209
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.860
right?

210
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.990
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

211
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.789
Anthony Taylor: So we have this bank marketing data. We're going to go. Take a look at it in just second

212
00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.970
Anthony Taylor: it consists of 17 columns.

213
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:41.789
Anthony Taylor: 4,500.2 rows. The columns represent variables that consist of integer categories, binary and data formats.

214
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:43.200
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

215
00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.169
Anthony Taylor: in this table, I'll go ahead and open it up and show it to you.

216
00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:04.020
Anthony Taylor: So this is the data that we're talking about. We see age. We see job marital marital

217
00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.830
Anthony Taylor: all of these fun.

218
00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:14.720
Anthony Taylor:  and different. you know. Data. fields. Okay.

219
00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:19.920
Anthony Taylor: alright, good. Sorry. I wanted to make sure I got all of theirs.

220
00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.030
Anthony Taylor: Huh? So

221
00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:27.080
Anthony Taylor: looking at this data.

222
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:36.430
Anthony Taylor: we we're we're looking for what the target variable is. Now, they were really nice, and they gave us a variable called Via a column

223
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:43.869
Anthony Taylor: called, why? So? My question is. looking at this data. what is? Why.

224
00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.350
Anthony Taylor: that's that's a question for the room.

225
00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.009
Clayton Graves: I guess I don't know how right?

226
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.540
Based on

227
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:16.480
Clayton Graves: on the data that I'm seeing here. I'm guessing this is creditworthiness

228
00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:26.750
Anthony Taylor: could be. Yeah, that makes. I mean, it is a banks marketing campaign, though.

229
00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:34.119
Clayton Graves: Yeah. But you're not gonna market to people that are defaulting on their loans. You're gonna market unqualified.

230
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:37.949
Anthony Taylor: I like that, too, but it I mean it could be almost anything.

231
00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.740
Baro, Sonja: So it

232
00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.290
michael mcpherson: I got sorry, son.

233
00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:48.590
Baro, Sonja: I was gonna say, like new accounts or cause. See that talks about campaigns? 1, 2, 3.

234
00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:51.499
Baro, Sonja: So they have different marketing campaigns.

235
00:21:51.690 --> 00:22:03.339
Baro, Sonja: The other information is about the but they know about the target of the person right? That they're targeting. And the yes no might be. Did they get a response?

236
00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:05.489
Baro, Sonja: I don't know, that's true.

237
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:08.999
Anthony Taylor: But then look at this end. One here, guys, the P. Outcome

238
00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:13.650
Baro, Sonja: says failure. And this is the only one that says, yes, that's kind of interesting.

239
00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:26.159
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I don't think there's any way to know from the data I mean, it could be whoever ha! Whatever! Submitted the application in August cause. That's the only august one like we. We don't know.

240
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.049
Anthony Taylor: That's a really really good answer, Mike. Did you have an answer?

241
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:32.900
michael mcpherson: It looks like

242
00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:40.870
michael mcpherson: like they're bundling things together for for ratings.

243
00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.849
michael mcpherson: like security rating

244
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:43.900
like

245
00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:51.170
Anthony Taylor: I like it. I like it. And and it could be good

246
00:22:52.320 --> 00:23:02.550
michael mcpherson: like that. It could also be something for the like one of the reg bank regulatories. You know, because they have to have

247
00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:10.260
michael mcpherson: so many loans have to be within certain parameters before they can continue to give out loans

248
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:11.979
michael mcpherson: on the back end

249
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:13.340
Anthony Taylor: come with you.

250
00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.839
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So this is the first problem we're gonna run into

251
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:19.129
Anthony Taylor: when we're doing this job.

252
00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:22.970
Anthony Taylor: Alright, you're gonna have all this data that data looks great. You're gonna

253
00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:29.659
Anthony Taylor: did not need to do that. You're gonna get to a point where you first thing you gotta do is figure out target. What does it mean?

254
00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:34.409
Anthony Taylor: Alright, now, we're not gonna worry too much about it. Right now, I'm just gonna move on.

255
00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.739
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna build a model. We know, Y is our label.

256
00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:39.109
Anthony Taylor: whatever it is.

257
00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:45.239
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna move on. Okay. So the first thing so we're gonna do and everyone do this is now the second activity

258
00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:52.770
Anthony Taylor: for those that are wondering. and we need to drop in a so how do I drop in a

259
00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:57.750
Anthony Taylor: well, my first, I will give you this. I'm gonna create a data frame

260
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.870
Anthony Taylor: called data frame clean. And I need to drop all of the nulls

261
00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:05.819
Anthony Taylor: in this data frame. How do I do that

262
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:17.980
Anthony Taylor: drop in a Anthony? Oh, my God, that's it!

263
00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:19.110
Clayton Graves: Yep.

264
00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:23.319
Anthony Taylor: II was gonna wait. I was totally planning on starting to sing a song.

265
00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:27.209
michael mcpherson: Okay, we're also making sure that was an actual question.

266
00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:37.019
Anthony Taylor: Well, if I'm pause, what do you think I'll do it like it's like thinking about it. I don't know. How do I hope someone speaks, Anthony.

267
00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:38.860
Masarirambi, Rodney: trying to sound tricky

268
00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:40.850
Masarirambi, Rodney: and dramatically.

269
00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:46.990
michael mcpherson: Yeah, we only hear about 75% of the words you say we don't hear any of the words. You don't

270
00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:48.780
Masarirambi, Rodney: wait. That higher

271
00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.199
Anthony Taylor: is my is my connection bad? Some?

272
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.270
Masarirambi, Rodney: No, he's joking.

273
00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:02.270
Anthony Taylor: Oh, oh. so, in other words, you're just not this. I got

274
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.730
Anthony Taylor: alright. So we're going to

275
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:07.260
Anthony Taylor: what?

276
00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:08.550
Clayton Graves: What?

277
00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:16.419
Anthony Taylor: Alright? So yeah, now we have to do something with our label, because right now it's what was it? Yes, no.

278
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:24.860
Anthony Taylor: right? So we need to. We can do a couple of things. We can get dummies, which is what we're gonna do

279
00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:29.609
Anthony Taylor: we could use label encoder. But get dummies works if you use it

280
00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:38.509
Anthony Taylor: properly. Okay, so how am I going to do that? Well, I'm going to say. give me that y variable

281
00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.220
Anthony Taylor: and

282
00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:49.879
Anthony Taylor:  but that's what we're gonna do get dummies on. But we're gonna drop first. You guys remember what that does

283
00:25:54.020 --> 00:26:01.919
Anthony Taylor: so in the event or so, no matter how many you have. Remember the whole Saturday, Monday to Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

284
00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:09.009
Anthony Taylor: and we said, Do we really need 7 variables? Or could we get away with 6? So if they're all 0, it's the seventh one.

285
00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:15.579
Anthony Taylor: right? So that's basically what drop first does so in this case there's only 2. Yes, no.

286
00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:27.009
Anthony Taylor: So if we say, drop first, there's only one column, and it'll either be 0 or what. So that works out. I will tell you. You want to use D type equals int here.

287
00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:29.550
Anthony Taylor: Otherwise it will break

288
00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:38.440
Anthony Taylor: that's not in the solution, for when you guys get the solution. Don't look at it. Okay, good.

289
00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:39.520
Anthony Taylor: Hi.

290
00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:44.489
Anthony Taylor: so let's get rid of the this is why it will break. By the way, if you don't

291
00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.129
Anthony Taylor: type int it'll do true, false.

292
00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:51.770
Anthony Taylor: And then when you do this next line, it'll it'll drop it. It's not good thing.

293
00:26:51.930 --> 00:27:03.350
Anthony Taylor: So now we're going to get. We're only going to select the values in this data frame that are numerous. Okay, so we're going to say, Df clean.

294
00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.269
Anthony Taylor: does anybody remember this one

295
00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:15.740
Anthony Taylor: select underscore D types. Okay? And which ones are we gonna select? We're gonna include

296
00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:21.120
Anthony Taylor: number. So all this is gonna do is select only

297
00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:22.529
Anthony Taylor: the numbers.

298
00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.289
Clayton Graves: What about what about float?

299
00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:31.270
Clayton Graves: Well, a number works. Number will pick up every number.

300
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:36.949
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but that's good. That's a good question. Alright. And then it says Verify, we'll just do that with the info.

301
00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:43.969
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Could you also do a look like a filter and get anything? Well, you'd have to

302
00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:53.829
Anthony Taylor: you. You can't filter. I mean, you can filter on d types. But it would not be as easy as this. This is definitely. But that's a good good point.

303
00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.880
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so

304
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:58.109
Anthony Taylor: if you remember to do this.

305
00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:06.219
Anthony Taylor: you will see all of the columns that had numbers in. Just just so, you guys know, this was a bug in the solution. By the way.

306
00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:10.350
Anthony Taylor:  when you run this notice, y's not there.

307
00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.930
Clayton Graves: I did not. Tons of objects.

308
00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:17.890
Clayton Graves: tons of objects.

309
00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:22.959
Anthony Taylor: So you have to do d type equals. Int. What are you talking about on this?

310
00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:30.660
Clayton Graves: On the info. the the resulting info. You must have a problem in your thing I got.

311
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.510
Anthony Taylor: Did you do exactly what I did?

312
00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.609
Clayton Graves: I am double checking now

313
00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:50.089
Dipinto, Matt: we can. We can take a quick peek if you want. And your third line, did you redefine df, clean as df clean like? Did you reestablish the variable cause? If you just did that line? Without that you would have maintained all your objects.

314
00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:52.880
Oh, nice! Call

315
00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:54.770
Anthony Taylor: alright! Just show us that.

316
00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:02.399
Clayton Graves: I think what he just said, is it? But hold on, I'll show it.

317
00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:14.360
Anthony Taylor: That was it.

318
00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:24.300
Anthony Taylor: Alright! I'm pretty damn impressed that you got that without even looking at it. Nope, backspace one more.

319
00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:27.690
Anthony Taylor: Well, that worked. Okay. Never mind. Good job.

320
00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:30.959
Anthony Taylor: That's pretty good.

321
00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:35.390
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we're all on same page.

322
00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:40.390
Clayton Graves: We all have a data frame. Just test numbers.

323
00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:52.269
Anthony Taylor: Good job, Matt. Oh. I did try to get Matt to join us as a TA. Next session, and he said, Hell! No. almost that loud, too.

324
00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:59.039
Kanouff, Christine: No freaking way, or maybe he just well enough to know the kind of mistakes I'd make.

325
00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:00.869
Kanouff, Christine: There's that, too.

326
00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:10.890
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So now we're gonna basically do our X and Y, we're gonna do this same as we've been doing the last week or so we're just gonna come in here. We're gonna drop

327
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:15.010
Anthony Taylor:  test.

328
00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:18.579
Anthony Taylor: Sorry. I just got the weirdest message

329
00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:29.040
Anthony Taylor: on my phone. It just said it said to me. Print error. I made an outback buttercake over the weekend.

330
00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:38.610
Anthony Taylor: and I printed it out on Friday, and it just now told me that it it failed. Okay, anyway, I don't know why, now decided to tell me that.

331
00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:42.990
Anthony Taylor: And it was very good. By the way, Mike.

332
00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:44.740
Anthony Taylor: sinfully dead it was.

333
00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:49.420
Anthony Taylor: I still have some. If you guys want some. Okay.

334
00:30:49.690 --> 00:31:00.590
Anthony Taylor: so our X, we've dropped the Y column or Y, we're only taking the Y column. and we are done. And now

335
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:02.490
Anthony Taylor: we're going to.

336
00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:16.450
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

337
00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:18.730
Anthony Taylor: I have to check some.

338
00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:21.599
michael mcpherson: Yeah, that's what I thought.

339
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.740
Anthony Taylor: No, that's not the problem. I mean, thank you for bringing that up. But this is not what's in the solution.

340
00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:32.879
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna change this to what's in the solution. So we're gonna do an ensemble method.

341
00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:36.599
Anthony Taylor: And the one we're gonna do is random forest.

342
00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.690
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

343
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:42.240
Anthony Taylor:  So let's do model

344
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:48.550
Anthony Taylor: equals random forest classifier. Initialize that.

345
00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:51.780
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then let's fit it

346
00:31:56.430 --> 00:32:01.239
Anthony Taylor: nice. And then last, but not least, let's score it

347
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:08.650
Anthony Taylor: alright. Look at that score. Woo!

348
00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:14.659
Anthony Taylor: This is the greatest model of all time.

349
00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:21.860
Anthony Taylor: Thoughts. questions. Are you skeptical?

350
00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:25.790
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Do any like train test splits

351
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:27.400
Anthony Taylor: what?

352
00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:33.839
Anthony Taylor: We didn't? Actually, you're right. So we totally forgot to do that. What else could we do

353
00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:35.570
Anthony Taylor: wrong? Did we do wrong?

354
00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:42.420
Anthony Taylor: What else was not? We didn't scale or standardize anything

355
00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:47.100
Anthony Taylor:  accurate as well.

356
00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:49.819
Anthony Taylor: what else

357
00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:58.349
Clayton Graves: we we trained on the entire model, we didn't

358
00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:10.939
Anthony Taylor: test split definitely. Not good. I mean, how can we tell if our data works? If it's or if it's over fit, we don't have any testing. So that's 1, 2. We didn't standard scale

359
00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.719
Anthony Taylor: that definitely could have contributed to this.

360
00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:20.450
Anthony Taylor: There's 2 other things that I would love to hear one. We just started talking about today.

361
00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:26.979
Anthony Taylor: and the other one we've I've talked about probably a hundred times

362
00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:29.380
Clayton Graves: he had used multiple models.

363
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:37.990
Derek Rikke: Well, that's good. But that's that's not what I'm looking for here you dropped. Like most of the data.

364
00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:43.479
Anthony Taylor: we have no idea how much we drop. Right? We probably did drop most of the data.

365
00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:47.079
Anthony Taylor: But we definitely did just a blind drop in aid which was lame.

366
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:55.490
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So there's one, or there's the second one. What's the last thing that we just started talking about today

367
00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:59.160
Anthony Taylor: that we should be taking into account.

368
00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:03.270
Raugewitz, Tania: I'll give you a big hand. Oh, go tight.

369
00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:05.409
Raugewitz, Tania: Do we do multiple scores?

370
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:11.050
Anthony Taylor: Exactly. We're we're basically counting on just the actress's score. Now.

371
00:34:11.239 --> 00:34:15.749
I don't know that I've actually told you this, but the accuracy score. I know you know I know I have.

372
00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:24.280
Anthony Taylor: but the accuracy score is saying that I predicted this. And this is the actual answer, and they are the same.

373
00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:26.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

374
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:32.040
Anthony Taylor: so, and it gives you the percentage that are, in fact, the same.

375
00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:37.249
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So in this case it's saying that everything I predicted

376
00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:41.680
Anthony Taylor: matches the value that's in the thing. But this is the training data.

377
00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:47.719
Anthony Taylor: Alright. We literally trained it and tested it on the same data. Yes, fine.

378
00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:52.490
Raugewitz, Tania: Okay, so this is probably remedial question. But

379
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:58.680
Raugewitz, Tania: so you know, I've heard the model fit predict and score. When did we predict?

380
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:18.859
Anthony Taylor: Well, the sc. So model fit predict, predict, predict is a step you could do if you you know you could. You could do predict now. Okay. And that would be fine. Score runs to predict as well, but then gives you the score. So if you were outputting the predictions like to a data frame or something, you would run predict by itself.

381
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.339
Anthony Taylor: yeah, score just runs the predict and then gives you the output or the the ratio. Yes, Meredith.

382
00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:43.440
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I know you sort of mentioned this, but we didn't even look at the data before we did any cleaning, and it looks like it's got like 33,000 rows, almost 34,000. And then, after the dropping things, we had like 5,000 rows, like we almost 6,000 like we dropped a massive amount of data.

383
00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:51.650
Anthony Taylor: That's right. So just dropping drop in a so so the whole point of this lesson, believe it or not, was to get you guys to identify

384
00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:56.339
Anthony Taylor: 3 major things. And even though it didn't mention standard scalar. I think that's a good one. So 4

385
00:35:56.470 --> 00:36:05.210
Anthony Taylor: and that is, we dropped in a blindly. We did not train test split, so we have nothing to look at to judge our model against.

386
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:11.520
Anthony Taylor: And we are only looking at the accuracy score which it tells us we did. Great.

387
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:18.510
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But we don't know if this data set is imbalanced. what is imbalance?

388
00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:21.399
Anthony Taylor: Well, if 90%

389
00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:30.160
Anthony Taylor: of these values actually here, we can look at it right here. we could say, df.

390
00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:31.990
Anthony Taylor: why

391
00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.800
Anthony Taylor: always do the extra practice?

392
00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:38.140
Anthony Taylor: Dot value counts, and this is cleaned.

393
00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:41.280
Anthony Taylor: We can see that we have

394
00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:45.539
Anthony Taylor: almost 5. Well, 4 times

395
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:49.510
Anthony Taylor: as many knows as we do. Yeses.

396
00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:53.539
Anthony Taylor: our data is terribly imbalanced.

397
00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:58.339
Anthony Taylor: Alright, we have way more no's than we do. Yes.

398
00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:06.030
Anthony Taylor: which is yet another problem, and accuracy particularly does bad in the scenario.

399
00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:11.190
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So that was the point of that. Exercise

400
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:17.579
Meredith McCanse (she/her): is an ideal is an ideal scenario where the target would be about roughly, half and half.

401
00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:24.660
Anthony Taylor: Yes, but there are exercises that we will do later.

402
00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:33.789
Anthony Taylor: probably this week, where we will try to to handle this. There's also ways. There's also fours that this doesn't bother as much

403
00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:43.830
Anthony Taylor: is because, remember, accuracy is only looking. Did I guess right? That's it. It's not taking into account the stuff that it gets wrong.

404
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:52.319
Anthony Taylor: It's saying I got it right. 95% of the time. Well, if 95% of your data is all one value, that's not that impressive.

405
00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:59.120
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but if if you are looking at falses, and if we're gonna get into all of that.

406
00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:02.360
Anthony Taylor: okay, that's the point. Alright.

407
00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:07.120
Anthony Taylor: So

408
00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:12.720
Anthony Taylor: this one is another. We're all gonna talk amongst are out loud in class. Okay?

409
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:18.920
Anthony Taylor:  what we're looking for here is

410
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:20.400
Anthony Taylor: the best

411
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:30.149
Anthony Taylor: target column. So this is your Y variable. This is what you're trying to predict. Okay, so I'm going to give you a scenario.

412
00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:34.970
Anthony Taylor: And then you guys yell it out. Raise your hand whatever you want.

413
00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:40.530
Anthony Taylor: And you guys are going to tell me what you think we should do for the target.

414
00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:49.259
Anthony Taylor: Okay, first scenario. A medical dataset contains hospital intake information on thousands patients.

415
00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.649
Anthony Taylor: Don't worry about it.

416
00:38:51.260 --> 00:39:01.220
Anthony Taylor: The hospital would like to use machine learning to help them make better decisions about which patients to be so prescribed antibiotics.

417
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:02.370
Anthony Taylor: So

418
00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:10.209
Anthony Taylor: let me just open the floor. See what kind of ideas you guys have. Let's see if we're on the right path

419
00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:12.859
Anthony Taylor: before I give like an example.

420
00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:18.569
Anthony Taylor: So what kind of date? What kind of target should we predict? Go click.

421
00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:26.830
Clayton Graves: okay? So you're looking for target data as opposed to what data would be appropriate, not the supportive data necessary.

422
00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:31.810
Anthony Taylor: It's hard to say allergies. But yeah, allergies is a good one.

423
00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:33.730
Anthony Taylor: That's a fair

424
00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:37.120
Anthony Taylor: that's a fair example.

425
00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:39.450
michael mcpherson: Nice

426
00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:42.990
Anthony Taylor: does. Does allergy always require an antibiotic?

427
00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:47.430
Clayton Graves: Never hope you can be allergic to penicillin

428
00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:56.269
Anthony Taylor: that that's true. But but remember our qua and and guys, I gotta be honest with you. This is the point of this exercise is, I'm gonna

429
00:39:56.380 --> 00:40:02.460
Anthony Taylor: unless someone hits it dead on the head, which is almost impossible. I am going to play devil's advocate

430
00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:13.309
Anthony Taylor: and push back on your different suggestions. Okay, so in your in this case, they want to make better decisions about which patients should prescribe antibiotics. Allergies alone would not be enough.

431
00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:17.890
Anthony Taylor: Or would it be even any help at all? I don't know. Yeah, Mike.

432
00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.310
Anthony Taylor: Oh, wait, let's let's keep going.

433
00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:23.380
michael mcpherson: So like the simps symptoms

434
00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:27.909
michael mcpherson: versus what's currently going around. That's viral.

435
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:32.790
Anthony Taylor: So that's a feature set. We're looking for a target variable.

436
00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:39.919
Anthony Taylor: So let me give you an example. Would a binary column that indicates whether or not a patient was diagnosed with an infection?

437
00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:45.020
Clayton Graves: So they're diagnosed? Yeah. So yes. Tx.

438
00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:50.810
Anthony Taylor: what do you guys think overall? I hear? Yes or 2? Yeses.

439
00:40:51.380 --> 00:41:00.720
Dipinto, Matt: No, it's not target. The target is, should they be prescribed antibiotics. So it's a binary yes or no, with all the features, if they have an infection, is a feature.

440
00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.660
Anthony Taylor: it would be absolutely

441
00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:08.529
Anthony Taylor: and by itself again. Not every infection requires an antibiotic

442
00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:11.630
Baro, Sonja: right? I know that's weird. Most of them do. But

443
00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:16.680
Anthony Taylor: okay, how about a binary column that indicates whether or not a patient responded well

444
00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:20.380
Anthony Taylor: to antibiotics while in the hospital. Is that a good target

445
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:22.029
Anthony Taylor: to get this answer?

446
00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:24.950
Baro, Sonja: Maybe

447
00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:31.460
Clayton Graves: I don't think so, because we're the the the scenario is asking

448
00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:43.809
Clayton Graves: or help making better decisions about which patients should be prescribed antibiotics and how they reacted to antibiotics.

449
00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:50.220
Clayton Graves: I don't. I don't think that that's pertinent. I think that maybe maybe past

450
00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:55.230
Clayton Graves: past reactions to antibiotics might help. But

451
00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:58.379
Clayton Graves: ultimately the question is it met

452
00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:05.159
Clayton Graves: kid on the head? Was. should these patients be prescribed antibiotics or not. Yes or no.

453
00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:10.220
Anthony Taylor: Right? Okay, so is that gonna be the target variable?

454
00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:13.239
Clayton Graves: I think so. It makes sense.

455
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:22.219
Baro, Sonja: Alright. Alright, I'm not against that. I'm not saying that's wrong. You might be talking past each other there.

456
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:23.550
Baro, Sonja: So

457
00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:25.949
I think Clayton's saying the question is.

458
00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:33.430
Baro, Sonja: did you say the target is whether or not yes or no. Should they be prescribed antibiotics?

459
00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:37.339
Baro, Sonja: It doesn't have to be by Mary, just to be clear.

460
00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:39.659
Anthony Taylor: You could have multi-class here, too. Some.

461
00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:46.049
Clayton Graves: yes, but if they've already been prescribed antibiotics, then the question is moved.

462
00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:48.729
Baro, Sonja: that's about.

463
00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:54.319
Baro, Sonja: I don't agree with that. because they could be prophylactic

464
00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:01.470
Baro, Sonja: types of antibiotic use as well. So just because they've had them in the past

465
00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:05.130
Baro, Sonja: doesn't mean it's not relevant.

466
00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:10.380
Clayton Graves: Ambiotics serve different purposes.

467
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:16.169
Clayton Graves: I agree with that. Oxygen is not, gonna and penicillin won't cure everything.

468
00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:26.050
michael mcpherson: But sometimes you you need something more some an antibiotic. That's specific to that particular type of infection.

469
00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:35.820
michael mcpherson: That is true. Uti my, my initial assertion.

470
00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:41.080
Anthony Taylor: Hold on now, yeah. Can't talk over each other alright. Go, go, hey.

471
00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:44.089
Anthony Taylor: Layton! And then Meredith.

472
00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:48.290
Anthony Taylor: and then playing your muted Buddy.

473
00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:58.419
Clayton Graves: My sorry, my, my, my! My initial assertion was.

474
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.770
Clayton Graves: we're trying to determine

475
00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:09.330
Clayton Graves: whether or not somebody should have should be given prescribed antibiotics.

476
00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:11.000
Clayton Graves: and they're in the hospital.

477
00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:14.839
Clayton Graves: and they just were prescribed antibiotics in the hospital.

478
00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:19.899
Clayton Graves: Then this question doesn't need to be asked, because they've already been given antibiotics.

479
00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:30.210
Clayton Graves: II wasn't really concerned about the past, but the way the question was was presented was, they're in the hospital. They just had antibiotics. How did they respond to those antibiotics.

480
00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:33.999
Clayton Graves: Should we prescribe antibiotics? You just did.

481
00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:40.290
Anthony Taylor: Well, maybe. Yeah. Okay, Meredith, we're gonna get past this question after Rodney.

482
00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:49.679
Meredith McCanse (she/her): If it yeah. If the response. If the target can be multi class, then what if the target is that? The diagnosis itself?

483
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:58.600
Meredith McCanse (she/her): And then so then, after that, that doesn't necessarily say, I see where you're going. So if the diagnosis is diagnosis that

484
00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:02.629
Anthony Taylor: normally requires antibiotics, you could make that assumption

485
00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:06.120
Anthony Taylor: right? But this is to tell us

486
00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:16.020
Anthony Taylor: we want a machine learning model that will help us make better better decisions about which patients should be prescribed, antibiotics, not which diagnosis should be prescribed antibiotics.

487
00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:19.470
Anthony Taylor: So is it possible that well, go ahead.

488
00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:26.429
Meredith McCanse (she/her): But if but if antibiotics are a standard protocol for certain diagnoses.

489
00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:37.479
Meredith McCanse (she/her): then that's not a prediction right? Right? Well, no, but the prediction would be the diagnosis. And then you have to rely on rules for like which one which of these diagnoses, then.

490
00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:41.180
Meredith McCanse (she/her): would be candidates for

491
00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:45.270
Meredith McCanse (she/her):  antibiotics.

492
00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:51.429
Anthony Taylor: I mean, it's not wrong like I said, not really. Anybody's gonna be wrong on this. But that's not bad. Alright, Rodney. What you got

493
00:45:55.220 --> 00:46:05.570
Masarirambi, Rodney: actually, no, not anymore.

494
00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:13.930
Clayton Graves: Target. Because think about it. Right? John Wayne Bobbitt. those of you who remember him

495
00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:16.919
Clayton Graves: you don't need. You think you're

496
00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:29.120
Clayton Graves: antibiotics are going to really help return that right. But at the same time antibiotics might be described as prescribed as part of the treatment after the operation.

497
00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:37.030
Anthony Taylor: Well, good. He probably needed a technic shot or 2. He would have had antibiotics like

498
00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:41.119
Masarirambi, Rodney: when he was being checked in before anything else was done, to make sure there was no affection.

499
00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:45.239
Masarirambi, Rodney: so I guess so, coming back to what I was, where I was going was like

500
00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:48.249
Masarirambi, Rodney: depending on the symptoms.

501
00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:54.689
Masarirambi, Rodney: We can use the history to say these are symptoms that the person has come in with.

502
00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:58.570
Masarirambi, Rodney: and try to predict that, based off of those symptoms.

503
00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:06.930
Masarirambi, Rodney: Did they? Well, because the training is like based on those systems. Did we actually prescribe them antibiotics? And if we use that to

504
00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:10.870
Masarirambi, Rodney: to predict, because we already have that information

505
00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:14.049
Masarirambi, Rodney: as to whether they have intake information.

506
00:47:14.090 --> 00:47:21.109
Anthony Taylor: Apply that logic to a burden. You know what we kind of stepped away, because, look, we only have intake information

507
00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:34.439
Anthony Taylor: alright, even even that's where it fell apart, because we don't have all that diagnosis information. Apply that logic to a burn victim who just came in and and is doing intake.

508
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:38.620
Clayton Graves: Apply. The logic does. Does an antibiotic

509
00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:42.310
Clayton Graves: help with the burn? No, but

510
00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:47.049
Clayton Graves: it might be prescribed afterwards to keep away infection.

511
00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:51.220
Anthony Taylor: Alright! Alright, alright. Let's move on, Jennifer. You're up.

512
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:54.949
Jennifer Dahlgren: The only thing that I was going to say is.

513
00:47:55.880 --> 00:48:02.970
Jennifer Dahlgren: we use past information to predict future, and I think we're missing that in our discussion. And so, because of that.

514
00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:21.049
Jennifer Dahlgren: our outcome variable has to be, you know, something that we can easily see from the intake. They had this outcome, which is actually, if they were prescribed prescriptions in the first place, and then you can create a model based upon those 2 things.

515
00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:24.159
Clayton Graves: I accept that. That's good.

516
00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:28.280
Anthony Taylor: Alright, alright! Let's move on to the next question. We got 3 of these. Okay.

517
00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:29.549
Anthony Taylor: the next one.

518
00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:38.409
Anthony Taylor: Oh, here's some. Oh, here's some choices that they came up with. Maybe I'll show you guys these choices. We could that way. We could keep it focused on the choices that they came up with

519
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:47.709
Anthony Taylor:  stock market data set contains data on every trade of a particular company has made in previous 5 years.

520
00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:54.329
Anthony Taylor: The company would like to use machine learning to predict whether a trade will be profitable before you answer.

521
00:48:54.770 --> 00:49:00.030
Anthony Taylor: Here are 3 options. You can come up with more. But let's try to focus on this

522
00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:05.360
Anthony Taylor: target column choice a a column that gives total profit or loss from each trade.

523
00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:12.189
Anthony Taylor: a column that gives it the percentage, profit or loss from each train.

524
00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:13.780
Anthony Taylor: So those are regression.

525
00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:20.280
Anthony Taylor: a binary column that indicates whether a trade made at least 10% profit.

526
00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:24.569
Anthony Taylor: but which one you guys like and why.

527
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:26.310
michael mcpherson: hey?

528
00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:31.010
Anthony Taylor: A Y

529
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:36.579
michael mcpherson: dollars and cents make more sense than percentages

530
00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:38.420
michael mcpherson: if you're trying to calculate it.

531
00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:40.250
Dipinto, Matt: And I personally disagree.

532
00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:46.690
Dipinto, Matt: If you made a you know, a $20 investment

533
00:49:47.220 --> 00:50:03.369
Dipinto, Matt: on a stock that you chose for certain criteria, and that stock grew by 1,000 times. But the rest of your company trades on 1 billion dollars. There was something right with that $20 investment. But it wouldn't ever make the list. If you don't change it into percentage.

534
00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:07.609
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I like that.

535
00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:16.519
Clayton Graves: I will also submit that on between B and C. But I have no opinion between the 2 non-committal.

536
00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:26.450
Clayton Graves: but I think that it plays into mass logic there, too, that that you know again, the same scenario.

537
00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:31.300
Clayton Graves: It increases by a thousand dollars. But you trade in the millions, 10% profit.

538
00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:34.530
Clayton Graves: It looks good for them, because

539
00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:37.749
michael mcpherson: not with a thousand bucks, it wouldn't even show up.

540
00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.590
michael mcpherson: This is asking for a

541
00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:47.300
michael mcpherson: algorithmic. It's using previous data to see whether the next trade of this particular stock

542
00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:59.600
michael mcpherson: is worth it. That's it's asking. So it's not going to be how much it and it's a percentage. It's like I traded this stock at this price and pulled back this much

543
00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:01.290
michael mcpherson: of each trade. It

544
00:51:02.050 --> 00:51:03.700
michael mcpherson: I'm still gonna go with a

545
00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:18.809
Dipinto, Matt: it could be asking, based on company profile like, based on certain characteristics about a generic company like. what are the features of a company that will produce a 10% profit. So it doesn't have to be unique to you know that

546
00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:20.440
Dipinto, Matt: stock.

547
00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:26.369
Dipinto, Matt: Well, in this particular case it's just one stock one company wants to know.

548
00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:39.129
Anthony Taylor: So so let's talk about some shortcomings of the first one. Right? So the biggest thing is is. you know, does. If if you invested 50 bucks and you made 51 bucks a regression model. It's gonna show you. You made one note.

549
00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:41.820
Anthony Taylor: Maybe that's good. Maybe that maybe not

550
00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:45.700
Anthony Taylor: right. But if you buy a lot of stuff and we're

551
00:51:45.990 --> 00:52:01.140
Anthony Taylor: going on profit. And that stock you bought a hundred of them. You made $100 in profit. Okay? So now your profit looks pretty decent on the chart. But is that as useful as a percentage

552
00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:17.510
Anthony Taylor: percentage would be much more useful, and say, Oh, well. you know, I bought. you know, $5,000 in stock. But I only got 1% increase. Okay, so that gives you a a little better choice when you're talking about varying number

553
00:52:17.570 --> 00:52:20.510
Anthony Taylor: of stocks. But

554
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:25.690
Anthony Taylor: okay, the the binary call the classifier.

555
00:52:26.070 --> 00:52:33.080
Anthony Taylor: So once we go into this, we start going into classification instead of regression. Now, I've told you before.

556
00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:45.430
Anthony Taylor: classification way. Easier, lots more tunable things like that. But here's the problem with that. And I think Matt or Mike, or somebody kind of touched on this. But what if it's less than 10% profit?

557
00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:46.770
Anthony Taylor: Now.

558
00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:50.359
Anthony Taylor: if you invested 50 bucks.

559
00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:54.610
Anthony Taylor: 5 blacks who kiss you invested 5 million

560
00:52:55.170 --> 00:52:58.199
Anthony Taylor: and you made a 3%. Profit.

561
00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:00.699
Anthony Taylor: You're still feeling pretty good.

562
00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:09.149
Anthony Taylor: Okay. yeah, a lot. Right? So so you know, maybe 10% is too much.

563
00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:24.389
Anthony Taylor: you know. But again, the point of this is not necessarily to find the right answer. It's to go through the exercise of trying to figure out what the right target variables would be maybe too much, but you could tune it.

564
00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:29.529
Anthony Taylor: Of course you could. I love that absolutely, absolutely. Oh, Meredith.

565
00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:42.050
Meredith McCanse (she/her): can you do? Is it possible to do something where you do like. It's over 10% and $50,000, or something like that, like it has to meet more than one criteria.

566
00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:43.249
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Or is that? Not?

567
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:46.970
Anthony Taylor: Of course you can. Yeah, you could do that. Sure.

568
00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:51.330
Anthony Taylor: I mean, the prediction is, gonna be the prediction. So what you would do is you would just click, click.

569
00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:54.599
Anthony Taylor: I guess the solution. If you wanted to do

570
00:53:54.810 --> 00:54:04.269
Anthony Taylor: percentages like classification, you wouldn't do binary. You would do like a multi class at like 0 to 1011, 15,

571
00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:08.220
Anthony Taylor: 16 to 20. Whatever whatever buckets you want to make.

572
00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:10.470
Anthony Taylor: and then you would classify based on that

573
00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:12.190
Anthony Taylor: right. But

574
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:15.529
Anthony Taylor: I'm not even sure that's the best answer. But it's a good answer.

575
00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:20.769
Meredith McCanse (she/her): does it? Does it also, though it assumes that this company, like

576
00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:41.390
Meredith McCanse (she/her): what if their data is like, what if they've only ever invested in like 2 stocks in the past 5 years? Like, is there data diverse enough or solid? But that's a feature argument. That's not a target argument, and I do like that. You brought that up. But that's not. I mean, we don't know that we'll have that it's unknown.

577
00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:49.700
Anthony Taylor: So so. But it's good. I like that you brought up, because that is something you would want to look into to to ensure this is even worth doing a model for?

578
00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:55.349
Clayton Graves: Could you, could you do a target variable that

579
00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:57.100
Clayton Graves: combined

580
00:54:57.650 --> 00:55:00.300
Clayton Graves: total profit, loss and percentage?

581
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:05.420
Clayton Graves: So it it has to make percent profit and

582
00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:07.699
Clayton Graves: be a minimum of a hundred $1,000.

583
00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:09.780
Meredith McCanse (she/her): That's the same thing I did.

584
00:55:09.830 --> 00:55:16.679
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. But but to do that you'd have to do like you'd have to calculate that field in your training data. Yes, ma'am.

585
00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:17.660
Dipinto, Matt: if

586
00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:24.149
Dipinto, Matt: there's you should not like, we should not focus on the numerical value at all.

587
00:55:24.250 --> 00:55:32.180
Dipinto, Matt: Because if you invested a hundred 1 billion dollars and you made 1 million, and then you invested 50 bucks and you made 1 million.

588
00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:36.840
Dipinto, Matt: they are dramatically different things, and the percentage shows that. But the raw profit does not.

589
00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:47.229
Dipinto, Matt: But you don't think actually using both the percentage and the amount might be helpful. It could be interesting, but I think that it doesn't reflect the investment

590
00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.980
Dipinto, Matt: that went into it. If you ignore, I mean.

591
00:55:51.220 --> 00:56:05.609
Dipinto, Matt: yeah, I mean, you could make an argument that like, if you're looking at your overhead as a company, that if the raw profit is less than $3,000, it's not worth your time and then, but that's like how you make a role to say, like, you have minimum investment thresholds.

592
00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:11.659
Dipinto, Matt: but yeah, not. I guess percentage has to be a part of it. It could be fused right? But

593
00:56:12.050 --> 00:56:22.059
Anthony Taylor: that would be addressing other problems in the profit that would be changing something that we didn't offer so, but doesn't mean you can't do. And and it's good. So that again.

594
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:28.249
Anthony Taylor: point of this exercise, not necessarily to find the right answer. It's to understand

595
00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:31.339
Anthony Taylor: how to get to that right? Answer.

596
00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:40.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay. alright. I like it. One more earthquake prediction data set has earthquake records from the past 50 years.

597
00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:46.620
Anthony Taylor: The United States Geological Survey would like to use machine learning to better predict

598
00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:49.029
after shock impacts

599
00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:54.460
Anthony Taylor: after an earthquake, this one's gonna cause a mess. But okay, let's go.

600
00:56:54.830 --> 00:56:57.740
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Target column, a

601
00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:02.250
Anthony Taylor: column indicating whether there was an aftershock after each earthquake

602
00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:08.090
Anthony Taylor: BA column that with the total economic impact in dollars

603
00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:12.119
Anthony Taylor: from the aftershocks after each earthquake

604
00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:19.340
Anthony Taylor: and Ca. Column indicating the number of lives lost in aftershocks after each earthquake.

605
00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:22.429
Clayton Graves: Can you go back to the the question itself

606
00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:29.979
Anthony Taylor: like to use machine learning to better predict the after shock impacts after the earthquake.

607
00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:38.790
Anthony Taylor: What do you guys think

608
00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:45.929
Clayton Graves: I'm struggling with the morality of the question here.

609
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:50.880
Anthony Taylor: well, okay, but defining. So so tell us what you're struggling with, because

610
00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:52.839
Anthony Taylor: I think that's totally legit.

611
00:57:53.790 --> 00:58:05.280
Clayton Graves: Well, I think the number of lives lost in after shocks after each earthquake would would be just from just from a gut. Reaction would be the most important.

612
00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:10.640
Clayton Graves: But that reaction? It's not necessarily logical.

613
00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:13.160
Masarirambi, Rodney: but then because

614
00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:19.330
Masarirambi, Rodney: but that depends because the let's think of who's requesting the name as well.

615
00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:24.869
Masarirambi, Rodney: I think, whilst I don't want to sound callous.

616
00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:31.220
Masarirambi, Rodney: I don't think that's the right one, because I think think it's actually Column B,

617
00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:32.610
Masarirambi, Rodney: because

618
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:38.319
Masarirambi, Rodney: that's something that you can use to

619
00:58:38.330 --> 00:58:50.850
Masarirambi, Rodney: actually like gauge like what the impact of it that there was a dollar amount of the of the of the damage. And that's what you're gonna best gonna be able to use? The number of people can.

620
00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:55.989
Masarirambi, Rodney: I think the number of people detract from the data that you're trying to get

621
00:58:56.480 --> 00:59:08.129
Masarirambi, Rodney: for the organization that that could be very wrong, but I think it's not. I don't know enough about geology to answer this question. But it might help us eliminate choice. A.

622
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:12.870
Clayton Graves: Don't all earthquakes have aftershocks? I don't know.

623
00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:18.840
Anthony Taylor: So so let let me get you, Meredith.

624
00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:22.410
Anthony Taylor: with a okay

625
00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:27.959
Anthony Taylor:  the the whether or not it does or doesn't isn't even relevant.

626
00:59:28.330 --> 00:59:33.270
Anthony Taylor: Right? The bottom line is because there's an app shot. Is there an impact every time?

627
00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:48.790
Anthony Taylor: So that was eliminated just because of that right, that one you can eliminate simply because of the fact that not every chat, half chat has an effect. I mean, I've lived in California for over 20 years. Tell you, after shocks.

628
00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:52.799
Anthony Taylor: except in extreme cases. Most time we don't even notice.

629
00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:55.360
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Yes, ma'am.

630
00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:02.240
Meredith McCanse (she/her): What about something? Instead, that categorizes the aftershocks on like a

631
01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:32.180
Meredith McCanse (she/her): scale of like. How strong they like sort of the Richter scale of how strong they were. Because if you look at how many people that how many lives were lost that would change over time like 50 years ago, the number of people who might have lost lives would be different than now, because infrastructure was different, or the technology was different or like, and dollar amount impact, you know, is would have to be adjusted for inflation, and that like. But if it's a if, it's somehow giving you indications to the powerfulness of the aftershock, then

632
01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:40.800
Meredith McCanse (she/her): responses can be adjusted, based on what the what cities know they can handle at that point in time which is going to continually evolve.

633
01:00:41.830 --> 01:00:44.409
Anthony Taylor: But we still have to look at history to do that.

634
01:00:44.490 --> 01:00:49.129
Anthony Taylor: So what we would be looking. So so let's do that. Let's take each one of these apart. Oh, go ahead. Sorry.

635
01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:57.790
Meredith McCanse (she/her): no right. But in the history of it, saying what was so that after how strong was the after shock? Was it a 1, 2, or 3, or like a 6, 7, or 10, or something

636
01:00:58.010 --> 01:00:59.340
Meredith McCanse (she/her): is what I'm saying

637
01:00:59.830 --> 01:01:00.850
Anthony Taylor: of tent.

638
01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:03.970
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. So

639
01:01:04.350 --> 01:01:05.910
Anthony Taylor: what's the problem with this one?

640
01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:14.489
Anthony Taylor: What do you guys see as a problem with rural area that doesn't have a great deal of infrastructure.

641
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:17.760
Clayton Graves: And so the dollar amount wouldn't be very high.

642
01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:21.470
Clayton Graves: and is dollars the only thing that are impacted

643
01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:28.540
Clayton Graves: absolutely and and and no, I don't think so. I think lives the the number of lives lost or

644
01:01:28.770 --> 01:01:31.729
Clayton Graves: or injuries should be the defining factor.

645
01:01:32.550 --> 01:01:34.910
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So, looking at this one.

646
01:01:36.310 --> 01:01:41.589
Anthony Taylor: How could we use this to predict? I mean, could we use this comfortably

647
01:01:42.010 --> 01:01:44.749
Anthony Taylor: to predict a regression model

648
01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:51.740
Anthony Taylor: and see the number of lives lost after each earthquake. Yes, Christine.

649
01:01:52.790 --> 01:01:59.390
Kanouff, Christine:  I would I. What it keeps going on in my head is I don't know how you put

650
01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:05.089
Kanouff, Christine: lives, loss or economic impacts based on. You know, you can have

651
01:02:05.490 --> 01:02:08.939
Kanouff, Christine: 30 aftershocks. How can you? How can you assign

652
01:02:09.130 --> 01:02:12.159
Kanouff, Christine: each of those things to one after shock?

653
01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:15.779
Clayton Graves: It's a good question.

654
01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:17.600
Clayton Graves: It's it's legit

655
01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:20.909
michael mcpherson: they can pinpoint where they come from.

656
01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:22.760
Anthony Taylor: By that

657
01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:32.810
michael mcpherson: the Usgs can literally say, this happened at this GPS Coordinator. Well, we can assume that the aftershock, that part we can make that assumption based on

658
01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:36.950
Anthony Taylor: the classification of it is, in fact, an aftershock. But yeah, run.

659
01:02:37.690 --> 01:02:40.940
Masarirambi, Rodney: Sorry. Just tracking just for a second

660
01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:50.010
Masarirambi, Rodney: when you gave us the rules for this exercise, is anything, say that we just had to select one column, or that we could use multiple

661
01:02:51.610 --> 01:02:55.309
Anthony Taylor:  as far as for the target.

662
01:02:55.320 --> 01:03:02.759
Anthony Taylor: it can only be one. You can only predict one. You can do multi-class. You have multiple values in a single column.

663
01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:05.699
Anthony Taylor: But you wouldn't have multiple columns to be predicted.

664
01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:12.330
Anthony Taylor: We haven't covered that. Yeah, Tanya.

665
01:03:13.070 --> 01:03:28.199
Raugewitz, Tania: So I know that the intent of this is to talk about why one column is is better than the other, or the pros and cons of each, but it really goes back to making sure you define the question accurately. So you can make a

666
01:03:28.350 --> 01:03:35.149
Raugewitz, Tania: a column that can answer the question. But the question is too vague, because that impact is too general.

667
01:03:35.830 --> 01:03:41.619
Anthony Taylor: I do like that. And II would say, defining the ask is what we call this in the news?

668
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:44.760
Anthony Taylor: Right is actually very important. What is

669
01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:49.689
Anthony Taylor: right? Is it lives lost. Is it property? Is it that? But.

670
01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:55.030
Anthony Taylor: as you pointed out, also. we're actually trying to disqualify these 3 choices.

671
01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:57.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so

672
01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:03.050
Anthony Taylor: this one, I think you got actually, both of these have a similar problem.

673
01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:06.120
Anthony Taylor: Okay, in

674
01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:19.159
Anthony Taylor: San Francisco. when an 8 point oh, earthquake hits. there are many more lives lost. and there are a tremendous impact

675
01:04:19.330 --> 01:04:25.450
Anthony Taylor: in dollars. Then hell, Sacramento Fresno.

676
01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:29.320
Anthony Taylor: Okay, San Juan Capistrano.

677
01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:31.720
Anthony Taylor: Not even close

678
01:04:33.450 --> 01:04:41.179
Anthony Taylor: same 8.0. That'll kill people that it costs millions, but not billions, and not hundreds or thousands of people.

679
01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:46.720
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so it it's really, I mean, you would have to.

680
01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:49.360
Anthony Taylor: The question is, is, should you take that into account

681
01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:55.630
Anthony Taylor: because there's more lives lost because it was in a city. Doesn't that does that necessarily disqualify it?

682
01:04:56.310 --> 01:05:10.619
Anthony Taylor: Not necessarily. It's it happened in a city. So earthquake happens in a in a city we expect more lives to be lost.

683
01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:20.850
Clayton Graves: But we're only talking about aftershocks, but that does bring up a great question, the original earthquake.

684
01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:27.569
Meredith McCanse (she/her): But that's what I was saying was, if it's if it tells you the power of the after shock, like how strong, was it?

685
01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:36.390
Anthony Taylor: We're rarely stronger, but they do often, and I can tell you again. Live in California a long time. Kevin and and James live there now

686
01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:40.520
Anthony Taylor: right. What we often see is the earthquake shakes, stuff loose

687
01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:42.439
Anthony Taylor: the aftershocks, break it.

688
01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:49.770
Clayton Graves: cause your your your earthquake is, has weakened the structural integrity of the building.

689
01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:55.100
Clayton Graves: and then the aftershock aftershock causes it come tumbling down.

690
01:05:55.990 --> 01:06:06.849
Clayton Graves: I still say that the intensity of the earthquake itself, since since we it is a feature. But hear me out.

691
01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:17.350
Clayton Graves: Okay, we're we're we're talking about. We talked about a about, you know, if there were aftershocks before, and and the general consensus of the classes.

692
01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:23.180
Clayton Graves: Aftershocks follow earthquakes right? So the stronger the earthquake.

693
01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:26.410
Clayton Graves: the more likely the aftershock is to have an impact.

694
01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:37.969
Anthony Taylor: I would say, and I don't know this for sure. I haven't studied earthquakes, but living through a few of them. The bigger earthquakes often have some kind of

695
01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:40.159
Anthony Taylor: think Clayton froze, or he's

696
01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:42.460
Anthony Taylor: like that. So

697
01:06:43.610 --> 01:06:46.890
Anthony Taylor: going on. I think we lost Clayton

698
01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:53.930
Anthony Taylor: alright. Oh, he's back! You're back.

699
01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:59.029
Clayton Graves: You were frozen there for a while. Yeah, everybody else froze. I didn't catch anything. You said

700
01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:01.400
Anthony Taylor: II didn't. All I really said was

701
01:07:01.790 --> 01:07:13.759
Anthony Taylor: II agree with most of that. I mean, there's really it doesn't matter, because we only have this information and these 3 choices right now, I mean, you guys come up with other choices, but we can't add to our date.

702
01:07:14.090 --> 01:07:17.559
Anthony Taylor: We can't add to our source data. So whatever we got in our source data.

703
01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:21.490
Anthony Taylor: that's what we have to work with. And it did tell us a lot. So

704
01:07:21.690 --> 01:07:29.640
Raugewitz, Tania: who is to us, Tanya? Was that you? Yeah, I was saying I would go with B. Because and you can kind of shoot me for the assumption.

705
01:07:29.770 --> 01:07:44.819
Raugewitz, Tania: But if there's a large economic impact, then more than likely it's gonna affect people. And if there's it's gonna affect people, then there's the likelihood that they'll be desk so kind of by default they'll be included. Deaths will be included, but the reverse won't necessarily be true.

706
01:07:44.850 --> 01:07:46.829
Raugewitz, Tania: If you just go by def.

707
01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:52.440
Anthony Taylor: II think I think you guys actually, and I think, Tanya, you're probably one that said this.

708
01:07:52.450 --> 01:07:59.369
Anthony Taylor: I would say, go back to the person that asked the question. say, you need to give us some way to measure impact.

709
01:07:59.670 --> 01:08:00.600
Anthony Taylor: What is that?

710
01:08:00.850 --> 01:08:03.840
Anthony Taylor: What the heck is that is that insurance dollars

711
01:08:04.090 --> 01:08:08.479
Anthony Taylor: is that government dollars. Is that combination of both?

712
01:08:09.790 --> 01:08:19.349
Anthony Taylor: Is it property damage? Is it lives lost? What is it? Right? And and we don't know? No, no, and we don't have enough information to really know based on this. But

713
01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:25.449
Anthony Taylor: given the exercise, these were the choices we were given my opinion. None of these are very good.

714
01:08:25.529 --> 01:08:32.259
Anthony Taylor: And that's okay. It's okay. Cause that was what we were trying to do. Why are each one of these not the best choice?

715
01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:36.020
Anthony Taylor: We don't even have to come up with the best choice, because we don't have enough information.

716
01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:39.739
Anthony Taylor: Alright. But we wanted to come up with a short term.

717
01:08:40.170 --> 01:08:40.870
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

718
01:08:41.350 --> 01:08:45.809
Anthony Taylor: alright, that was fun. I like, I like those kind. See? I wish we did more of those.

719
01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:48.499
Anthony Taylor: I love the whole class conversation thing

720
01:08:49.090 --> 01:08:50.590
Anthony Taylor: alright. Hi!

721
01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.330
Anthony Taylor: So

722
01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:56.529
Anthony Taylor: moving forward metrics.

723
01:08:57.859 --> 01:09:12.590
Anthony Taylor: So now we're going to start getting into all of the different ways. We can measure the the the quality of our model notice. I didn't say accuracy. I didn't say precision.

724
01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:16.580
Anthony Taylor: Okay, all of those things are actually different measures.

725
01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:20.420
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna get into all of alright.

726
01:09:20.779 --> 01:09:32.550
Anthony Taylor: So first off, let's just make couple definitions, imbalance data. We looked at some a minute ago with the one, you know, 4,500, those and a thousand guests. That's inbound

727
01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:41.300
Anthony Taylor: what we would prefer is to have as many as of each class, or close to the same number of each class. That's just it.

728
01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:44.469
Anthony Taylor: Does it always happen? Rarely does that happen.

729
01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.180
Anthony Taylor: But it's nice when it does

730
01:09:46.580 --> 01:10:00.120
Anthony Taylor: class in this usage in this context classification. So whatever your your target variable is okay. So the what we're looking for is that

731
01:10:00.150 --> 01:10:06.129
Anthony Taylor: whatever we're trying to classify, the label we're trying to classify is evenly distributed. Very rare.

732
01:10:06.150 --> 01:10:10.260
Anthony Taylor: Does that actually happen? Okay, very, very rare.

733
01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:13.779
Anthony Taylor:  So yeah, there's that

734
01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:28.909
Anthony Taylor: accuracy. Now, this is the thing that we've been using a lot of. But this is where you're gonna see why. though it's pretty good, it's not great. and that is that it measures the correct predictions

735
01:10:29.130 --> 01:10:33.089
Anthony Taylor: against the total. So if I have yes, I'm

736
01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:38.590
Baro, Sonja: I'm sorry to make you go back to imbalance. But the

737
01:10:39.230 --> 01:10:52.540
Baro, Sonja: so the answer you gave I wanna make sure I understand. So imbalance data would be if in my target. I have more of way, more of one value than another.

738
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:59.199
Baro, Sonja: Is that what that unbalanced amount? So yes, let's say you have 10 times as many yeses, as you do note.

739
01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:03.050
Baro, Sonja: or even in our prediction like.

740
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:07.830
Baro, Sonja: So if our target column is our prediction.

741
01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:19.909
Baro, Sonja: if we have 75% of one prediction versus 25% of the other. That's that's not good, that's considered imbalanced.

742
01:11:20.370 --> 01:11:25.999
Anthony Taylor: Well, here's what happens. And and III hear you. But let me tell you guys what ends up happening?

743
01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:29.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay, let's say, we have 75%

744
01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:30.440
Anthony Taylor: is blue.

745
01:11:30.930 --> 01:11:35.540
Anthony Taylor: All right, that's what we're gonna do. Blue and red. Okay, 25% are red.

746
01:11:35.670 --> 01:11:41.359
Anthony Taylor: So when we train our model, it's going to find more blue, is the answer than red

747
01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:44.200
Anthony Taylor: alright, and it becomes

748
01:11:45.690 --> 01:11:56.170
Anthony Taylor: less even as it goes through. So the real headache, I mean the model will will suffer because of that. But let me tell you where it really falls apart

749
01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:06.099
Anthony Taylor: is when you start calculating the accuracy. So let's just say I steer. Let's just say it got every single blue right.

750
01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:10.849
Anthony Taylor: In fact, let's just say it said everything was blue.

751
01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:15.550
Anthony Taylor: All, every rope was blue.

752
01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.949
Anthony Taylor: That means our accuracy score is going to be what

753
01:12:21.290 --> 01:12:22.830
Anthony Taylor: 75%,

754
01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:34.370
Anthony Taylor: because it got 75% of the data correct. That's not a terrible model yet. It couldn't guess, Red, if you slapped it in the face and said, Dang it, it's red.

755
01:12:35.770 --> 01:12:44.599
Anthony Taylor: It still wouldn't know it was read. It would never be able to figure that out. So imbalance causes a problem for us in scoring as well as in training.

756
01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:50.400
Anthony Taylor: And like, I said, there are exercises to fix and balance data. Yes, Derek.

757
01:12:53.150 --> 01:12:58.710
Derek Rikke: okay. Well, now, I'm just trying to process what you just said. But Mike is

758
01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:01.650
Derek Rikke: the problem that like.

759
01:13:01.730 --> 01:13:06.299
Derek Rikke: if it's 75, 25 for the outcomes.

760
01:13:06.970 --> 01:13:16.699
Derek Rikke: that it's gonna like, build that into the model where it's like expecting 75% to be blue. 25% to be read just like, generally, or is it

761
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:20.969
Derek Rikke: cause it's like the weights are more weighted toward blue

762
01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:23.140
Derek Rikke: than red. And that's

763
01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:36.499
Anthony Taylor: it's more the scoring that we concern ourselves with. But yeah, if most of the stuff is one value, it will. It will tend to find that value, is the correct answer. More often than not it will lean towards that.

764
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:43.509
Anthony Taylor: Oh, go ahead. So zoom balance data like that, essentially creating a bias.

765
01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:46.689
Anthony Taylor: Yes, a hundred percent.

766
01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:52.529
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it doesn't mean we can't get round it. But it is something we have to be aware of when you score it

767
01:13:52.610 --> 01:13:54.429
Anthony Taylor: so with accuracy.

768
01:13:54.610 --> 01:14:05.080
Anthony Taylor: The the best way to describe accuracy is, it is the score of how many times I'm right. but it takes does not take into account how many times it's wrong.

769
01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:12.890
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So my, my example in here, if 99% of your email is not spam

770
01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:17.630
Anthony Taylor: alright, your model is gonna be 99% back.

771
01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:22.879
Anthony Taylor: But that means that it's never gonna guess. Spam.

772
01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:33.170
Anthony Taylor: it is not going to get spam right when it comes in, because it's never seen it. It's only seen a few records of spam. It's no idea unless it comes in exactly the same.

773
01:14:33.650 --> 01:14:42.319
Clayton Graves: At that point you've got a model that's guessing heads for each point. Toss, no matter what.

774
01:14:42.580 --> 01:14:51.869
Clayton Graves: Because, yeah, cause the first coin tosses were, we're all heads for whatever reason. Right?

775
01:14:52.320 --> 01:15:11.509
Anthony Taylor: So here's II didn't. I didn't realize that. So within balance data model can achieve high accuracy by only predicting majority class accuracy, accuracy doesn't explain the errors, false positives. False, negative. We're gonna get into that in a second and it does not take into account certainty of model in the calculation. Okay.

776
01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:19.600
Anthony Taylor: Hi. this leads us to this really cool thing called the confusion matrix.

777
01:15:19.970 --> 01:15:22.749
Anthony Taylor: Sonia likes this. It's confusing.

778
01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:27.500
Anthony Taylor: No, it's not okay. So

779
01:15:27.870 --> 01:15:33.809
Anthony Taylor: think of. We have all of our predictions. And all of the correct answers.

780
01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:35.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

781
01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:40.969
Anthony Taylor: so we have answers that we predicted were positive.

782
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:47.760
Anthony Taylor: And the actual answer was also positive. This is a true positive.

783
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:50.840
Anthony Taylor: Right here

784
01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:57.480
Anthony Taylor: we have answers that were negative. and we predicted negative.

785
01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:59.280
Anthony Taylor: That's a true negative.

786
01:15:59.490 --> 01:16:02.360
Anthony Taylor: So those are the answers. We got right.

787
01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:04.950
Anthony Taylor: Everybody understand it

788
01:16:06.330 --> 01:16:11.720
Anthony Taylor: false negative. We said it was negative. but it was actually positive.

789
01:16:13.290 --> 01:16:19.930
Anthony Taylor: We got it wrong. false, positive. We said it was positive. but it was actually negative.

790
01:16:21.170 --> 01:16:25.509
Anthony Taylor: With this confusion matrix, we can generate nearly every

791
01:16:26.770 --> 01:16:28.559
Anthony Taylor: metric we want.

792
01:16:29.770 --> 01:16:34.139
Anthony Taylor: And there's like 4 of them calculated from these 4

793
01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:35.390
Anthony Taylor: ratios.

794
01:16:37.410 --> 01:16:38.240
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

795
01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:46.810
Anthony Taylor: so let's look at what they are. First, one accuracy. Remember what accuracy. It's just what we got right?

796
01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:51.220
Anthony Taylor: So true, positive, true, negative. That's all we care.

797
01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:54.570
Anthony Taylor: What's the percentage of the entire set.

798
01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:58.969
Anthony Taylor: You know of truths of truth that we got.

799
01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:05.830
Anthony Taylor: So it's just what we got right. It does not take into account what we missed

800
01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:08.670
Anthony Taylor: sensitivity

801
01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:11.469
Anthony Taylor: exactly the opposite.

802
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:13.749
Anthony Taylor: Wait, hold up

803
01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:22.259
Anthony Taylor: so! Oh, sorry, not the opposite.

804
01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:27.289
Anthony Taylor: The sensitivity is how many times we got the positive

805
01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:28.480
Anthony Taylor: right.

806
01:17:30.170 --> 01:17:35.750
Anthony Taylor: So if you see this. It says, true, positive over false negative. What are false negatives in the data?

807
01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:39.800
Anthony Taylor: There are positives that we said were wrong.

808
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.050
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

809
01:17:42.150 --> 01:17:51.630
Anthony Taylor: And then the true positives. So this is all positives, and this is what we guessed is positive that gives us the sensitivity. Sensitivity

810
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:55.130
Anthony Taylor: these days is usually referred to as recall

811
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:57.910
Anthony Taylor: alright.

812
01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:04.669
Anthony Taylor: This is important measurement when it's vital that your your output

813
01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:06.060
Anthony Taylor: is

814
01:18:06.450 --> 01:18:09.110
Anthony Taylor: positive when it needs to be positive.

815
01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:12.769
Anthony Taylor: So what would be an what, what might be an example of that

816
01:18:20.970 --> 01:18:22.820
Anthony Taylor: anybody. Nobody.

817
01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:31.709
Dipinto, Matt: You say the question one more time.

818
01:18:32.490 --> 01:18:34.339
Anthony Taylor: What would be an example

819
01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:40.060
Anthony Taylor: of too many are, are what would be an example of a model where

820
01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:46.549
Anthony Taylor: true word positives true positive ratio is best, where retal is more important than accuracy.

821
01:18:49.730 --> 01:18:52.339
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Maybe something where it's outing.

822
01:18:55.170 --> 01:18:57.969
Anthony Taylor: Did I hear, count, what sign here?

823
01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:01.710
Baro, Sonja: I said. Certain illnesses people wanna have

824
01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:12.600
Baro, Sonja: accurate. Let be very sensitive. because to tell somebody that they were sick when they're not really, especially with certain diagnoses. would be bad.

825
01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:16.399
Clayton Graves: Wouldn't accuracy be more important in that context?

826
01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:30.480
Anthony Taylor: Well, accuracy just says we get. But that's like not taking into account negatives at all, while recall is taking into account whether it's it's basically important when we want to avoid false negatives.

827
01:19:31.090 --> 01:19:32.279
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so

828
01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:40.769
Anthony Taylor: some examples, this would be like models that could identify fraudulent credit card chart. Okay, we don't want. I mean.

829
01:19:40.890 --> 01:19:51.929
Anthony Taylor: if it stops a charge and then phones you, is it the end of the world. No, but if that happened every damn time you did a credit card charge, you'd lose your freaking mind

830
01:19:53.050 --> 01:20:00.390
Anthony Taylor: right? So trust me, they don't want a lot of false negatives when they do that. So they're going to use. Recall as an important metric.

831
01:20:00.570 --> 01:20:06.200
Anthony Taylor: Poisonous mushrooms. Do we want to miss this one. Very often

832
01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:12.739
Anthony Taylor: we take a picture we got me. Oh, that one's not poisonous.

833
01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:15.729
Anthony Taylor: Turns out it is

834
01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:32.880
Anthony Taylor: okay patients with cancer. Now, I will tell you the medical ones in this case. I don't, Sonya. I agree with you. But anyone that's using a machinery model to definitively, definitively, you know, diagnose. Something is an idiot.

835
01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:37.690
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Nobody does all we use these models for, in fact.

836
01:20:37.810 --> 01:20:43.170
Anthony Taylor: I would be inclined to be okay with false positive.

837
01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:53.080
Anthony Taylor: Why? Because that means they're more likely to go get tested. Further testing to confirm the false possible.

838
01:20:53.270 --> 01:21:04.949
Anthony Taylor: So in more cases than not, I would rather guess a little too often that it's positive when it comes to cancer diabetes any chronic, any illness period.

839
01:21:05.370 --> 01:21:16.709
Baro, Sonja: So Anthony is better just for testing. That's like that's a real life example. Because when I worked at the Diabetes Association, the test that we used

840
01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:18.720
Baro, Sonja: intentionally

841
01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:21.360
Baro, Sonja: tries to over predict.

842
01:21:21.450 --> 01:21:27.869
Baro, Sonja: So because there's no real harm. Right?

843
01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:30.030
Baro, Sonja: Yeah, I love that.

844
01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:35.410
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so our next measure is specific.

845
01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:40.420
Anthony Taylor: You guys hear that just making sure my mic was messing up

846
01:21:40.690 --> 01:21:44.109
Anthony Taylor: alright. So using specific as main units

847
01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:51.639
Anthony Taylor: specificity, that sophisticity as the main measurement find out how many of the actual false

848
01:21:52.070 --> 01:22:01.109
Anthony Taylor: data points. Okay, so now, we're looking at the true negatives. Okay? And again.

849
01:22:01.370 --> 01:22:03.270
Anthony Taylor: this is where we

850
01:22:03.330 --> 01:22:08.559
Anthony Taylor: where false positives are not what we want. So we want this score to be high

851
01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:14.670
Anthony Taylor: when we want to avoid false positives. Okay?

852
01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:21.280
Anthony Taylor: yeah. So that's you know

853
01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:28.369
Anthony Taylor: I'm trying. I'm trying to think of a good example of this, and I'm not. I don't like the one they give

854
01:22:31.950 --> 01:22:44.729
Anthony Taylor: like recall focusing too much on specificity can cause you to miss out on key positives. So one thing that I want you to be aware of is, both of these are are very focused on true, positive, or true negative.

855
01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:48.209
Anthony Taylor: That alone is rarely a good measure.

856
01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:53.619
Anthony Taylor: But understanding. I went too far, understanding that that's what these 2 give us

857
01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:56.060
Anthony Taylor: is important. Now.

858
01:22:56.410 --> 01:23:03.459
Anthony Taylor: what I have heard in the past is like, well, our accuracy is this, and then you'll have a data scientist. Go. Yeah. But what's your recall?

859
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:11.459
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Because that gives you a better picture. When you combine these metrics

860
01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:28.799
Anthony Taylor: alright precision. How many times the true, the true results were actually true. Now this is a little different than accuracy. because, remember, accuracy, said true negatives and true positives.

861
01:23:29.610 --> 01:23:40.670
Anthony Taylor: divided by the whole thing. Precision is just the true positives divided by all of the possible. So it's a different

862
01:23:40.690 --> 01:23:42.210
Anthony Taylor: measure.

863
01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:43.490
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

864
01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:48.990
Anthony Taylor: And this one.

865
01:23:50.170 --> 01:23:58.430
Anthony Taylor: So precision would be preferred. Metric including. If you're designing a model to identify blank bank clients who are at credit risk.

866
01:23:58.730 --> 01:24:02.119
Anthony Taylor: or who identify as a high risk for violent crime.

867
01:24:02.410 --> 01:24:11.049
Anthony Taylor: positively identifying a particular person or area could negatively impact the future. Where someone who is wrongly denied alone

868
01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:19.279
Anthony Taylor: can be over can become over policed alright. So we want to get it right. We're less worried about getting it wrong.

869
01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:22.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay, precision is a good one.

870
01:24:24.330 --> 01:24:25.160
Anthony Taylor: Now.

871
01:24:25.490 --> 01:24:31.779
Anthony Taylor: what we're gonna do in code in a few moments is create a classification report.

872
01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:34.249
Anthony Taylor: It's as simple as this guys.

873
01:24:35.010 --> 01:24:39.019
Anthony Taylor: You do your prediction. So you model dot predict to a variable.

874
01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:44.899
Anthony Taylor: You compare the test to your predictions, using the classification report method.

875
01:24:45.130 --> 01:24:49.240
Anthony Taylor: You will get precision. Recall F. One, and accuracy.

876
01:24:49.450 --> 01:24:54.630
Anthony Taylor: But, Anthony, what the heck is F one. One is actually the youthful one.

877
01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:58.079
Anthony Taylor: Okay. F, one balances

878
01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:01.579
Anthony Taylor: sensitivity and precision.

879
01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:09.640
Anthony Taylor: All right, giving us what is probably the better measure. But once you guys do look

880
01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:11.410
Anthony Taylor: at this

881
01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:24.640
Anthony Taylor: assume F, one score is a very good score to use. Okay, closer to one is better. Is this a good model.

882
01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:28.489
Anthony Taylor: Look at the accuracy. The accuracy is pretty good.

883
01:25:31.250 --> 01:25:34.490
Anthony Taylor: What do you guys see in that? F one score that looks funky.

884
01:25:38.450 --> 01:25:44.900
Meredith McCanse (she/her): What did how do you read this with the what does the line, the row that says one, and the row that says 0 mean?

885
01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:50.419
Anthony Taylor: So this is, you know. That's a good question. I didn't make that clear. Do this is what we're predicting.

886
01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:55.389
Anthony Taylor: This is the target. So it's either predicting. It's one or 0.

887
01:25:56.210 --> 01:25:57.759
michael mcpherson: It's more than a hundred percent.

888
01:25:57.860 --> 01:26:01.880
Clayton Graves: I think you'd want your one score to be closer to

889
01:26:01.970 --> 01:26:03.650
Anthony Taylor: it doesn't read across.

890
01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:05.200
Clayton Graves: I think he's very early.

891
01:26:05.650 --> 01:26:16.120
Clayton Graves: I think you want your F. One support to be more like 50 50 I mean optimally, as opposed to 94, 26. That just means it's skewed

892
01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:18.699
Clayton Graves: drastically in the direction of 0.

893
01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:24.169
Anthony Taylor: You, you would want to be 100 100 and ideal. We want both to be close to 100.

894
01:26:24.210 --> 01:26:26.159
Dipinto, Matt: So let me throw this out there.

895
01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:32.710
Anthony Taylor: Alright. No, I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. I just wanna I wonder. III realize just saying, what do you see? Is weird wasn't enough.

896
01:26:32.930 --> 01:26:37.070
Anthony Taylor: These are your targets. This is your precision score for each type.

897
01:26:37.190 --> 01:26:51.260
Anthony Taylor: This is your recall for each target. This is your F one score for each target. This is how many rows of each target we have.

898
01:26:54.460 --> 01:27:05.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay, accuracy is measured against the whole set. So this is our total data rows. Macro app. These are precision. Recall F, one weighted average.

899
01:27:06.370 --> 01:27:10.050
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So what we mostly look at is this.

900
01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:12.450
Clayton Graves: if you want 100

901
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:15.120
Anthony Taylor: close to what

902
01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:21.199
Clayton Graves: in that case it's it's bad. And then you look at the support data.

903
01:27:21.290 --> 01:27:24.170
Clayton Graves: and and that just reinforces. You've got

904
01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:29.400
Clayton Graves: 14, 6, 32, one answer, and only 2,000 of another

905
01:27:31.210 --> 01:27:39.789
Anthony Taylor: so severely imbalanced. And so this is the great. So basically what we are saying when we look at this, our model is great, at negative.

906
01:27:41.130 --> 01:27:42.520
Anthony Taylor: terrible.

907
01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:43.840
possible.

908
01:27:45.550 --> 01:27:55.950
Anthony Taylor: And when we look at the accuracy score, this becomes really obvious. Now that accuracy is not doing a good job of taking into account in balance data

909
01:27:56.130 --> 01:27:59.009
Anthony Taylor: looks like a good model, 89% accuracy.

910
01:27:59.370 --> 01:28:02.920
Anthony Taylor: But the truth be known, it's really bad.

911
01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:11.080
Anthony Taylor: Unless, of course, you're passing in data that you want to be negative or 0.

912
01:28:12.130 --> 01:28:14.640
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we're gonna learn how to code that

913
01:28:15.010 --> 01:28:16.720
Anthony Taylor: a

914
01:28:17.150 --> 01:28:25.730
Anthony Taylor: there is a balanced accuracy which we also will have a method for that is supposed to take in the accuracy of each class.

915
01:28:26.190 --> 01:28:29.720
Anthony Taylor: So if you consider this and this.

916
01:28:29.790 --> 01:28:40.520
Anthony Taylor: this will give you effectively the balanced okay, which is better than is more accurate than this one for sure. Okay?

917
01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:50.580
Anthony Taylor: Balance weights. The accuracy of all classes evenly. Good metric for imbalanced data set simple to calculate

918
01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:58.279
Anthony Taylor: does not take into account the certainty of the model does not explain whether errors are from false positives or false negative

919
01:28:59.350 --> 01:29:08.329
Anthony Taylor:  So in this case, you can see, we predicted. Yes, for everything.

920
01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:14.460
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So all predictions have. The accuracy is 70,

921
01:29:14.630 --> 01:29:21.680
Anthony Taylor: the balanced accuracy average, and the accuracy of positive and negative classes. So this is that example with the blue, red I gave you earlier

922
01:29:22.030 --> 01:29:30.579
Anthony Taylor: everything with 75, 70%. In this case of your data was blue, and all the model said is, everything is blue.

923
01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:33.659
Anthony Taylor: It would be 70%.

924
01:29:34.100 --> 01:29:36.409
Anthony Taylor: But 30% of them would be wrong.

925
01:29:37.190 --> 01:29:43.260
Anthony Taylor: So true, yeses 100%. That's correct. True, no's 0% got nothing right?

926
01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:45.200
Anthony Taylor: Because it said all the reds were blue.

927
01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:53.309
Anthony Taylor: Okay, accuracy, 70 balanced accuracy, 50%. Which is right? Well, sort.

928
01:29:54.110 --> 01:29:57.309
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But it's clearly showing that the model's not that great.

929
01:29:58.580 --> 01:29:59.470
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

930
01:29:59.970 --> 01:30:04.289
Anthony Taylor: are we gonna do this right now? Oh, yeah.

931
01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:08.100
Anthony Taylor: alright. So the receiver operating characteristics curve.

932
01:30:09.580 --> 01:30:11.360
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna show you a picture of it in a second.

933
01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:20.930
Anthony Taylor: But it basically visualizes true positives and false positive rates of predictions using a range of decision thresholds.

934
01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:22.090
Anthony Taylor: We'll get into that.

935
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:31.150
Anthony Taylor: The area under the curve A UC. Dash. Roc, is the area under the the curve. You're going to see.

936
01:30:31.690 --> 01:30:33.520
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we are going to get to one in a second.

937
01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:38.179
Anthony Taylor: Model outputs desk. Oh.

938
01:30:38.230 --> 01:30:44.869
Anthony Taylor: I don't know why. I guess this makes sense. So the decision threshold. Remember, guys, when I told you with logistic regression.

939
01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:47.180
Anthony Taylor: that sigmoid curve.

940
01:30:47.450 --> 01:30:52.180
Anthony Taylor: And they're and right now we're gonna say, point 5 0. That's the threshold.

941
01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:57.450
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But remember. And I also said that it's not actually 0. And one.

942
01:30:57.700 --> 01:30:59.090
Anthony Taylor: it's actually

943
01:30:59.130 --> 01:31:02.510
Anthony Taylor:  like a decimal.

944
01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:06.710
Anthony Taylor: And anything above point 5 0 is going to be one, anything below is going to be 0.

945
01:31:07.780 --> 01:31:09.700
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So

946
01:31:10.010 --> 01:31:11.739
Anthony Taylor: that's what this is about to talk

947
01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:15.439
Anthony Taylor: this, you can actually see

948
01:31:15.590 --> 01:31:17.499
Anthony Taylor: that decimal output.

949
01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:23.949
Anthony Taylor: not just 0 1, and you can change the decision threshold.

950
01:31:24.260 --> 01:31:25.280
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

951
01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:28.420
Anthony Taylor: so this is an roc shirt.

952
01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:37.399
Anthony Taylor: So the true positive versus the false positive, and it goes up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up the area, under the curve. Is this blue area here?

953
01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:44.959
Anthony Taylor: Alright. when you visualize this, what do you imagine a near perfect model would look like.

954
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:51.689
Anthony Taylor: I don't have a picture of one. So you're gonna have to tell

955
01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:00.190
Anthony Taylor: anybody want to take a guess.

956
01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:05.360
Baro, Sonja: So 50 50 if you're trying for balance

957
01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:09.789
Anthony Taylor: it, it basically, it would be this, this corner right here

958
01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:11.200
Anthony Taylor: would be right here.

959
01:32:12.650 --> 01:32:18.420
Anthony Taylor: It basically would go like straight up and then straight across. That would be perfect.

960
01:32:19.140 --> 01:32:24.890
Anthony Taylor: Okay, the rounder. This is the less value the less your model is good.

961
01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:29.199
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Now this can change with the threshold

962
01:32:30.090 --> 01:32:36.780
Anthony Taylor: right? Based on where you put the threshold to become a one. This this will change.

963
01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:40.910
Anthony Taylor: Does that make sense? Because, see, we're only measuring 0 and one.

964
01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:45.759
Anthony Taylor: So if we move the threshold up, this goes closer to here.

965
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:50.950
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Or we move it up on this side closer to here.

966
01:32:52.540 --> 01:33:04.840
Anthony Taylor: Alright? Yeah. So that's how that works. We're gonna make one of those. It's pretty cool. Gauges the certainty of the model in its predictions. It measures the degree of separatability.

967
01:33:05.170 --> 01:33:10.649
Anthony Taylor: and how effective the model is at distinguishing classes that has to do with that threshold.

968
01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:14.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and you can penalize it

969
01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:25.300
Anthony Taylor: for messing up by changing that threshold. it can still be skewed by a balance and doesn't differentiate between the different types of errors. Okay.

970
01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:32.990
Anthony Taylor: so comparing accuracy only for balance balance. Okay for imbalance otherwise

971
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:37.189
Anthony Taylor: similar to accuracy. Count auk rock

972
01:33:37.460 --> 01:33:43.469
Anthony Taylor: A to C. Roc. Accounts for the certainty of the model gives more information than accuracy.

973
01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:48.490
Anthony Taylor: but is difficult to calculate and will still struggle with imbalanced data.

974
01:33:48.870 --> 01:33:57.019
Anthony Taylor: So sometimes we just need more input. alright. Okay. So now let's go look at something.

975
01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:05.120
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

976
01:34:07.370 --> 01:34:18.149
Anthony Taylor: So here we've got some sk learn metrics, we're gonna add. and we're going to add a confusion basics classification report, balance act report and rock Oxford

977
01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:24.420
Anthony Taylor: Rock up. I don't think anyone says it that way but me. I think I just made it up

978
01:34:24.730 --> 01:34:36.149
Anthony Taylor: anyway. So here's some imbalance data that we know is in balance. We're gonna and you can see it right here. It's basically the data we showed in the slide.

979
01:34:36.810 --> 01:34:37.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

980
01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:44.660
Anthony Taylor:  we're gonna do that we've done this data before. This is that android, if it's malware or not.

981
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:52.959
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to get rid of the result. We're going to do a logistic regression. We're going to score it. Our accuracy is 89.

982
01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:54.710
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

983
01:34:55.150 --> 01:35:06.510
Anthony Taylor: okay? Now, we need to do our predictions on X, and then we're going to create a confusion matrix with our Y values and our predictions.

984
01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:10.989
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this labels. This is just telling it what

985
01:35:11.100 --> 01:35:14.450
Anthony Taylor: the name which usually like. If this was like.

986
01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:16.860
Anthony Taylor: true, false or

987
01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:21.660
Anthony Taylor: good, bad. You could put the labels here, and it would show up

988
01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:26.389
Anthony Taylor: it would. It would just show up in the classification report.

989
01:35:26.650 --> 01:35:28.860
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So here you can see

990
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:31.460
Anthony Taylor: the way that we were reading it in the slideshow.

991
01:35:36.130 --> 01:35:38.180
Anthony Taylor: I want to find the one with the labels.

992
01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:47.019
Anthony Taylor: True, positive, true, negative, false, negative, false. I'm so glad. They finally fixed that for ages the slide was backwards was true, positive.

993
01:35:47.230 --> 01:35:51.639
Anthony Taylor: true, negative. It was just. It drove me crazy. So true positives are down here.

994
01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:53.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

995
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:57.130
Anthony Taylor: true negatives are up here. So these are the ones we got right.

996
01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:58.560
Anthony Taylor: These are the ones we got wrong.

997
01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:02.210
Anthony Taylor: alright positive on the right negative on the left.

998
01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:11.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay, here's our classification report. Here's where the labels are actually important. The labels, whatever you put in labels are going to show up right here.

999
01:36:12.770 --> 01:36:16.950
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so this is the same classification report we were looking at in the slide.

1000
01:36:17.010 --> 01:36:18.449
Anthony Taylor: But this is how we made it.

1001
01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:31.230
Anthony Taylor: It's literally this simple guys. You do the predict. Put it in a variable. Compare your Y to your predict. You could also do test variable or test data. If you did train test split on this.

1002
01:36:31.870 --> 01:36:40.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But it's they're both valid. The trained data and the test data will give you a good classification report.

1003
01:36:40.370 --> 01:36:44.470
Anthony Taylor: Just remember, training data is what you trained it on. It might be better.

1004
01:36:44.890 --> 01:36:52.260
Anthony Taylor: could be worse. But you're testing data. It's never seen before. So if it does good on that. you're probably on the right track.

1005
01:36:53.470 --> 01:36:59.910
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So here we can do balance accuracy score, which is all calculated in one pass

1006
01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:03.020
Anthony Taylor: 57.6. That's it pretty close to that.

1007
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:06.290
Anthony Taylor: So you could probably just use macroe evidence. And you'd be okay.

1008
01:37:06.850 --> 01:37:10.930
Anthony Taylor: This is the thing that I was telling you.

1009
01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:14.360
Anthony Taylor: So what this is doing is for each

1010
01:37:15.260 --> 01:37:16.390
Anthony Taylor: prediction.

1011
01:37:16.530 --> 01:37:19.240
Anthony Taylor: It's showing us what the actual

1012
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:21.549
Anthony Taylor: probabilities are.

1013
01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:33.050
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So on the left is the first variable on the right is second, so 0 1. So this is saying, there's an 89% chance.

1014
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:39.209
Anthony Taylor: This is a one or a 0. Sorry. Okay, actually, almost all except this one.

1015
01:37:39.230 --> 01:37:48.260
Anthony Taylor: So this one's interesting says there's a 38% chance. It's a 0, but a 62. So if the threshold is 0 point 5. This is a one.

1016
01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:54.090
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if the threshold was point 7,

1017
01:37:54.570 --> 01:37:55.969
Anthony Taylor: this is still a 0.

1018
01:37:58.590 --> 01:37:59.380
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

1019
01:38:00.230 --> 01:38:12.400
Anthony Taylor: Oh, here we go. So what are we doing here? Both 0. One class really need predictions for the one class. Use a list comprehension to gather the second value from each list.

1020
01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:16.170
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Print the first 5 probabilities.

1021
01:38:17.290 --> 01:38:18.530
Anthony Taylor: Alrighty.

1022
01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:21.380
Anthony Taylor: Not sure why it's doing that.

1023
01:38:24.970 --> 01:38:33.709
Anthony Taylor: Oh, it's only showing the the value on the left. So it's only showing the probability that it is a 0. But since these are for ones.

1024
01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:37.140
Anthony Taylor: we're seeing that the 0 value is really

1025
01:38:37.770 --> 01:38:43.880
Anthony Taylor: okay, this is the probability that it's a 0. But we asked for only the ones that were a one. Okay.

1026
01:38:44.430 --> 01:38:46.010
Anthony Taylor: alright so.

1027
01:38:46.060 --> 01:38:53.460
Anthony Taylor: And then here's our Roc, a, you see, score 71. This is the area under the curve that that score.

1028
01:38:53.470 --> 01:38:55.400
Anthony Taylor: So again.

1029
01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:59.770
Anthony Taylor: this looks way better than what it really is. So

1030
01:39:00.150 --> 01:39:04.080
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to tell you guys from experience. I spend more time

1031
01:39:04.290 --> 01:39:06.959
Anthony Taylor: looking at the F. One than most any of this

1032
01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:16.939
Anthony Taylor: alright, because when I can get these 2 scores to a reasonable amount. Then all the rest of these fall in place.

1033
01:39:18.450 --> 01:39:19.480
Anthony Taylor: They just do

1034
01:39:21.110 --> 01:39:25.069
Anthony Taylor: alright. Alright! How we doing! We're going

1035
01:39:25.260 --> 01:39:28.840
Anthony Taylor: a little long. So what we'll do is when you guys come back

1036
01:39:28.850 --> 01:39:31.440
Anthony Taylor: will do this activity

1037
01:39:31.630 --> 01:39:36.580
Anthony Taylor: alright. So go ahead and take your breaks. I'll see you at 25 after

1038
01:39:42.070 --> 01:39:44.489
Anthony Taylor: alright welcome back for break. We got a quick

1039
01:39:44.650 --> 01:39:53.030
Anthony Taylor: activity. Basically, you're gonna do what we just did in the metrics. So you're going to bring in

1040
01:39:54.010 --> 01:39:59.780
Anthony Taylor:  what? What?

1041
01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:02.900
Anthony Taylor: Sorry Matt's chat

1042
01:40:02.910 --> 01:40:04.220
Anthony Taylor: distracted me.

1043
01:40:07.570 --> 01:40:10.419
Anthony Taylor: I don't know what he's talking about. Okay,

1044
01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:16.649
Anthony Taylor: anyway. So you're gonna read in the data you're going to

1045
01:40:17.310 --> 01:40:22.489
Anthony Taylor: go ahead and get your value counts, do a logistic regression finish, predict it?

1046
01:40:22.870 --> 01:40:33.990
Anthony Taylor: And then basically, you're gonna end up making transportation report and looking at the different scores as well as the probability. Good news is exactly

1047
01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:39.499
Anthony Taylor: like the demo I just did for you. So 15 min should be sufficient.

1048
01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:40.890
Anthony Taylor: Hi, again.

1049
01:40:41.170 --> 01:40:43.769
Anthony Taylor: have fun. Call us if you need us

1050
01:41:02.900 --> 01:41:08.010
Anthony Taylor: welcome back everybody. How job you did! You have enough time?

1051
01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:10.960
Anthony Taylor: Think you did?

1052
01:41:31.860 --> 01:41:36.840
Anthony Taylor: That's alright. It's the good news, is. It's so similar to the instructor one

1053
01:41:37.340 --> 01:41:42.109
Anthony Taylor: not too worried. But let's spread through it.

1054
01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:50.380
Anthony Taylor: So, as we pointed out, we have some new imports with metrics. We're going to import the ones that we're going to use in the activity

1055
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:53.680
Anthony Taylor: after we create a thing

1056
01:41:55.720 --> 01:42:07.569
Anthony Taylor: connecting. And then after that, we'll import our data. We're going to take a look at the outcome column. We've used this data before. This is our.

1057
01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:12.819
Anthony Taylor: There's not much to it. And we can see this is pretty in balance.

1058
01:42:13.390 --> 01:42:20.790
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So we're going to drop outcomes. So create our Xy data. We're doing a logistic regression.

1059
01:42:21.310 --> 01:42:25.600
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we can see our score came out to 87, which

1060
01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:31.130
Anthony Taylor: doesn't look too bad. Okay. so we do our predictions

1061
01:42:31.180 --> 01:42:43.750
Anthony Taylor: and print our confusion matrix. We can already see, just looking at this, that there's there's a good chance. There's a problem. Alright. Now, how? Why do I say that? Well, look at our our falses.

1062
01:42:44.660 --> 01:42:49.510
Anthony Taylor: Alright, that's a whole lot. We only have 700 rows of data.

1063
01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:51.210
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1064
01:42:51.680 --> 01:43:00.949
Anthony Taylor: so we can print our classification report. And we can see that we're really good at identifying when it's one

1065
01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:03.930
Anthony Taylor: so good of identifying when it's 0.

1066
01:43:04.730 --> 01:43:12.450
Clayton Graves: Pretty much could flip the coin and do better. Well, the reason we're really good at identifying the one is because it's more one than 0.

1067
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:15.530
Anthony Taylor: Yes.

1068
01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:24.170
Anthony Taylor: and yes, I'll just stay with yes, for right. we'll talk about that more as we talk about ways to handle this later on.

1069
01:43:24.410 --> 01:43:27.750
Anthony Taylor:  And then we have

1070
01:43:27.870 --> 01:43:36.350
Anthony Taylor: basically our balance, which we're going to calculate. But we can see it's going to be close to that 70 to 66%.

1071
01:43:36.860 --> 01:43:42.270
Anthony Taylor: But we can tell us it's not a great model. So our F one scores tell us we got a problem.

1072
01:43:42.310 --> 01:43:48.389
Anthony Taylor: Our balanced accuracy gives us a better idea of what our model is performing at.

1073
01:43:48.690 --> 01:43:51.020
Anthony Taylor: Now for the predict probas.

1074
01:43:51.370 --> 01:43:58.990
Anthony Taylor: This is just going to show us the actual probabilities between 0 and one. So the first one is the 0

1075
01:43:59.180 --> 01:44:00.840
Anthony Taylor: second one is one.

1076
01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:07.580
Anthony Taylor: So we can see these are all really low probabilities of being 0. They all came out once.

1077
01:44:07.670 --> 01:44:21.369
Clayton Graves: how do we know? How do we know which column is? It's in order of the of the variables. So 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Yeah, okay, so 0 is on the left.

1078
01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:23.090
Clayton Graves: Okay?

1079
01:44:23.540 --> 01:44:27.129
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, now, if these were categorical variables.

1080
01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:30.820
Clayton Graves: it always starts with the lowest number

1081
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:43.829
Anthony Taylor: effectively, yes, okay. But it's like, say, we use label encoder on this, on, on like, say, 5 variables. Right? It would be 0 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and you would they have to actually

1082
01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:47.349
Anthony Taylor: ask it which one they are depending on, how the labeling

1083
01:44:48.710 --> 01:44:49.620
Anthony Taylor: okay.

1084
01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:53.520
Anthony Taylor: cause. It's not nice and gives you the nice, pretty answer to that.

1085
01:44:54.090 --> 01:44:58.859
Anthony Taylor: So here we're gonna just look at at the.

1086
01:44:59.630 --> 01:45:06.009
Anthony Taylor: We only need predictions for the one class. We're going to use a list comprehension to gather it. So this was just like in

1087
01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:08.900
Anthony Taylor: the demo. And you can see these were all ones

1088
01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:12.350
which makes sense, since most of the data was.

1089
01:45:13.210 --> 01:45:16.320
Anthony Taylor: And last, but not least, let's look at our rock out

1090
01:45:17.890 --> 01:45:20.370
Anthony Taylor: 86. So

1091
01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:26.029
Anthony Taylor: that didn't do very well. Why? Because, remember, it doesn't do as well with imbalanced data.

1092
01:45:26.930 --> 01:45:31.219
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so our best metric in this case, one

1093
01:45:32.460 --> 01:45:33.500
Clayton Graves: F one

1094
01:45:34.670 --> 01:45:36.299
Anthony Taylor: have one and

1095
01:45:36.970 --> 01:45:40.099
Raugewitz, Tania: a the balance accuracy.

1096
01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:42.149
Anthony Taylor: the balanced activities.

1097
01:45:42.310 --> 01:45:54.730
Raugewitz, Tania: So just a question, Anthony at for the Ocrock store score or rock. Oc, you said 86%. Wasn't that great? But

1098
01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:59.919
Anthony Taylor: well, no, it's not that great compared. Okay, rock. Doc is great.

1099
01:46:00.790 --> 01:46:20.209
Anthony Taylor: but we know it's not great cause we know that. Yeah. So I'm sorry the rock up wasn't a great indicator. That's how I should stated that, thank you is that to get a true picture of your model, you need to use multiple classification or multiple reports

1100
01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:22.079
Clayton Graves: to get the whole picture

1101
01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:37.269
Anthony Taylor: the multiple scores, are you one? If if they all line up or are close to each other, you're gonna do better. And I will tell you that this isn't just because it's in balance does not mean it will always look like this.

1102
01:46:37.300 --> 01:46:43.540
Anthony Taylor: It is possible, if you have enough features right, that it can still predict both of these. Well.

1103
01:46:44.380 --> 01:46:47.130
Anthony Taylor: okay, we have what? Who?

1104
01:46:48.050 --> 01:46:52.229
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Yeah. So there's no way it could have been

1105
01:46:52.670 --> 01:46:53.969
Anthony Taylor: good with just 2.

1106
01:46:54.770 --> 01:46:56.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So, Meredith, what's up?

1107
01:46:57.250 --> 01:47:07.669
Meredith McCanse (she/her): We we did train test split on our data, and our numbers were much higher in terms of this, like scores and stuff.

1108
01:47:08.450 --> 01:47:14.030
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Is that because when you do train test, split, it trains your models for it.

1109
01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:18.429
Anthony Taylor: It's training on less data.

1110
01:47:18.970 --> 01:47:24.349
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So did you guys look at like your your value counts and stuff on your training data.

1111
01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:36.300
Anthony Taylor: So if you were, gonna do that, and and I have problem with that, I think that's a great idea right? But if you're gonna do that, you would want to do like the value counts before and the value counts after.

1112
01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:41.229
Anthony Taylor: So that you can see because what you really want to look at at that point is.

1113
01:47:41.550 --> 01:47:44.860
Anthony Taylor: does this ratio still apply to your brain test date?

1114
01:47:46.050 --> 01:47:53.450
Anthony Taylor: Right? So if you did the training. Let's say you did the training data. And this drops, you know, to 300. And this

1115
01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:56.510
Anthony Taylor: for because it's random, is still at a hundred.

1116
01:47:58.490 --> 01:48:05.939
Anthony Taylor: Right now you have 300. 100. It's not as far. It's not as in balance, but your testing date is, gonna be terrible.

1117
01:48:06.220 --> 01:48:09.430
Anthony Taylor: Those are gonna have like 260 to 11.

1118
01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:18.880
Anthony Taylor: Alright! But here's the beauty of it. You're you're less in balance. So your training was better. Your testing is almost all

1119
01:48:18.970 --> 01:48:23.650
Anthony Taylor: ones. And so therefore, your testing's gonna look spectacular.

1120
01:48:24.830 --> 01:48:28.139
Meredith McCanse (she/her): right? Because it's really good at detecting once.

1121
01:48:28.150 --> 01:48:35.549
Anthony Taylor: So if your testing is 260 ones and 10 zeros. Then it's gonna get at least

1122
01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:39.270
Anthony Taylor: 260 out of 271, right?

1123
01:48:41.450 --> 01:48:56.860
Anthony Taylor: So you wanna make sure that the ratio of your different outcomes is retained after you do train more or less. Yeah, the good news is, there's again, there are mechanisms that we will get to that will allow you to do.

1124
01:48:57.060 --> 01:49:08.480
Anthony Taylor: And this is also in how we handle that balance data where you would do multiple train test splits and train the data across it multiple ways, thus giving it

1125
01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:11.209
Anthony Taylor: a different view of the data each time.

1126
01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:21.790
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And that is part, we're gonna get to that later. I don't want to jump too far again. so we will get to that. But that was a wonderful observation there to think. Yes, I

1127
01:49:22.820 --> 01:49:27.180
Baro, Sonja: so, continuing half of the train test split

1128
01:49:27.370 --> 01:49:28.830
Baro, Sonja: discussion.

1129
01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:43.889
Baro, Sonja: Wouldn't there be concern if you have in balance data that you you don't know where your your data got distributed into. So my question there was, would you would you recommend using the K fold

1130
01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:48.310
Baro, Sonja: to make sure you split it within somewhat

1131
01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:50.409
Baro, Sonja: some way to have it.

1132
01:49:50.780 --> 01:49:55.430
Baro, Sonja: that that's similar to how we're gonna handle imbalance data later.

1133
01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:56.630
Baro, Sonja: Okay.

1134
01:49:56.750 --> 01:49:57.690
Anthony Taylor: a.

1135
01:49:58.470 --> 01:50:05.440
Anthony Taylor: there's there are definitely ways to handle this. Okay, we're we're just not there yet. We're going to get there.

1136
01:50:05.540 --> 01:50:10.439
Anthony Taylor: But I love it. But you guys are asking exactly the question that you need to be asking.

1137
01:50:10.580 --> 01:50:17.329
Anthony Taylor: Alright, you know one. Why are your train tests split? 2. How can we make train tests, split

1138
01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:20.780
Anthony Taylor: work consistently to maintain the ratio

1139
01:50:20.890 --> 01:50:24.220
Anthony Taylor: of the data, and we are going to get there, I promise.

1140
01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:27.139
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But we're gonna do it in this like

1141
01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:32.100
Anthony Taylor: cool, automated way. So we don't want. I don't want to jump too far ahead on that

1142
01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:33.410
Anthony Taylor: Hi.

1143
01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:35.640
Anthony Taylor: and that's pretty much it on this one.

1144
01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:37.489
Anthony Taylor: Any other questions on this

1145
01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:41.319
Anthony Taylor: excellent good work?

1146
01:50:41.830 --> 01:50:56.689
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So now we're gonna talk a little bit more about overfitting. It seems like we see this. this slide so often. Well, first. overfitting sufficiently complex model will always shape itself to the training data.

1147
01:50:57.060 --> 01:51:01.090
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's what we want to see. Alright.

1148
01:51:01.950 --> 01:51:11.380
Anthony Taylor: the some relationship to the training data will help model make predictions on new data. Well, of course. other relationships are meaningless. Simply add noise tomorrow. That's really cute.

1149
01:51:11.420 --> 01:51:16.899
Anthony Taylor: Underfitting is the opposite of all of this. The model just doesn't fit

1150
01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:20.099
Anthony Taylor: well at all. It doesn't shape to the data.

1151
01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:35.210
Anthony Taylor: It's just kind of going through the middle of it, and it won't learn any meaningful relationships, not enough to be of any value. But we've seen this visual before overfitted. The model's trying too hard to match every single point.

1152
01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:42.930
Anthony Taylor: Okay, under fit. It's just the lab not even close. Might get a couple. Okay.

1153
01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:48.639
Anthony Taylor: and then a good fit. The line more or less, goes through the middle of the day.

1154
01:51:49.980 --> 01:51:50.880
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

1155
01:51:51.090 --> 01:51:54.010
Anthony Taylor:  that was weird.

1156
01:51:54.610 --> 01:52:00.130
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So the idea is, define the middle point between over fit and under fit.

1157
01:52:00.290 --> 01:52:04.190
Anthony Taylor: It's actually pretty easy to force either one.

1158
01:52:05.070 --> 01:52:14.589
Anthony Taylor: especially when we start getting into the more advanced models in a couple of weeks. Right? It's actually really easy to overfit like the tensorflow model.

1159
01:52:15.210 --> 01:52:27.700
Anthony Taylor: Okay, tensorflow is incredible. And it can do it. Given enough time, it can almost overfit anything. And and there's ways we stop that. Okay.

1160
01:52:28.810 --> 01:52:32.030
Anthony Taylor: alright. So let's look at it. A demo.

1161
01:52:35.950 --> 01:52:44.589
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So here we're going to bring in random forests. Random Forest is also very good at overfitting. We have a bunch of data here that's beautiful. It's beautiful thing.

1162
01:52:44.740 --> 01:52:52.620
Anthony Taylor: right? We're gonna deal with the result. So we're going to drop the result for X, and we're going to put it into Y,

1163
01:52:52.870 --> 01:52:55.409
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna do a train test split this time.

1164
01:52:56.510 --> 01:53:06.059
Anthony Taylor: We're going to initialize our model with a random state of 13. We're going to do a fit on our training data and then score our testing data.

1165
01:53:07.250 --> 01:53:10.349
Anthony Taylor: 96, 9, 97, not bad.

1166
01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:16.520
Anthony Taylor: Okay. let's do a score on our training data

1167
01:53:17.770 --> 01:53:21.109
Anthony Taylor: 98, 2. This looks good liking this model.

1168
01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:32.099
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So here's what we're going to do. We're going to. This is, gonna look a whole lot like the elbow. You guys remember the the K-means elbow

1169
01:53:32.270 --> 01:53:33.989
Anthony Taylor: or, yeah, Kami's

1170
01:53:34.410 --> 01:53:40.370
Anthony Taylor: told you guys, I get K means K, and N all the time mixed up alright. So we're going to go.

1171
01:53:41.460 --> 01:53:43.459
Anthony Taylor: How do I explain this?

1172
01:53:44.140 --> 01:53:50.470
Anthony Taylor: there is a term called hyper parameters. Now, you guys, remember when I showed you documentation of the model.

1173
01:53:50.890 --> 01:53:59.710
Anthony Taylor: and there were all of those variables that you could change. And I said, This is how we tune the model. When I do this I'm tuning like a little screwdriver to

1174
01:54:00.330 --> 01:54:04.160
Anthony Taylor: the model tune them up. Okay,

1175
01:54:04.410 --> 01:54:13.800
Anthony Taylor: we're going to change a variable called depth. Alright. Actually, what depth is that? What we used here? No, we use random state.

1176
01:54:13.950 --> 01:54:16.549
Anthony Taylor: So Max. Depth

1177
01:54:16.810 --> 01:54:32.080
Anthony Taylor: is a variable, a hyper parameter of Random forest. Now I'm going to tell you later. And and and Brandon put this up a chat the other day. We're going to do a way to cycle through a whole bunch of different parameters

1178
01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:36.040
Anthony Taylor: today. We're just going to look at one alright.

1179
01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:43.360
Anthony Taylor: So in this case, we're we're gonna look one through 40, we're gonna do steps of 2. So 1, 3, 5, etc.

1180
01:54:43.780 --> 01:54:50.400
Anthony Taylor: We're going to for each item in this depth array.

1181
01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:56.289
Anthony Taylor: We're going to get a train score, a test score and the depth value that we use.

1182
01:54:56.430 --> 01:55:00.050
Anthony Taylor: We're going to run Random Forest. We're going to train it.

1183
01:55:00.420 --> 01:55:07.900
Anthony Taylor: Then we're going to score it for both train and test and then put it into these lists.

1184
01:55:08.540 --> 01:55:15.680
Anthony Taylor: Then we're going to create a data frame from it. Where depth is the index and show what it looks like.

1185
01:55:16.110 --> 01:55:18.130
Anthony Taylor: This is going to take a few seconds.

1186
01:55:25.470 --> 01:55:36.609
Anthony Taylor: So where we're heading, and I'll show you what what is eventually going to come up is we're going to create a plot like this. Now, this looks like an Roc curve. Right? It's not

1187
01:55:36.990 --> 01:55:42.549
Anthony Taylor: okay. This is showing that our accuracy

1188
01:55:42.750 --> 01:55:45.959
Anthony Taylor: is getting better as our depth

1189
01:55:47.150 --> 01:55:59.470
Anthony Taylor: gets deeper up to a point. What we want to look at is okay. Well, this looks good. This looks good. This looks good. Okay, about sure. We see, they start separate

1190
01:56:01.060 --> 01:56:09.139
Anthony Taylor: once our train and our tests start separating. That means that something is going wrong or we've just gone too far.

1191
01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:16.779
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Like, I told you, higher training, lower testing means we've over fit our data.

1192
01:56:16.830 --> 01:56:26.039
Anthony Taylor: So the reality is up. There we go. So we've now finished its sundance thing. But, boom! We're going to plot it. It looks like this.

1193
01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:28.330
Anthony Taylor: Sorry.

1194
01:56:33.340 --> 01:56:39.499
Anthony Taylor: So the Max depth that we really want here is probably right in here. So round 7.

1195
01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:44.879
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so this is probably the best

1196
01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:53.819
Anthony Taylor: hyper parameter to train our model before it starts to overfit. Now, you might be like, well, wait

1197
01:56:53.970 --> 01:56:56.669
Anthony Taylor: isn't 7 based on this, like.

1198
01:56:57.310 --> 01:57:00.549
Anthony Taylor: you know, 95%. But up here

1199
01:57:00.590 --> 01:57:05.650
Anthony Taylor: we were getting 97, and 98. The answer is, yes.

1200
01:57:06.220 --> 01:57:19.199
Anthony Taylor: just because what we're saying here is anything beyond 7. We're going to start to overfit, and our model will lose its its ability to properly generalize.

1201
01:57:19.510 --> 01:57:24.469
Anthony Taylor: So this goes back to what we talked about earlier. I read the whole book I memorized.

1202
01:57:25.230 --> 01:57:30.890
Anthony Taylor: Okay, versus, I read summaries. And I know, basically, what's in every chapter.

1203
01:57:33.100 --> 01:57:35.050
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So

1204
01:57:35.230 --> 01:57:37.579
Anthony Taylor: at 7, we've read the summons.

1205
01:57:37.890 --> 01:57:41.250
Anthony Taylor: once we get past 7, we started memorizing the text.

1206
01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:45.090
Anthony Taylor: okay, make sense.

1207
01:57:46.730 --> 01:57:49.230
Anthony Taylor: I see lots of nods. Mostly.

1208
01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:52.510
Anthony Taylor: okay, all right, I'm gonna go with that.

1209
01:57:52.880 --> 01:57:56.519
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so basically, you guys have another activity. And it's

1210
01:57:56.840 --> 01:57:59.400
Anthony Taylor: pretty much the same as what we just did.

1211
01:57:59.500 --> 01:58:02.019
Anthony Taylor: You're gonna pull in some data

1212
01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:05.890
Anthony Taylor: you're going to train, test split. You're going to fit it to Random Forest.

1213
01:58:06.140 --> 01:58:09.820
Anthony Taylor: calculate the accuracy, and then do that same loop.

1214
01:58:10.130 --> 01:58:12.369
Anthony Taylor: Remember, copy and paste is your friend.

1215
01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:19.760
Anthony Taylor: and you'll end up with a model with look at that one. That one is like, super obvious.

1216
01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:22.760
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But

1217
01:58:22.980 --> 01:58:26.360
Anthony Taylor: this is what you're trying to see. Okay.

1218
01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:29.709
Anthony Taylor: hiking same 15 min for this one

1219
01:58:30.820 --> 01:58:38.780
Baro, Sonja: found with some of the parameters, because the question I had Anthony was. that's great.

1220
01:58:38.830 --> 01:58:47.970
Baro, Sonja: So I see where it's it's diverging. What are the things that I tweet to then go and keep them in parallel longer.

1221
01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:57.440
Anthony Taylor: There's literally a line in my in my lesson plan right now. It says, emphasize that any hyper parameter could be used.

1222
01:58:59.990 --> 01:59:07.340
Anthony Taylor: not just Max depth and checking every combination of our parameter would become infinitely large task.

1223
01:59:07.790 --> 01:59:11.860
Anthony Taylor: This method is best reserved for tuning specific parameters, but

1224
01:59:11.900 --> 01:59:16.650
Anthony Taylor: we'll explore how to tune hyper parameters more broadly in day. Freeze lesson.

1225
01:59:18.700 --> 01:59:21.740
Anthony Taylor: So good job you're ahead of the game.

1226
01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:23.880
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1227
01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.960
Anthony Taylor: so over 50.

1228
01:59:27.790 --> 01:59:29.499
Anthony Taylor: I got everything up all right.

1229
01:59:30.570 --> 01:59:32.919
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna bring in this one.

1230
01:59:32.950 --> 01:59:43.059
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna get rid of outcome and bring in outcome. Same test, split random forest classifier. Nothing new. Score 95 that.

1231
01:59:43.690 --> 01:59:52.470
Anthony Taylor: Okay, let's do it on our training data. One up. Oh. that could be a red flag. Not necessarily could be.

1232
01:59:52.710 --> 01:59:55.969
James Torres: So we're gonna create depth range one to 15.

1233
01:59:56.090 --> 02:00:01.709
Anthony Taylor: We're going to create the little loop that we did in the previous exercise and see what we come up with.

1234
02:00:02.950 --> 02:00:06.290
Anthony Taylor: That came up fast and then plot it out.

1235
02:00:06.600 --> 02:00:12.100
Anthony Taylor: Wow! That's really bad. Is that really what it came up with?

1236
02:00:12.350 --> 02:00:19.899
Clayton Graves: Yeah, nothing like what ours can. Yeah, what seed did you guys use on your current test? Split

1237
02:00:21.450 --> 02:00:22.870
Raugewitz, Tania: 13 and one?

1238
02:00:24.090 --> 02:00:24.900
Raugewitz, Tania: Oh.

1239
02:00:25.330 --> 02:00:26.980
Raugewitz, Tania: yeah, I understand.

1240
02:00:29.010 --> 02:00:31.540
Anthony Taylor: I'm not sure why they didn't add that in

1241
02:00:32.860 --> 02:00:39.490
Clayton Graves: you didn't. You didn't specify your step. You just did one to 15. But you didn't

1242
02:00:39.780 --> 02:00:44.420
Anthony Taylor: that I mean that that's okay in this case. But but you know we can do that, too.

1243
02:00:45.090 --> 02:00:47.880
Anthony Taylor: Oh, no, actually, it's just steps with one in this. So

1244
02:00:48.430 --> 02:00:59.600
Anthony Taylor: it is what? But anyway, this looks better. Right? Okay, right? So again, what you're looking at is where they start to diverge, which is pretty early in this case.

1245
02:00:59.870 --> 02:01:00.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1246
02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:08.429
Anthony Taylor: and then that's what you want to use. So you want train is normally going to be higher.

1247
02:01:08.650 --> 02:01:14.030
Anthony Taylor: then test. But what you want to watch is when train starts to leave test behind.

1248
02:01:14.490 --> 02:01:23.610
Anthony Taylor: and that is an indicator that we are starting to over fit. Does that mean you're over fit? Not necessarily. It means you are starting

1249
02:01:23.890 --> 02:01:28.060
Anthony Taylor: to overfit when it gets up here, you definitely overfit.

1250
02:01:28.810 --> 02:01:34.360
Clayton Graves: Now around the around the 3 range, they they they start to get close together again

1251
02:01:34.970 --> 02:01:44.319
Anthony Taylor: a little bit right here. So that's where we decided to put our foot down, and and we said 3 totally fair. Yes, Gabe

1252
02:01:46.510 --> 02:01:52.210
Vasquez, Gabriel: for when I would just click the run, all button.

1253
02:01:52.330 --> 02:02:06.580
Vasquez, Gabriel: and I wouldn't change any of like the the Random States, or anything. You would come back with. The plot would come back differently. It would be way more drastic than you know what you have right now, or would be, you know, tame.

1254
02:02:06.990 --> 02:02:08.430
Anthony Taylor: See? Like that one? Yeah.

1255
02:02:08.810 --> 02:02:13.910
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So somewhere in here we've got some kind of random something going on

1256
02:02:14.340 --> 02:02:19.220
Anthony Taylor: that is causing it to

1257
02:02:20.460 --> 02:02:22.680
Anthony Taylor: do a different state.

1258
02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:26.820
Anthony Taylor: So yeah, I mean that it. It is most likely

1259
02:02:27.110 --> 02:02:32.610
Anthony Taylor: because we don't have anything in there. Wait. Did we even put yeah, we did there?

1260
02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:44.989
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, this has to do with random state. There's no question. But yeah, it's still basically in the same area that we need to start concerning ourselves.

1261
02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:50.239
Anthony Taylor: So it's still working. It's just not as not always as clear.

1262
02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:53.380
Anthony Taylor: Is that fair? Gabe?

1263
02:02:54.150 --> 02:02:56.579
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, see, there's the third run.

1264
02:02:58.690 --> 02:03:02.670
Anthony Taylor: the fourth ride. It's almost always around the same spot.

1265
02:03:02.980 --> 02:03:07.829
Anthony Taylor: So we're okay. I'm okay with it being slightly different as long as it's usually the same answer.

1266
02:03:08.450 --> 02:03:09.520
Vasquez, Gabriel: okay.

1267
02:03:10.070 --> 02:03:17.299
Anthony Taylor: alright. So not gonna have time to give you guys, this is an activity. So we will jump right in and make this. And everyone do.

1268
02:03:17.980 --> 02:03:20.929
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Because it's a whole lot of copy and paste and

1269
02:03:21.140 --> 02:03:27.060
Anthony Taylor: no reason to kill ourselves with that. Actually, you know what? We'll simply review it. I did want to point out.

1270
02:03:27.070 --> 02:03:30.510
Anthony Taylor: Brendan is correct. That's

1271
02:03:31.570 --> 02:03:40.149
Anthony Taylor: this cell, or one of these cells will fail as you're running through it. It's the one right below where you're at

1272
02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:42.789
Anthony Taylor: right? So the solution

1273
02:03:42.870 --> 02:03:47.290
Anthony Taylor: is, when you do get dummies you have to do d type equals int

1274
02:03:48.310 --> 02:03:49.500
a

1275
02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:51.679
Anthony Taylor: do that. Here

1276
02:03:53.040 --> 02:03:57.279
Meredith McCanse (she/her): are we, des does ex activity 8, not have an exercise.

1277
02:03:57.610 --> 02:04:07.040
Anthony Taylor: They actually know it's another like everyone talk about it. But we're just not gonna time to do that one today. So when you do the get dummies on, why, you need to add this to the end.

1278
02:04:08.310 --> 02:04:10.670
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And that solves the problem.

1279
02:04:10.870 --> 02:04:14.509
Anthony Taylor: But let's go through this solution.

1280
02:04:14.540 --> 02:04:17.460
Anthony Taylor: Okay. which you guys don't have.

1281
02:04:22.620 --> 02:04:26.380
Anthony Taylor: Well, we'll go through it. You guys can do this one on your own.

1282
02:04:26.420 --> 02:04:29.229
Anthony Taylor: I was just gonna say, alright, guys, we're out of time.

1283
02:04:29.930 --> 02:04:33.849
Anthony Taylor: Go do this, and we'll go over it on Wednesday.

1284
02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:39.999
Anthony Taylor: Actually, I'll give you the option. Do you want to do that? Or do you want me to go through it right now and then? You guys can do it on your own.

1285
02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:49.499
Anthony Taylor: Let's do it right now. Yeah, okay, so do you want me to go through it first, though. Right now.

1286
02:04:49.910 --> 02:05:05.289
Anthony Taylor: yeah, okay, alright, alright. Okay. It's not guys, it's really just the summation of everything we've done today. So not anything new. we're gonna import the data again. They're doing the drop in a which not great. But whatever

1287
02:05:05.370 --> 02:05:08.680
Anthony Taylor: okay? We went from.

1288
02:05:10.350 --> 02:05:11.420
Anthony Taylor: let's do

1289
02:05:13.060 --> 02:05:15.960
Anthony Taylor: that. So we have 33,000 brooks

1290
02:05:16.160 --> 02:05:21.620
Anthony Taylor: down to 5,000. Nice. So there's a bit of a problem

1291
02:05:21.830 --> 02:05:27.710
Anthony Taylor: we're going to. We're going to basically encode our Y variable

1292
02:05:27.730 --> 02:05:36.149
Anthony Taylor: into ones and zeros. Just so, you know, if you don't do dtype int. They recently changed this, and it will give you true and false.

1293
02:05:37.300 --> 02:05:44.859
Anthony Taylor: which isn't a problem except right here, we're gonna say, only give us variables that are numbers.

1294
02:05:44.900 --> 02:05:52.200
Anthony Taylor: We need that Y variable. true and false, is not a number. though it doesn't show up

1295
02:05:52.630 --> 02:05:54.979
Anthony Taylor: unless you make it d type equals it.

1296
02:05:55.660 --> 02:05:58.970
Clayton Graves: And then Boolean.

1297
02:05:59.210 --> 02:06:03.080
Clayton Graves: you probably could. But

1298
02:06:03.250 --> 02:06:08.169
Anthony Taylor: when they broke this. get dummies, did ones and zeros not true false.

1299
02:06:08.830 --> 02:06:13.829
Anthony Taylor: So it took me a minute to figure that out today when I was going through everything.

1300
02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.230
Anthony Taylor: But so I just wanna make sure you guys got it.

1301
02:06:16.340 --> 02:06:21.299
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So here, we're gonna set up our X and y do our train test split

1302
02:06:21.670 --> 02:06:28.640
Anthony Taylor: beautiful. We're gonna do ensemble random Forest and fit it. It's a beautiful thing.

1303
02:06:28.770 --> 02:06:36.319
Anthony Taylor: and we're going to do a predict and look at our balanced accuracy score which we have learned today is pretty good.

1304
02:06:36.980 --> 02:06:37.870
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

1305
02:06:38.050 --> 02:06:46.439
Anthony Taylor: But let's also wait. Oh, so that was on the test data. Let's look at it for our training data.

1306
02:06:46.720 --> 02:06:47.710
Anthony Taylor: Whoa.

1307
02:06:49.690 --> 02:06:53.680
Anthony Taylor: that's really high, considering we had a 70 year.

1308
02:06:54.000 --> 02:07:09.059
Anthony Taylor: So we almost for sure have a problem. So we're gonna do the same loop that we did in the last exercise. We're gonna loop through this. We're gonna look at Max Depth. This is just the variable we chose for this example. Okay, we could have chose any variable.

1309
02:07:09.310 --> 02:07:12.769
Anthony Taylor: and it probably would have gave us the same result.

1310
02:07:12.790 --> 02:07:17.740
Anthony Taylor: not necessarily the same numeric result like this one is, gonna be

1311
02:07:18.740 --> 02:07:22.250
Anthony Taylor: very clearly a 3. Okay.

1312
02:07:22.370 --> 02:07:28.650
Anthony Taylor: if you would have done a different IP parameter it could have been, I mean, it'd be like point 0 1

1313
02:07:28.690 --> 02:07:31.120
Anthony Taylor: or something. You have no idea it depends on the parameter.

1314
02:07:31.350 --> 02:07:34.969
Anthony Taylor: So now oh, they're gonna go with 5, whatever

1315
02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:39.590
Anthony Taylor: and let's see how that looks pretty good.

1316
02:07:39.630 --> 02:07:47.360
Anthony Taylor: I mean, I would have said 3. But it's not gonna it's not really gonna be a better score. It's just gonna be more accurate tech.

1317
02:07:47.740 --> 02:07:52.969
Anthony Taylor: right? Which when you consider. look up here 70 and one.

1318
02:07:53.870 --> 02:07:59.660
Anthony Taylor: Well, that's awesome. right? But we ended up with 51.

1319
02:07:59.850 --> 02:08:05.320
Anthony Taylor: That's terrible. Why? Because look at how quick this thing overfitted, just shut up

1320
02:08:07.240 --> 02:08:10.290
Anthony Taylor: alright. So our model was able was

1321
02:08:10.320 --> 02:08:18.770
Anthony Taylor: really overfitting fact. And that's why our score is really low. Is this, make this a bad model? Well, it's not great.

1322
02:08:18.900 --> 02:08:25.210
Anthony Taylor: but at least we know our model was scored properly, and we didn't mistakenly

1323
02:08:25.410 --> 02:08:29.509
Anthony Taylor: try to pass it off as a 70%, 80% accurate model.

1324
02:08:30.710 --> 02:08:31.860
Anthony Taylor: Understand?

1325
02:08:31.970 --> 02:08:34.520
Anthony Taylor: That's why this is important.

1326
02:08:35.700 --> 02:08:42.949
Anthony Taylor: Yes, we shot our model that looked great down to nothing. But now, at least, we know we have a good model to work.

1327
02:08:43.070 --> 02:08:49.519
Clayton Graves: Be an interesting exercise to go back to some of these old models that we've done over the last few weeks that are high scores.

1328
02:08:49.650 --> 02:08:51.490
Clayton Graves: Look at what they are.

1329
02:08:51.870 --> 02:09:00.370
Anthony Taylor: Mostly we're gonna I mean, they they use like the same examples over and over again for the most part. So I will tell you. Many of them are not.

1330
02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:11.249
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna have to get better date. A lot of the data that we use is so that the models train quickly. Right? Cause you guys don't want to wait while we all stare at the screen right?

1331
02:09:11.460 --> 02:09:16.870
Anthony Taylor:  so. But don't worry. We'll get bigger models as time goes on.

1332
02:09:17.670 --> 02:09:19.370
Anthony Taylor: We will, I promise.

1333
02:09:19.810 --> 02:09:25.819
Anthony Taylor: Anyway, I do recommend. I mean, I would say, why, you guys are studying. Try to do that activity

1334
02:09:25.960 --> 02:09:32.930
Anthony Taylor: yourself. It's the same activity as the last one, basically. So I don't know that you're getting a lot out of it. More practice.

1335
02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:41.040
Anthony Taylor: Next class gonna be more email optimization. We're going to be focusing on data leakage.

1336
02:09:41.660 --> 02:09:44.070
Anthony Taylor: This is this is this could be ugly

1337
02:09:44.290 --> 02:09:47.019
Anthony Taylor:  and how to spot it.

1338
02:09:47.100 --> 02:09:49.500
Anthony Taylor: dealing with missing values.

1339
02:09:51.450 --> 02:09:55.830
Anthony Taylor: choosing encodings and feature engineering.

1340
02:09:56.470 --> 02:10:00.209
Anthony Taylor: Very exciting stuff. guys, this is actually

1341
02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:03.690
Anthony Taylor: this is problem. In my opinion, this is

1342
02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:10.709
Anthony Taylor: one of my favorite module weeks so far. because you're really gonna learn something valuable.

1343
02:10:11.670 --> 02:10:18.250
Anthony Taylor: Okay, not that everything hasn't been valued. But this is the kind of stuff that's going to differentiate you

1344
02:10:18.410 --> 02:10:23.219
Anthony Taylor: from the data analyst that's been trying to learn machine learning from udemy.

1345
02:10:24.690 --> 02:10:27.460
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this is what's gonna make the difference.

1346
02:10:28.500 --> 02:10:32.360
Anthony Taylor: II have a wonderful Tuesday.

1347
02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:35.590
Anthony Taylor: I oh, 60'clock Wednesday.

1348
02:10:36.110 --> 02:10:40.650
Anthony Taylor: hosting a website on azure. Have your azure accounts signed up

1349
02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:42.260
Anthony Taylor: before coming.

1350
02:10:43.620 --> 02:10:50.269
Anthony Taylor: Okay. It only takes a minute. You do need some kind of credit card, but you will get a $200 credit.

1351
02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:53.840
Anthony Taylor: It won't cost you a penny. Okay?

1352
02:10:54.030 --> 02:11:02.859
Anthony Taylor: And then you can cancel it if you want to. In fact, I don't even think I think what azure does, which is probably good is they won't ever charge you.

1353
02:11:03.140 --> 02:11:06.050
Anthony Taylor: But what happens is is, when your credit is gone.

1354
02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:10.349
Anthony Taylor: they'll stop letting you access. They'll say, Look, you gotta let us know you want.

1355
02:11:10.480 --> 02:11:12.360
Anthony Taylor: You know you're okay with us charging.

1356
02:11:12.910 --> 02:11:15.140
Anthony Taylor: Alright, I guys.

1357
02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:22.370
Anthony Taylor: I work in this stuff every day on my personal accounts, and I would freak out if I got a bill over 10 bucks.

1358
02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:28.869
Anthony Taylor: So it's it's never happened. Well, that's not true. One time I got one for 550,

1359
02:11:31.240 --> 02:11:35.609
Anthony Taylor: but I created. I bought some hardware, and I created an IoT

1360
02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:39.230
Anthony Taylor: thing. If anybody knows what IoT is that's actually really cool.

1361
02:11:39.270 --> 02:11:45.449
Anthony Taylor: And I did a demo for a consulting company, and it was amazing. And then I forgot to turn it off

1362
02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:47.649
Anthony Taylor: for a month.

1363
02:11:49.050 --> 02:11:53.489
Anthony Taylor: $500. Okay, the good news is called him up, said, Hey.

1364
02:11:54.160 --> 02:11:55.709
Anthony Taylor: I would stop.

1365
02:11:56.160 --> 02:11:57.489
Anthony Taylor: and they went. Oh.

1366
02:11:58.220 --> 02:12:00.220
Anthony Taylor: and they just erased. So it was a

1367
02:12:01.390 --> 02:12:04.500
Anthony Taylor: anyway. Have a great Tuesday. I was new

1368
02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:06.720
Anthony Taylor: on Wednesday. We'll be here for 30.

1369
02:12:07.710 --> 02:12:09.330
Masarirambi, Rodney: Just a little.

1370
02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:12.740
Anthony Taylor: whatever.

1371
02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:14.500
Anthony Taylor: Thanks, Anthony.
