1
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:17.970
Anthony Taylor: How

2
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.750
Anthony Taylor: today's a big day.

3
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.369
Anthony Taylor:  has done so many things.

4
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.330
You know, we have some visualizations which we're gonna use a little bit of that today.

5
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.439
Anthony Taylor: We've done charting, which is awesome. We've done

6
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.220
Anthony Taylor: some pandas manipulation. We're gonna bring all that stuff together. So going forward

7
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.619
time out

8
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.610
Anthony Taylor: that it's curry again.

9
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.750
It's cool.

10
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.829
Anthony Taylor: Oh, I see, you're just you have one just sitting there. I got it

11
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.450
Anthony Taylor: alright. So

12
00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.470
Anthony Taylor: starting today. Now, next week is projects. Okay.

13
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:09.289
Anthony Taylor: But starting today, officially, we're going to start really digging into machine learning. So keep in mind a, I is apparent

14
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.440
Anthony Taylor: of machine learning. Okay?

15
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:23.509
Anthony Taylor:  the ll, everything that you guys you know, kind of join this platform is all based off of what we are going to start covering.

16
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.000
Anthony Taylor: Say that.

17
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.670
Anthony Taylor: So the next, like.

18
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:36.949
Anthony Taylor: 9 weeks is pretty much nothing but machine learning and projects.

19
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.590
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, whole weeks of machine learning.

20
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.290
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and then you're gonna do a project, too.

21
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.030
Anthony Taylor: So that kind of gives you idea next til the seventeenth week.

22
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.990
Anthony Taylor: So

23
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.920
Anthony Taylor: time series. Anybody heard of time series. Anybody know what I'm talking about. I think time series.

24
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.610
Anthony Taylor: who's my finances? Data over time? Basically, yeah.

25
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:19.200
Anthony Taylor: right? That is the base definition of time series. It's data measured over time. Which, when we really think about it, that's practically all. D

26
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.479
Anthony Taylor: okay. Oh, there's my finance person.

27
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.610
Anthony Taylor: I have to give her grief officially.

28
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.680
Anthony Taylor: Meredith.

29
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.910
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I'm here. Sorry. I just asked the question. And I said, Where's my finances?

30
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.860
Meredith McCanse (she/her): And you weren't there?

31
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:52.819
Anthony Taylor: I was having boot up problems. I had to restart my computer so anyway, today we're gonna start time soon.

32
00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:03.940
Anthony Taylor:  we are. Gonna begin the class kind of talking about time and machine learning kind of doing a little bit of a review, because I think we talked about machine learning cool.

33
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:12.470
Anthony Taylor: We're going to use pandas to manipulate some time data so that we are better at it

34
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.809
Anthony Taylor: and making it more consistent.

35
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.919
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna do some data analysis on some time series data.

36
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.089
Anthony Taylor: We're here to identify some patterns using real stock market data.

37
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.399
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna use some visualizations on that date.

38
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.300
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so that'll be fun. Welcome.

39
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.740
Anthony Taylor: That's enough of that. Alright. So let's recap.

40
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.610
Anthony Taylor: What do you know about machine learning? What can? There's II mentioned to you there was like 2

41
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.809
Anthony Taylor: primary categories of machine learning anybody remember what they are.

42
00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:11.230
Anthony Taylor: Oh, actually, Derek got it supervised and unsupervised. I know when you were going sign structured and unstructured. That's type data. But still it's stuff, right? So right. The 2 main categories.

43
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:18.619
Anthony Taylor: our our supervisor. Anybody remember other than Derek? Anybody remember the difference what they are? What's struck? What's supervised?

44
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.669
Dipinto, Matt: The supervised has targets for the model to train to.

45
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.439
Anthony Taylor: Awesome. Is Sonya. Did you want to answer unsupervised then?

46
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:43.859
sonja baro: Well, he took the easy one. Now answer is for structured. We don't know that the answer is for unstructured or unsupervised, and they use clustering techniques to primarily. Yeah.

47
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.639
sonja baro: that's good. That's exactly no, that was it. No

48
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.160
Anthony Taylor: unsupervised. We? We just don't know the answer to train the model.

49
00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:03.270
Anthony Taylor: So usually in unsupervised, we're just training the model blindly and telling it, hey. go out and find relationships in this data or patterns that we can't

50
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.940
Anthony Taylor: probably can't see

51
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:13.660
Anthony Taylor:  which is interesting when we get to Llm. Talk. That's kind of what Llm have done that are kind of remarkable

52
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.460
Anthony Taylor: is they have found relationships in words

53
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.260
Anthony Taylor: or in concepts

54
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.899
Anthony Taylor: that humans have not been able to find.

55
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:31.070
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And that's why, you know, I think I've said this recently. That's why they're discovering new medicines.

56
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:40.940
Anthony Taylor: They're discovering, you know, a a lot of new things now due to these the ais that are now available to everybody?

57
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.980
Anthony Taylor: because they're finding relationships that didn't that no one had seen before.

58
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but believe it or not lens are not driven by unsupervised learning.

59
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.310
Anthony Taylor: We'll get to that later.

60
00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:05.790
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so machine learning algorithm automatically. So this is the definition, we're going to go with a machine learning algorithm automatically adapts to improve the accuracy of precision of outcomes and predictions

61
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.210
Anthony Taylor: eliminating the need for manual configuration inputs and adjustments to the output

62
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.480
Anthony Taylor: alright. They can learn autonomously. So developers don't need to code for every scenario.

63
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:28.379
Anthony Taylor: So when I read that, does that make you think that machine learning program can figure stuff out itself.

64
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.659
Anthony Taylor: It's kind of what sounded like, right?

65
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.680
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, that's not true.

66
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:40.410
Anthony Taylor: What it can do is look at past data.

67
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.100
Anthony Taylor: find

68
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.360
Anthony Taylor: correlations. We talked about correlation

69
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.830
Anthony Taylor: that may not have been obvious, or

70
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:59.790
Anthony Taylor: it can combine correlations in such a way that maybe something that is barely correlated at all is actually having effect

71
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:10.960
Anthony Taylor: on what that pattern outputs. Okay? And so mathematically, it goes through it. It figures all these relationships and trends and patterns

72
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.110
Anthony Taylor: out and then outputs a prediction with a probability

73
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.689
Anthony Taylor: of being right.

74
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:23.170
Anthony Taylor: No prediction. And you guys are, gonna see this in coming weeks. No prediction

75
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.940
Anthony Taylor: actually says yes or no. It's all a probability

76
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.949
Anthony Taylor: 90%. We're pretty sure. Maybe it's right.

77
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

78
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:40.440
Anthony Taylor: 90% made pop. okay, so we're gonna learn to

79
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.640
Anthony Taylor: to translate all of that. Yeah, click.

80
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:50.679
Clayton Graves: So does that mean that machine learning algorithms can do what we were doing manually

81
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.300
Clayton Graves: the other day? No.

82
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:59.749
Anthony Taylor: no, they can't. They really can't, can't do anything that you that doesn't have a pattern or a trend.

83
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:13.530
Clayton Graves: Okay? So they they can't calculate correlation between 2 things. Not really. No, I mean they they, the the models themselves possibly do correlation calculations underneath while they're while they're developing

84
00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:19.030
Anthony Taylor: an an outlook effectively. This is what a machine learning model does. Maybe this will help

85
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:26.759
Anthony Taylor: right? So it starts digging. It starts looking at these patterns. It comes up with correlations it comes up with, hey? If we put these.

86
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.430
Anthony Taylor: you know these 10 features together, this is the out.

87
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:39.569
Anthony Taylor: then these 10 features. This is the output, and it compares those and says, Okay, well, is it always that way, you know? And it's it's not. It's complicated

88
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.470
Anthony Taylor: fitting a machine learning model, which is training.

89
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay, can take

90
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:50.620
Anthony Taylor: weeks 24, 7 massive amount of computer power.

91
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:56.369
Anthony Taylor: You guys have heard the train chat TPT. Is like the equivalent of, like.

92
00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:00.950
Anthony Taylor: you know, 10 years of California's traffic in pollution.

93
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:07.020
Anthony Taylor: That's that's just how bad it is just to train Chat t one.

94
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.620
Anthony Taylor: Now the good news is we don't train them a lot. But

95
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:14.670
Anthony Taylor: when you guys are developing models, you do train them

96
00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:15.810
Anthony Taylor: often.

97
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:21.149
Anthony Taylor: many, many times, depending on how good the data is.

98
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:23.060
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

99
00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:38.680
Anthony Taylor:  so no to answer questions. They probably are absolutely using correlations in the background plate. But you look at correlations so that. And and as you're going to find the art of being a data scientist is understanding how to tune

100
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.770
Anthony Taylor: your model to get the best possible

101
00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:49.330
Anthony Taylor: accuracy that you can come up with for the least amount of money. So when it comes down to

102
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:59.559
Anthony Taylor: alright, we're gonna learn models as we go through that get progressively more expensive to run, they will cost us and think, cause we're not doing very much date.

103
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:05.459
Anthony Taylor: But if you through, you know a billion rows of data at some of these models.

104
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:13.859
Anthony Taylor: you know, they could take days to run constant CPU, maybe 50 to a hundred cpus

105
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:17.010
Anthony Taylor: running 24, 7 for days.

106
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.169
Anthony Taylor: Very expensive.

107
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:27.019
Anthony Taylor: right? But if you have somebody who knows what they're doing? Maybe they could tune that down to 8 h of 50 CPU,

108
00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:31.030
Anthony Taylor: and that comes from doing the data analysis like

109
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:37.660
Anthony Taylor: looking at correlations, looking at at what you have, and figuring out what the best combination is.

110
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:42.409
Anthony Taylor: Now here's the good news. One of the things that I find difficult

111
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.880
Clayton Graves: is no one

112
00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:52.470
Clayton Graves: what my data is supposed to look like when I'm when I'm completing some sort of task.

113
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:54.750
Clayton Graves: So my question is.

114
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.939
Clayton Graves: how do we know that the

115
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:04.879
Clayton Graves: 8 h model is just as accurate as the 24 h model.

116
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.549
Anthony Taylor: And that's how you're gonna earn your money.

117
00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:21.140
Anthony Taylor: That's it. Right. So me with. I do models. They expect I'm going to be able to get it down to best possible costs. Best possible answer as quickly as possible.

118
00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.500
Anthony Taylor: You guys at entry level. You're gonna be the 27 h model.

119
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.510
Anthony Taylor: Right? You're gonna be the longer one. Most likely

120
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:33.200
Anthony Taylor: the good news is by taking this class. You should have an edge on others.

121
00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:39.839
Anthony Taylor: you know. But again, let me go back. Those data analysts. I was talking about that work where I work. They've never done machine learning in their life.

122
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:52.330
Anthony Taylor: They're taking a workshop next Friday or next Thursday with me to learn what it is. They're gonna take the you know, this little, these 4 slides we're about to do. They don't even know this.

123
00:11:53.830 --> 00:12:05.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so you guys are so far ahead of it. But to answer your question. It's gonna take time. The good news is, there is some wonderful tools out there which I hope to be able to show you.

124
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:13.610
Anthony Taylor:  that actually do it awfully okay, and and leave you very little to have to worry about.

125
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:22.909
Anthony Taylor: You have to be fortunate enough to have them available to okay. so we use learning, we develop a statistical model

126
00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:30.459
Anthony Taylor: in the background. That's what it's doing of existing data that can automatically make predictions or decisions about new data.

127
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:34.339
Anthony Taylor: I hate this word automatic. It is not automatic.

128
00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.620
Anthony Taylor: it is mathematical.

129
00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:39.210
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

130
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:41.300
Anthony Taylor: that's that.

131
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:42.840
Alright.

132
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.180
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

133
00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:49.449
Anthony Taylor: So have we mentioned, if I ever said these 3 words to you guys together.

134
00:12:53.660 --> 00:13:05.640
Anthony Taylor: All right. So for the next 9 weeks, well, let's just say 7 weeks after project. Okay. you will hear me say, model fit predict 1,000 times

135
00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:12.370
Anthony Taylor: alright, model fit. Predict that's every single machine learning process

136
00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:15.159
Anthony Taylor: period and the story

137
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.920
Anthony Taylor: model fit predict

138
00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:22.189
Anthony Taylor: long as you when you're building out your pipeline.

139
00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.050
Anthony Taylor: What's the mommy? This one?

140
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.090
Anthony Taylor: How do I fit it this way?

141
00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.779
Anthony Taylor: Now I can predict that's it. Fitting is training, by the way.

142
00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.739
Anthony Taylor: So if you hear me say, Train your model fit is the same thing.

143
00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.720
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you would think that you would trade to become fit, but not a machine.

144
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:46.539
Anthony Taylor: Damn, not even a smile. Okay, so once trained or fit.

145
00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.869
Anthony Taylor: the model and algorithm can be used to make actual predictions.

146
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:57.080
Anthony Taylor: One thing that most programs, I'll tell you guys the secret. Here's a secret interview secret. Get ready.

147
00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay. When I interview data science

148
00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:11.970
Anthony Taylor: I will talk to, I'll say, Oh, so what models have you used? Oh, that's great! What preparate! And then what hyper parameters do you find? Or blah blah blah? And then I hit him with this question.

149
00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:15.209
Anthony Taylor: how do you

150
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.100
Anthony Taylor: put your model into production so other people can use it?

151
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.340
Anthony Taylor: And I will tell you right now. One in 10 can answer that question.

152
00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.610
Anthony Taylor: The other 9 don't know how they have no clue. How it works.

153
00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:35.549
Anthony Taylor: All they've done is they've built models to do predictions, but they've never actually put them into a production environment to use them.

154
00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.889
Anthony Taylor: Right? I'm gonna give you some good news right now.

155
00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.909
Anthony Taylor: You, every one of you, when you leave this class, not today

156
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:51.150
Anthony Taylor: will know how to do it. and we'll be able to do it, and we'll be able to demonstrate.

157
00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:56.379
Anthony Taylor: And here's the crazy part. Do you wanna know how long it's gonna take me to teach it to you.

158
00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.960
Anthony Taylor: 15 min.

159
00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.110
Anthony Taylor: everybody, no matter what you still love.

160
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.480
Anthony Taylor: When we get to that it will take me 15 min

161
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:11.160
Anthony Taylor: to teach you how to promote a model

162
00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:16.470
Anthony Taylor: to production and make it usable to people outside or inside your organization.

163
00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.090
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

164
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:24.690
Anthony Taylor: so that's a big deal. Most data. Science don't even not do it, because all they've done is what we're gonna do in class.

165
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:32.700
Anthony Taylor: They've made models. They've done great work. And they're like, I've done this. It's fantastic. 95% accurate

166
00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:36.389
Anthony Taylor: like, that's awesome. Who uses it? Well, I

167
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:40.139
Anthony Taylor: that doesn't make a lot of sense.

168
00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:50.309
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So here we go, supervise learning. We gonna do classification. We're gonna do. Regression. Regression is continuous number prediction. We've already talked about that up here.

169
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:57.240
Anthony Taylor: Regression does not have to be just linear. That's just one line. You can have multilinear.

170
00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:06.510
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you can do regression in much more complicated machine learning algorithms. It's just means it's continuous numbers. That's it.

171
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:14.439
Anthony Taylor: Classification. This is the one you see most of the time. This is, are they a good credit risk?

172
00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:25.300
Anthony Taylor: what website should I send them? To? What video do you want to see? What music should I recommend? You would think that'd be a recommendation engine. Sometimes it is.

173
00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:26.470
Anthony Taylor: but

174
00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.289
Anthony Taylor: sometimes it's just about patient.

175
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.500
Anthony Taylor: That's right.

176
00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:41.370
Masarirambi, Rodney: Just to just to clarify regression is not the programming regression, as in like, we just introduced a regression to stop things from working in this.

177
00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:43.689
Masarirambi, Rodney: but totally different. Right?

178
00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:53.949
Anthony Taylor: Correct. Remember, we were doing linear regression last class, the line going up between. That's a regression. So it it basically just means we're trying to predict a number.

179
00:16:55.220 --> 00:17:00.050
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's pretty much. And you can see the forecasting real estate prices, population growth

180
00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.810
Anthony Taylor: predicting financial returns, weather forecast

181
00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:05.300
Anthony Taylor: predicting a number.

182
00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:07.900
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

183
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:13.980
Anthony Taylor: no, no, that's a great question. So unsupervised learning, we don't know the answer. When we train our model.

184
00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:21.409
Anthony Taylor: We do clustering. Now, I will tell you. Recommendation systems sometimes can also fall into clustering makes perfect sense.

185
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.889
Anthony Taylor: Jennifer likes these 10 songs. She's told us she does

186
00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:33.099
Anthony Taylor: aft, listened to one of those 10 songs. Well, let's see if he likes the other night

187
00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.469
Anthony Taylor: recommendation engine. Basically how they work.

188
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.330
Anthony Taylor: We're going to get way more into that

189
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:47.769
Anthony Taylor: and then dimensionality reduction. That's a big giant word, for we're gonna make our data a little less complex.

190
00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:59.410
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So you have 500 columns in your table. You're trying to make a prediction on one column. So that's 499 features.

191
00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:00.900
Anthony Taylor: That's a lot.

192
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:11.880
Anthony Taylor: We can use unsupervised learning to do dimensionality reduction and maybe reduce those 499 down to say 20. That actually means something.

193
00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:16.829
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And that's what this this is gonna do. We're gonna do that as well.

194
00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.050
Anthony Taylor: So all of these things we're gonna do in this box.

195
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.040
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

196
00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:25.430
Anthony Taylor: alright, we already talked about that.

197
00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.380
Anthony Taylor: And we talked about that

198
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.030
Anthony Taylor: classification, basically A or B

199
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.279
Anthony Taylor: 4, A, BCDE, FG.

200
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:44.780
Anthony Taylor: It could be any number. It doesn't have to be 2 things. It could be 20 things. It could be a thousand things or simply classifying it based on the date.

201
00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:49.579
Anthony Taylor: Okay, regression, continuous number just talked about.

202
00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:56.190
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Hey? You guys did a video today? I know you're excited.

203
00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:01.230
Anthony Taylor: Oh, wait! I gotta change my share. I didn't put on sound hold on 1 s

204
00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:11.870
Anthony Taylor: optimize for video. It's only 1 min and 10 s. So don't be too excited. Alright, here we go

205
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:37.700
on the Internet. The algorithms are all around you. You are watching this video because an algorithm brought it to you, among others, to click, which you did. And the algorithm took note. When you open the Tweetbook, a, the algorithm decides what you see when you search through your photos, a, the algorithm does the finding maybe even makes a little movie for you. When you buy something a, the algorithm sets the price and a the algorithm is at your bank watching

206
00:19:37.700 --> 00:20:02.010
actions for fraud. The stock market is full of algorithms trading with algorithms. Given this, you might want to know how these little algorithmic bots shaping your world work, especially when they don't. In ye olden days humans built algorithmic bots by giving them instructions. The humans could explain if this, then that. But many problems are just too big and hard for a human to write simple instructions, for

207
00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:25.679
there's a gazillion, financial transactions a second which ones are fraudulent. There's octillion videos on Netmetube, which 8 should the user see as recommendations which shouldn't be allowed on the site at all for this airline seat, what is the maximum price this user will pay right now. Algorithmic bots give answers to these questions, not perfect answers, but much better than a human could do. But how? These?

208
00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.640
Anthony Taylor: That's where it told me to stop.

209
00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:31.990
Anthony Taylor: It's like 9 min long.

210
00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:44.940
Anthony Taylor: The algorithm didn't tell me to stop there. The lesson plan did. Okay. So you know, that's cool. I mean, I don't know that that told us anything we didn't know. But maybe you did

211
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:52.589
Anthony Taylor: right. I mean, the bottom line is pretty much everything you do. Even now, the one that always be is the airplane

212
00:20:53.170 --> 00:21:01.519
Anthony Taylor: right? The ticket. You see what it said there. it didn't decide what the ticket was worth. It decided how much you pay for that ticket.

213
00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:07.530
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So that's an interesting little tidbit.

214
00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:17.199
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I read something recently about Uber rates that uber will. If your phone battery is dying. Uber will charge you a higher rate.

215
00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.539
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I think, with the assumption that

216
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:24.359
Meredith McCanse (she/her): you have a limited

217
00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:29.619
Meredith McCanse (she/her): which is just evil, that, like but it

218
00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:36.189
Meredith McCanse (she/her): supply and demand. Everything is, I mean in the end.

219
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:37.970
Anthony Taylor: Adam.

220
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:43.530
Anthony Taylor: not. There's not a lot of people out there that are looking to to judge did not align their pockets

221
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:56.289
Anthony Taylor: at least a little bit right. I love doing this. I was just talking about this earlier today. I said, I love doing this. I would do this. I mean it pays me significantly less than my day job, but I love doing it so I don't care. It's what I want to do

222
00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:06.989
Anthony Taylor: right. And and and it's it's because it makes me feel good to help. But you know, if they didn't pay me anything, you guys would have a different feature.

223
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:12.420
Anthony Taylor: Right? So in the end, we definitely, you know, all do.

224
00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:20.120
Anthony Taylor: Some things are many thing. People in big organizations more than anybody else do. A ton of

225
00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:32.130
Anthony Taylor: got a line pockets if nothing else got to do it. So you have investors need. Those investors need those stockholders make money, or they don't keep you anymore. Somebody else will come in. That will make the money.

226
00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:36.859
Anthony Taylor: So yeah, I agree. That is, that's harsh, that's evil.

227
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:46.009
Anthony Taylor:  You know. How long is it before they have your credit report right there whenever you're you know, so they can see your salary. Oh, look at this guy. Yeah.

228
00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:52.080
Anthony Taylor: okay, we'll charge you 20 more, just because you know, basically, when the salary

229
00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:57.030
Anthony Taylor: I wouldn't even doubt that's already happened someplace

230
00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:08.789
Anthony Taylor: so now we're able to decide what price really to pay a particular moment? 100%. We just talked about that predicts which financial transactions are fraudulent. How many of you got? How many. You got that phone call?

231
00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.520
Anthony Taylor: Hi, I think it's a robot or something.

232
00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:18.579
Anthony Taylor: Did you just charge $340 at that bed bath and beyond

233
00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.109
Anthony Taylor: right. And you're like.

234
00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.270
Anthony Taylor: do I have to admit it?

235
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:41.450
Anthony Taylor: But then you say, press one. If that was you right? Yeah, I mean, have you all got that call or something like it. I spent all day on Friday dealing with a potential fraud situation because I downloaded an app that tracks my spending.

236
00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:55.569
Mason, Natalie: and it didn't recognize a charge. And it's because it didn't really have a definition within what it was. It just said, like golden pos golden Co, us, and I'm like scratching my head

237
00:23:55.930 --> 00:24:08.060
Mason, Natalie: like, what could this be? What could this be? It's like on days that I didn't spend this money. I'm like, well, somebody's just draining my account. 95 bucks, 95 bucks. It was me going to physical therapy.

238
00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:13.810
Mason, Natalie: but I spent hours just being afraid that I was getting ripped off.

239
00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:16.920
Mason, Natalie: But luckily I wasn't. So that's

240
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:20.840
Mason, Natalie: well, that is, that is good. They should have called you

241
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.540
Anthony Taylor: right?

242
00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:26.539
Anthony Taylor: anyway. So yeah. So that's that's cool stuff.

243
00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:32.379
Anthony Taylor: Algorithms continuously trade against other algorithms stock market. This is a crazy thing

244
00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:34.209
Anthony Taylor: when you think about it.

245
00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:40.989
Anthony Taylor: right? The algorithms are trading based on rules that someone has created or that they've been trained to teach to trade on.

246
00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:43.819
Anthony Taylor: And here's my best story. On this

247
00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:49.959
Anthony Taylor: again. I might have mentioned this one, too, but hurts. I told you guys hurt watches, avis

248
00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:57.589
Anthony Taylor: right? And a this watches hurts, and they both watch enterprise, and they're constantly comparing rates.

249
00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:59.579
Anthony Taylor: Here's the crazy part.

250
00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:04.389
Anthony Taylor: When they receive the rate, they will lower their rate

251
00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:06.770
Anthony Taylor: below that rate.

252
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:15.929
Anthony Taylor: So mid-size car on a Saturday in Orlando from Avis will cost you 58 bucks a day.

253
00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.590
Anthony Taylor: Hertz gets that information, makes it 57. But

254
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:27.130
Anthony Taylor: Avis gets that information, makes it 56 bucks a day enterprise. We'll show them we'll make it 55.

255
00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:37.900
Anthony Taylor: So there's this constant craziness going on in that industry. But they all had to put rules in place, because when they first heard it on, guess what happened.

256
00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:41.660
Anthony Taylor: everything dropped to 0.

257
00:25:44.210 --> 00:26:01.480
Anthony Taylor: They had to stop it like immediately, like holy cow. Why? Because everyone was saying, oh, we gotta be lower the neck I got so they all have base rules they had to put in for each card type in each location that said, Look, go down, but never go below this point. Now

258
00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:04.029
Anthony Taylor: think they had one at the top side of that?

259
00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:05.720
Yeah.

260
00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:12.230
Anthony Taylor: So when Avis raised the prices Hertz free, Hertz would just go adjust under that price.

261
00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:23.949
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so what would happen was they would flip that they would flip the script every once in a while. I'm short on inventory and Avis. I'm short on inventory. I have to raise the price

262
00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:29.999
Anthony Taylor: right well hurts now knows that Avis is short on inventory. So what are they going to do?

263
00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:37.029
Anthony Taylor: Raise the price cheaper? The name is. but they're still gonna raise price

264
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:41.490
Anthony Taylor: because they now know that there's less cars and avis for people to rent

265
00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.620
Anthony Taylor: making what demand high.

266
00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:51.450
Anthony Taylor: So all these things have the stock trading algorithms to me is the same thing

267
00:26:51.820 --> 00:27:01.969
Anthony Taylor: like they trade, they trade, you know this one buys, this one sells for different rules, and you know, I tell you Kevin was with the last cohort.

268
00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:08.889
Anthony Taylor: II would say, almost every cohort I've taught. I have had at least one group of students tell me that they have

269
00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:10.690
Anthony Taylor: match the stock market

270
00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:13.730
Anthony Taylor: 98% accuracy. They can predict it.

271
00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:16.959
Anthony Taylor: 98% access.

272
00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:23.479
Anthony Taylor: Normally, they realize before the class is over that that's not true.

273
00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:27.230
Anthony Taylor: But the model says it's 98% accurate.

274
00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:32.100
Anthony Taylor: Okay, would you guys probably run into that? At least one of

275
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:36.490
Anthony Taylor: alright. It's just not possible. If it were possible, the whole world would blow up.

276
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:45.759
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. You all seen that new movie yet, what with Julia, Julia Roberts and Kevin Bacon. it would be like that, though.

277
00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:53.099
Anthony Taylor: Meredith said, yes, she saw it. I hated the ending. Just so, you know. But I'm not gonna say what it was.

278
00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:56.529
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I like the ending.

279
00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:57.500
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

280
00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:02.940
Anthony Taylor: Oh, funny. Okay, anyway. it is. It is interesting.

281
00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:04.460
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

282
00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:09.969
Anthony Taylor:  so now let's talk about the main topic of the day.

283
00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:10.970
Anthony Taylor: Aye.

284
00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:24.579
Anthony Taylor:  it's vital in pretty much all of our models, most of our not all of our models will have a time aspect, but pretty much. Everything has a time series.

285
00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:31.600
Anthony Taylor: a component whether or not it be included in the models we're working on? It's everything changes over time.

286
00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.700
Anthony Taylor: right? So your willingness to pay for something might depend on the time of day.

287
00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:40.159
Anthony Taylor: That's true. right? Or the time of year.

288
00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:47.390
Anthony Taylor: Okay, clearly, we will spend money on holidays even.

289
00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.870
Anthony Taylor: I'm sure everyone is feeling that right now.

290
00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:53.900
Anthony Taylor: That's just made it.

291
00:28:54.080 --> 00:29:04.460
Anthony Taylor: Financial transactions that occur very late at night, or very early, tend to be fraudulent, and more often to be fraudulent than what happens in the middle of the day.

292
00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:10.970
Anthony Taylor: I don't understand that I ever decide to do a fraudulent transaction. I'm gonna do it while eating lunch.

293
00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:16.150
Anthony Taylor: Best way to get away with it, I guess. Okay.

294
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:23.909
Anthony Taylor: profitable strategies might appear and disappear, depending on market conditions that change constantly over time.

295
00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:28.470
Anthony Taylor: that what we're here to talk about today.

296
00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:29.940
Anthony Taylor: I,

297
00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:38.890
Anthony Taylor:  okay. So for machine learning to actually be able to do anything.

298
00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.560
Anthony Taylor: you have to have history.

299
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:45.890
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it it it it doesn't. It's it's

300
00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:51.879
Anthony Taylor: while you could give it like, well, here's 10 min of history. Couldn't predict something, maybe.

301
00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.659
Anthony Taylor: But I mean, it's not gonna be very reliable.

302
00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:57.100
Anthony Taylor: More history the more reliable.

303
00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:00.170
Anthony Taylor: the more accurate. Right?

304
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:07.150
Anthony Taylor:  so there's lots of stuff where supervised learning and time series comes in play.

305
00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:12.670
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Hold on. Let's see if they have examples to give you.

306
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.919
Anthony Taylor: Nope. just the ones we talked about

307
00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:23.370
Anthony Taylor: might lead us to buy warm clothes in the winter. Yeah.

308
00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:28.780
Not only our behavior, but how the world works

309
00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:32.620
Anthony Taylor: make sense.

310
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:36.580
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so really, nothing exciting. And we do

311
00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:38.160
Anthony Taylor: so.

312
00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:40.650
Anthony Taylor: oh, these, that's these right

313
00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:47.729
Anthony Taylor: when to make an investment, and positive money in your savings account might change over time.

314
00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:51.729
Anthony Taylor: I didn't care much about my 401 K. When I was a young man.

315
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:59.679
Anthony Taylor: As I grew older I realized, dang it, they'll match it 100. That's free money.

316
00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:05.130
Anthony Taylor: That wasn't a time thing. That was an intelligence thing.

317
00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:08.030
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

318
00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:13.420
Anthony Taylor:  So anything where you see data changing

319
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:15.050
Anthony Taylor: over time

320
00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.269
Anthony Taylor: is time series.

321
00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:22.259
Anthony Taylor: Okay, finance. Everything is time series. Pretty much

322
00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:31.780
Anthony Taylor: alright. It goes up, it goes down. You make more, you make less. spend more. You spend less over time. Okay.

323
00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:38.049
Anthony Taylor: so in this class today, you're gonna learn how to manipulate time.

324
00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.909
Anthony Taylor: We don't mean like, go in the future. We're not, gonna

325
00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:45.179
Anthony Taylor: you know. Be Doc Brown, or anything like that.

326
00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:52.380
Anthony Taylor: Rodney's like, who the hell is, Doc? Grab?

327
00:31:52.560 --> 00:32:00.819
Anthony Taylor: No, no, no, that III was promised that we were going to be manipulating time. So I'm out. So

328
00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:03.250
Kanouff, Christine: you have seen the back to the feature.

329
00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:04.840
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

330
00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:08.429
Anthony Taylor: I guess, Doctor, who might have been a good one, too. But I don't watch that

331
00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:23.239
Anthony Taylor: anyway. So the probably most important thing we're gonna learn about time today is how to make sure our data is in the right format and assistant format so that we can then use it for machine learning.

332
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:30.550
Anthony Taylor: And with that you can construct more intricate time series models, including those capable making predictions across.

333
00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:31.730
Anthony Taylor: I'm

334
00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:34.070
right.

335
00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:38.840
Anthony Taylor: So that was a lot of stuff. Any questions about any of that before we move on.

336
00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:46.749
Clayton Graves: So when I open my weather app and I look at the 10 day forecast. Is is that

337
00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.339
Clayton Graves: what I'm dealing with then

338
00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:52.289
Anthony Taylor: in Denver. Yes.

339
00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:55.840
Anthony Taylor: in Texas, yes. in California.

340
00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:01.219
Anthony Taylor: in California it's the same weather, every

341
00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:19.790
Anthony Taylor: right. So it's not much of a prediction, but everywhere else. They actually have to look at the what the you know. Look thing, and they're not looking necessarily like weather's an interesting one, because weather looks at patterns, of course, but it's also looking at the current data and comparing it to existing patterns.

342
00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:29.519
Anthony Taylor: So it says, well, the committed this, the clouds are this. The wind's doing this, the parameters, this blah blah blah blah blah! All of these things taken into consideration.

343
00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:35.839
Anthony Taylor: And you know, we're gonna say that yeah, we should be approaching these temperatures. I mean meteorology

344
00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:42.210
Anthony Taylor: more than just machine learning. But it's the same concepts whether or not they apply an algorithm to do it.

345
00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:47.090
Anthony Taylor: or they're doing it with science diet

346
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:50.240
Anthony Taylor: right? It's hard to say

347
00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:51.650
Anthony Taylor: yes, right?

348
00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:58.329
Masarirambi, Rodney: Not really a question per se. But you might gone back to the slide just before just wanted to take a look at that again.

349
00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:10.370
Anthony Taylor: Thank you. Just like the cool puppet oh, I hadn't finished like taking all this, then? Oh, yeah.

350
00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:13.899
Anthony Taylor: But yeah. So any other questions?

351
00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:16.760
Anthony Taylor: Those were good questions

352
00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:24.080
Anthony Taylor: like it. am I good to turn off the slide? I'm gonna go and give you guys a demo. Now.

353
00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:26.749
Anthony Taylor: actually, am I?

354
00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.239
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, are you good. With this one run?

355
00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:31.630
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

356
00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.710
Anthony Taylor: The importance of time.

357
00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:42.109
Anthony Taylor: You guys remind me of the importance of time when you come back from that activity going to break out.

358
00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:46.919
Anthony Taylor: Right? Yeah. Okay.

359
00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:54.699
Anthony Taylor: Oh, the time plays a role in multitude. So discovering, obviously, you know, EKG. Heart mining reading a particular point in time.

360
00:34:54.770 --> 00:35:02.490
Anthony Taylor: Aggregations, daily revenue of a firm has failed forecasting. What's tomorrow's time? Gonna be? What's it fails. Gonna be

361
00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:06.330
Anthony Taylor: okay. All important aspects, time.

362
00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:18.520
Anthony Taylor: the model and predict future prevents in time. We need the ability to handle everything that relates to time data. I love anytime. I see a word like everything. I immediately send up the alerts. Okay.

363
00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:23.789
Anthony Taylor: the ability to handle everything that relates to time data.

364
00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:32.360
Anthony Taylor: Okay, when dealing with data across the world. This one makes sense. We need the ability to convert time zones. This is one of the biggest headache

365
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:39.270
Anthony Taylor: of data engineers. Okay, and application developers. hey? Time zones.

366
00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:44.329
Anthony Taylor: especially the idiots that came up Ben Franklin

367
00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:46.460
Anthony Taylor: with daylight savings stock.

368
00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:48.570
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Excuse me.

369
00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:51.080
Anthony Taylor: Aye.

370
00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:59.979
Anthony Taylor: to recognize patterns and time data. We need the ability to resample our data converting hourly data to daily data or daily data to weekly data.

371
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:03.900
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this we're going to do today.

372
00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.820
Anthony Taylor: And this.

373
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:07.250
Anthony Taylor: okay.

374
00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:12.079
Anthony Taylor: cool thing is, pandas has some really nice ways to do it.

375
00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:24.600
Anthony Taylor:  yeah, let's keep going. I'm gonna eventually get to the demo. Today's class. We're going to learn about, python ended, using time and date time.

376
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:27.750
Anthony Taylor:  it.

377
00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:32.970
Anthony Taylor: I would say. I would argue that date and time.

378
00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:35.240
Anthony Taylor: There's probably

379
00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:39.979
Anthony Taylor: in the top 5. Most difficult things to deal with in program.

380
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:42.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay, overall.

381
00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:46.680
Anthony Taylor: We all have. I mean, I have that have the Bible

382
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:55.230
Anthony Taylor: template. I give the entire team with every date conversion I could come up with. And it's still not enough.

383
00:36:57.170 --> 00:37:00.350
Anthony Taylor: Okay for them to figure it out without asking for

384
00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:06.299
Anthony Taylor: it's just a pain in the butt. But people change stuff all the time.

385
00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:23.580
Anthony Taylor:  so there's a lot of ways to format time. You know. We talked about this before Rami and his bizarre type format right? And then the rest of us, with our absolutely normal only happens in the United States dive format.

386
00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:25.970
Anthony Taylor: Right? Yeah.

387
00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:35.549
Anthony Taylor:  So as you learned in earlier units, python append is supply function available to do that. And that's 100%. True.

388
00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.190
Anthony Taylor: Candace hasn't covered. We're good.

389
00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.830
Anthony Taylor: We are going to play with some stock market date.

390
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:44.130
Anthony Taylor: Okay? In fact, let's go do that now.

391
00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:47.429
Anthony Taylor: So in

392
00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:51.650
Anthony Taylor: Instructor one you haven't already looked at.

393
00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:58.060
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna bring in pandas. And we have some S and P data.

394
00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:03.649
Anthony Taylor: Now. first characteristic of time series data.

395
00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:09.499
Anthony Taylor: there is date time values, or at least date or time values.

396
00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:13.539
Anthony Taylor: In this case these are just pure timestamps.

397
00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:18.669
Anthony Taylor: Okay, these are the values, that's all we have in this particular.

398
00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:24.550
Anthony Taylor: If we look at the types, though we have a little bit of an issue, don't we?

399
00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:29.010
Anthony Taylor: Is that time column actually a date?

400
00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:38.490
Anthony Taylor: Not according to Python. Python sees it as an object, which means it's a string.

401
00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:42.180
Anthony Taylor: So first thing we have to do

402
00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:44.420
Anthony Taylor: is converted.

403
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:51.400
Anthony Taylor: So if we just take a look at one of them we can see. Okay? Well, sure. Looks like a date time.

404
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:53.290
Anthony Taylor: I'm feeling pretty good about that.

405
00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:58.200
Anthony Taylor: Let me show you what a daytime object looks like in pandas

406
00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:01.239
Anthony Taylor: a little. It looks pretty similar.

407
00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:05.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this is a timestamp in pandas.

408
00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:07.380
Anthony Taylor: Very simple.

409
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:10.240
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so this is a real one.

410
00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:13.100
Anthony Taylor: To convert it.

411
00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:24.909
Anthony Taylor: Here's the brains. Here's the part of this part of the class that we need to know. Okay. Pd, dot 2 date time pass in the column. You want to convert.

412
00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:26.450
Anthony Taylor: Does time come?

413
00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:31.800
Anthony Taylor: I will tell you right now. This will give you a warning.

414
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.239
Anthony Taylor: and we're not going to use it throughout the entire class. But we will start class with it.

415
00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:42.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and then Utc, does anybody know what Utc is?

416
00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:49.760
Masarirambi, Rodney: I know Greenwich time?

417
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:52.090
Anthony Taylor: Wait. What'd you say.

418
00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:55.910
Anthony Taylor: Rodney.

419
00:39:56.340 --> 00:40:06.170
Anthony Taylor: doesn't it match like greenish? Meantime, or something like that. I love that you said that. And look, I'll show you some, so don't look at the bottom corner yet

420
00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:20.039
Anthony Taylor: coordinated. Universal design is this time standard that anyone in the world can use to specify an exact moment in time, regardless of where they live. Utc doesn't adjust for daylight saving time, which is what differentiates it from

421
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:21.980
Anthony Taylor: Greenwich. Mean time.

422
00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:26.429
Anthony Taylor: okay, Utc doesn't care.

423
00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:34.269
Anthony Taylor: And usually what you'll see is, you know, minus 4 minus 5.

424
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:38.349
Anthony Taylor: Okay. alongside at Utc.

425
00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:45.870
Anthony Taylor: So like standard Utc time standard also matches London's time zone. So it's plus 0 in England.

426
00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:48.400
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

427
00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:54.999
Anthony Taylor: alright. So anything else. There is a database called the time zone database.

428
00:40:55.180 --> 00:41:09.059
Anthony Taylor: And it basically has all of the pluses and minuses for every time zone in the world. It's really not as many as you might think. Okay, but there's pretty much a plus and minus on both sides.

429
00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:12.000
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna do date date time in just a moment.

430
00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:21.379
Anthony Taylor:  just a quick note. The term timestamp in pandas is the same thing as date time almost everywhere else.

431
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:27.250
Anthony Taylor: Alright, when you see timestamp date time. The same thing.

432
00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:31.719
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Alright. Now we'll do the

433
00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:36.050
Anthony Taylor: alright. So we're gonna run this. It's gonna give us a warning.

434
00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:44.539
Anthony Taylor: What's the warning? Say? Infer date, time, format is deprecated, and will no longer work in the future, for now it still works.

435
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:53.489
Anthony Taylor: Putting Utc equals. True means it's going to output the time value at Utc time.

436
00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:58.750
Anthony Taylor: If you do not do this, it will convert it at your time zone.

437
00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:04.509
Anthony Taylor: So that also means. Well, here, let's take a look.

438
00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:10.590
Anthony Taylor: Oh, wait! That would convert it. So

439
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:11.970
let's see

440
00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:19.310
Anthony Taylor: let's see if we run. No got it, no matter what I run. It's gonna mess with it. So

441
00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.500
Anthony Taylor: let's just copy this down here

442
00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:25.279
Anthony Taylor: after the conversion.

443
00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:29.290
Anthony Taylor: Come on.

444
00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:37.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So right now, this is saying it's all at at at 0 Utc, which

445
00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:40.809
Anthony Taylor: makes sense because all of our data was at plus 0 also.

446
00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:45.630
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So now we're going to convert it.

447
00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:51.880
Anthony Taylor: 2 us Easter minus 4. Right?

448
00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:57.770
Anthony Taylor: You guys are not Eastern, you might not know. So do you have 500? New York is

449
00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:00.729
Anthony Taylor: when when the Macy's parade comes on. It's always early.

450
00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:09.789
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to run that don't really see a whole lot of change except in this info. It shows us US. Eastern.

451
00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:14.160
Anthony Taylor: and if we look at the data, it now all says, minus 5

452
00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:17.080
Anthony Taylor: stupid daylight savings time.

453
00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:21.670
Anthony Taylor: I was minus 4 just a few weeks ago.

454
00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:26.870
Anthony Taylor: Promise okay? Questions. Yes, right?

455
00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:34.470
Masarirambi, Rodney: So if that, if you go back up, it was saying that when you got the warning and saying it was

456
00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:36.300
Masarirambi, Rodney: so, what

457
00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:41.840
Masarirambi, Rodney: what's gonna replace. It's in the solution. I think II already put it in one of the

458
00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:44.180
Anthony Taylor: you haven't seen it yet, but you will. Today

459
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:50.919
Anthony Taylor: I knew you were. Gonna ask that. I didn't say I didn't think Rodney's gonna ask that. But I figured somebody is gonna ask.

460
00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.520
Anthony Taylor: what do we do about that warning.

461
00:43:54.170 --> 00:44:03.410
Clayton Graves: I'm on it. What did you do? Linear regression to to to predict that, or what? What did you use to predict? It's not a prediction. It's simply. It's just a

462
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:06.089
Anthony Taylor: the bottom line is, is, there's a format.

463
00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:12.829
Anthony Taylor: This is a format you have to put in. I was joking. It's fine, Meredith.

464
00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:19.570
Meredith McCanse (she/her): In the step where you converted it to us. Eastern

465
00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:27.659
Meredith McCanse (she/her): is the at the end in parentheses where it says us Eastern. I'm assuming that's the part where you tell it. Which

466
00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:30.630
Meredith McCanse (she/her): zone to convert to?

467
00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:40.610
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Is there a. So is there like a list of the different options? Because you probably can't just write anything there. Right? You have to.

468
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:47.010
Anthony Taylor: Yes. and let's see

469
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:55.349
Anthony Taylor: Tzi converts. I was hoping it would actually have it in here for the formatting it does

470
00:44:56.540 --> 00:45:01.550
Anthony Taylor:  Europe, Berlin, us Central European?

471
00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:13.030
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Or is it one of those things that will start populating while you type it? Because it's standardized? Probably it might, but I wouldn't count on it. We need to find

472
00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:16.239
Anthony Taylor: the list that it's comfortable with.

473
00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:21.849
Anthony Taylor: I'll hunt that down for you.

474
00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:31.080
Anthony Taylor: I assumed you would just come in here and be able to find it. But I mean, we could look at the source code and see. But it has to get it somewhere. Also.

475
00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:40.520
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

476
00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:49.039
Anthony Taylor: yeah, it's gotta get it somewhere.

477
00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:55.590
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, I'll hunt it down for you or Kevin if you want to hunt it down. That'd be great.

478
00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:07.739
Anthony Taylor: Bottom line is is is, yeah, it's probably just the the standard like, whatever the standard statement is. Us Eastern Us. Central, us. you know, mountain

479
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:09.099
Anthony Taylor: for you guys

480
00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:11.370
Anthony Taylor: stuff like that. But

481
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:15.850
Anthony Taylor: yeah, I didn't think to look that one up. Meredith, darn it.

482
00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:23.159
Anthony Taylor: no worries. Thank you. Okay, no, that's good. I'm glad. Okay. So now, you guys need to do that

483
00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:29.940
Anthony Taylor: pretty much all day to day is all about. Have the instructor on one side, you on the other. Okay.

484
00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:42.080
Anthony Taylor: it's very much like that. Alright.  so you're gonna import. There's that path

485
00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:48.929
Anthony Taylor: you're going to bring in your Tesla data from resources

486
00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:53.879
Anthony Taylor: kind of interesting. They had to do that. I don't think they've ever had to do that. I mean, we've done it. But

487
00:46:54.310 --> 00:47:03.910
Anthony Taylor: you're going to do a quick head on that. You're going to do an info. You're going to do a date conversion like we did in the instructor, one

488
00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:07.480
Anthony Taylor: ahead again and info again.

489
00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:11.100
Anthony Taylor: Make it Europe, Berlin time zone.

490
00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:16.269
Anthony Taylor: First 5 rows is ahead and an info. You're done.

491
00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:23.410
Anthony Taylor: That was kind of fast, right? But it really was like identical to what we just did.

492
00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:30.089
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna hit an error an error. When we hit use Pop, you're gonna get the warning. Yeah.

493
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:32.250
Anthony Taylor: okay, how'd you guys do?

494
00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:35.930
Anthony Taylor: Pretty okay?

495
00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:37.620
Mason, Natalie: Awesome.

496
00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:46.319
Anthony Taylor: I don't think anyone's gonna complain about the time on that one since I have people back in the breakout room like 9 min in.

497
00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.930
Anthony Taylor: So I'm thinking, everybody finish that one. Okay.

498
00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:53.590
Clayton Graves: it was literally all just functions. You're just calling a function.

499
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:57.190
Anthony Taylor: Pretty much. Everything in life is just functions.

500
00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:01.200
Anthony Taylor: Pretty much okay. Kind of.

501
00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:09.839
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So let's just quickly review it. though. You guys did it so fast, I doubt you really needed me to review it.

502
00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:12.039
Anthony Taylor: Just kidding. I'm still gonna review it.

503
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:15.609
Anthony Taylor: Okay, back to the top.

504
00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:27.739
Anthony Taylor: And so we brought in pandas. We brought in Tesla. We peeked at the head. We can see right away. There's going to be a problem.

505
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:36.739
Anthony Taylor: It's gonna need a time conversion. So we can do that. Notice. I didn't even put the in first schema in there on this one.

506
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:39.899
Anthony Taylor: okay, are in for format.

507
00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:44.499
Anthony Taylor: Don't even need it. But here's what it looks like. If you did.

508
00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:52.580
Anthony Taylor: okay? So you would do format equals. And it would the one that's up here.

509
00:48:52.820 --> 00:49:05.810
Anthony Taylor: This one is basically this format. You're probably like Yikes. But if you just go here, you can actually see and figure it out pretty quickly.

510
00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:08.280
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

511
00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:14.130
Anthony Taylor:  so yeah. So you build your format from these

512
00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:22.600
Anthony Taylor: abbreviation. So here's day a month. Here's month as a 0 added decimal number.

513
00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:25.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

514
00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:27.710
Weekday.

515
00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:33.550
Anthony Taylor: Weak number. Alright. Lots of fun stuff.

516
00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:45.569
Meredith McCanse (she/her): And the percentage in front usually means like, however, it usually tells it, like, however, many characters needed. Right? Is that true? That's just telling you it's a format.

517
00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:47.669
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Oh, okay, that's it.

518
00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:53.889
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, yeah. so, but yeah, so anyway, so this is what it would look like

519
00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:58.179
Anthony Taylor: today if you had to do your own format.

520
00:49:58.410 --> 00:50:06.809
Anthony Taylor: So you would basically just put it in here like this. But like, say, it had slashes instead of dashes. Okay, you would go

521
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:08.180
Anthony Taylor: slash.

522
00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:11.330
Anthony Taylor: flash.

523
00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:14.299
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Assuming it was that slash

524
00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:26.970
Anthony Taylor: alright. It's fairly straightforward, but it will take you some getting used to. Yeah. So you run that it does the same thing. Here's the infer date time where you get the warning.

525
00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:30.359
Anthony Taylor: I just did it all 3 ways. So you guys can see

526
00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:36.520
Anthony Taylor: you don't actually need it, because this one is actually in the format. Pandas expects it in.

527
00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:40.490
Anthony Taylor: So you don't actually need to say a format

528
00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:43.599
Anthony Taylor: but if you did, it would be this one.

529
00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:46.789
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. So enough on that

530
00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:49.650
Anthony Taylor: test the head. So now it's formatted.

531
00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:54.270
Anthony Taylor: Info! It is a date time, it is in Utc.

532
00:50:54.850 --> 00:51:04.480
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to change it to Europe. Berlin. do another hit. Do another info. and we can see it's still daytime, and now it's in Europe for them.

533
00:51:04.650 --> 00:51:06.390
Anthony Taylor: which is plus what else?

534
00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:12.840
Anthony Taylor: Pretty cool. Everyone nailed this. Huh? No issues.

535
00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:14.799
Anthony Taylor: Then let us continue.

536
00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:18.500
Anthony Taylor: let us continue

537
00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:30.540
Anthony Taylor: alright. analyzing market data. So we're going to start looking at patterns in our time series data?

538
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:43.500
Anthony Taylor:  I mean, everything in Ml is effectively atoms. Okay, when we deal with data like we'll deal with big data.

539
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:46.300
Anthony Taylor: the patterns might be really hard to find

540
00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:57.280
Anthony Taylor: as we start doing analytics on that data patterns start to emerge. And as we get to the point where we can make decisions on those patterns, they tend to be very well

541
00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:59.600
Anthony Taylor: or okay.

542
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:04.730
Anthony Taylor:  I mean, everything has a pattern.

543
00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:09.529
Anthony Taylor: whether you think about it or not. You getting ready for class today. There's a pattern

544
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:18.200
Anthony Taylor: you may call it a routine, but maybe that routine is not the same every day. But I bet you, if you looked at it over the entire 6 months, there's a pattern.

545
00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:26.080
Anthony Taylor: a pattern that's so solid that when this class is over you will still be doing it

546
00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:30.649
Anthony Taylor: and going. Dang it, I don't have class.

547
00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:38.659
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And again, you could say, that's routine. Well, yeah. alright. But So

548
00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:51.510
Anthony Taylor: lots of examples include going to lunch. Feeling excited about the market opening or closing, getting ready for class whatever. These are common interday patterns or time of day patterns.

549
00:52:52.210 --> 00:52:56.340
Anthony Taylor: stock market patterns, some examples of time series, stock market.

550
00:52:56.500 --> 00:53:00.220
Anthony Taylor: a surge in trading value. Open magazine, Easter.

551
00:53:01.690 --> 00:53:07.100
Anthony Taylor: A spike in training value when market closes its position at lunchtime

552
00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:12.289
Anthony Taylor: a daily, higher, low price that's tested around lunchtime

553
00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:28.760
Anthony Taylor: increases in trading value between 2 and 3 Eastern. a final push before the market closes just before 4 Easter. These are all patterns. Our job is to algorithmically identify these patterns. But first.

554
00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:32.950
Anthony Taylor: let's just visualize. Okay.

555
00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:35.000
yeah.

556
00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:37.729
Anthony Taylor: So let's go do that.

557
00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:48.820
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna bring in pandas again. We're gonna bring in our S and P, 500 data again.

558
00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:54.639
I'm gonna go ahead and infer the date time. Just get that converted. Now we need it.

559
00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:56.589
Anthony Taylor: We're going to put it into Easter.

560
00:53:57.660 --> 00:54:03.290
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then we're gonna take a look. We just did all of it in one cell. What we were doing in 3 or 4 a few minutes ago.

561
00:54:03.790 --> 00:54:09.050
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so now we have time, us Eastern, and it's a date time. We're good to go.

562
00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:20.340
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna go ahead and set our index to the time value. Why? Because we're gonna visualize. It's in the index. It pretty much automatically becomes the X axis.

563
00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:23.700
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So we don't have to sweat it.

564
00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:26.750
Anthony Taylor: Now.

565
00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:32.510
Anthony Taylor: here's a cool thing about indexing a date time object. You can

566
00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:36.310
Anthony Taylor: ask for different parts of the time

567
00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:40.689
Anthony Taylor: you can ask for year, month.

568
00:54:40.750 --> 00:54:54.180
Anthony Taylor: water. Sometimes you can ask for weeks. There's actually actually there you're going to see before the end of today. There is a defect they've changed this code.

569
00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:59.769
Anthony Taylor: and you can't ask for a certain one that we're gonna ask you to ask for.

570
00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:02.600
Anthony Taylor: And I'm going to try to get you guys to front it down.

571
00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:05.650
Anthony Taylor: But right now just understand

572
00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:08.340
Anthony Taylor: that you can see the year.

573
00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:18.510
Anthony Taylor: the month, and the quarter simply by putting dot index dot year, if it is, in fact, a date time object in the index.

574
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:21.020
Anthony Taylor: Why is this beneficial?

575
00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:28.670
Anthony Taylor: Well, if we want to chart? So right now, we're gonna so here, let's start this way. We're gonna chart that closing column.

576
00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:32.450
Anthony Taylor: And that's it, nothing else. And it looks like

577
00:55:32.770 --> 00:55:33.480
Anthony Taylor: that.

578
00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:41.960
Anthony Taylor: Okay, every single date value is represented. Every single up and down is represented. That looks like stock chart 10.

579
00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:47.550
Anthony Taylor: Who's my stock traders in here? I know Kevin is. But anybody else.

580
00:55:49.530 --> 00:55:53.910
Anthony Taylor: Oh, Mike, you okay. usually, what is this candlesticks? Right?

581
00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:59.699
Anthony Taylor: We clearly don't have an updated candlesticks. But yeah.

582
00:56:00.010 --> 00:56:15.780
Anthony Taylor: okay, so here we can look at. Or so, okay, so here, we're going to do a local. So we're gonna filter since our date time is the index. We don't have to put any words in here. We could just put the date we want to use and grab the first 20 records.

583
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:20.160
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we could see the first 20 records.

584
00:56:20.790 --> 00:56:22.680
Anthony Taylor: with 6, 6, 2, 19.

585
00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:25.200
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

586
00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:35.449
Anthony Taylor: we wanted to get between 6, 6, 2, 19, at 7, a. M. And 6, 6, 2, 19, at 9, 30. What are we trying to identify here, we're trying to get this dip, I think.

587
00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:37.410
Anthony Taylor: okay.

588
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:41.119
Anthony Taylor: we can do that with simply using

589
00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:47.370
Anthony Taylor: this range argument here. So now we have between

590
00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:50.019
Anthony Taylor: 7 and 9 30

591
00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:53.730
Anthony Taylor: cool. Okay.

592
00:56:54.040 --> 00:57:03.640
Anthony Taylor:  we can plot it same way. We're going to put the same loke. But then we're going to say we want it to plot the close column which down the other one

593
00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.490
Anthony Taylor: and plot it out.

594
00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:10.739
Anthony Taylor: So now we have a much smaller but much easier to read

595
00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:12.369
Anthony Taylor: period of time.

596
00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:15.920
Anthony Taylor: So clearly, we had a huge drop

597
00:57:16.410 --> 00:57:18.760
Anthony Taylor: right around 8.8

598
00:57:19.450 --> 00:57:21.320
Anthony Taylor: 8 15, most likely.

599
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:32.240
Meredith McCanse (she/her): But it's still. It's only within like it looks huge on the graph. But it's within a dollar, cause. It's $283 and 10 cents versus 90 cents.

600
00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:42.659
Anthony Taylor: I think we're just trying to come up with a how to drill down into chart. Yeah, it's not really that. This one's probably. What's this one like 2,

601
00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:44.460
Anthony Taylor: 90, something.

602
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:47.960
Anthony Taylor: the 2 70. That's a little more significant.

603
00:57:49.210 --> 00:57:51.869
Anthony Taylor: That's a lot longer range. So, but it's cool.

604
00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:59.970
Anthony Taylor:  So here we can look at 9, 30 to 9, 45 specifically. Oh, my God, that's about as tight as you get.

605
00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:08.189
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So that's like a 15 min period of time. I don't know that anybody would drill down that part.

606
00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:18.929
Anthony Taylor: and most widgets and stuff that you use allow you to drill down without doing this.  closing price during lunchtime. All right.

607
00:58:19.410 --> 00:58:23.060
Anthony Taylor: Know what I did there. So here, you can see between 11 and 12.

608
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:29.650
Anthony Taylor: Okay. here, you can see between 2 and 2, 45

609
00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:34.939
Anthony Taylor: started going back up. They're gonna get their dollar back.

610
00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:39.820
Anthony Taylor: Here, between 3, 30 and 4,

611
00:58:42.450 --> 00:58:46.019
Anthony Taylor: and here, between 3, 30 and 4 again, what?

612
00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:50.730
Anthony Taylor: Why are they doing that one twice? Oh, this is just showing the date. There you go.

613
00:58:51.970 --> 00:58:56.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay, when you see the data, it really doesn't look very impressive. Yay.

614
00:58:58.050 --> 00:58:59.060
Anthony Taylor: yes. Then

615
00:58:59.430 --> 00:59:01.699
sonja baro: I just want to confirm the

616
00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:13.609
Anthony Taylor: the thing we're showing repeatedly is using slicing of that data. Is that right? That's all we're really demonstrating. Here is basically this behavior.

617
00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:20.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this log which you guys have seen local before, but not on time, this one.

618
00:59:20.310 --> 00:59:24.359
Anthony Taylor: So we're basically just showing you like 15 different versions of

619
00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:27.400
Anthony Taylor: lessen the data down

620
00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:29.650
sonja baro: Gotcha.

621
00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:40.420
Meredith McCanse (she/her): and is the reason that you don't have to specify a column, because the time column is the index, and so it by default.

622
00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:49.090
Anthony Taylor: That is correct. If we wouldn't have done that, you would have had to do. Time equals every time or time in or whatever.

623
00:59:50.170 --> 00:59:56.579
Anthony Taylor: but for time, series, manipulation and time series visualization always set the time.

624
00:59:56.670 --> 01:00:01.179
Anthony Taylor: The the date time to begin will definitely make your life easier.

625
01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:03.270
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

626
01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:09.030
Anthony Taylor: I know you guys are like that was too easy. Once he once he got up his sleeve.

627
01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:12.669
Anthony Taylor: I have nothing up my sleeve

628
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:16.340
Anthony Taylor: they can't know. Okay, good.

629
01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:19.419
Anthony Taylor: Wait. What time is it?

630
01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:25.560
Anthony Taylor: There's no way. That's right.

631
01:00:28.110 --> 01:00:37.860
Anthony Taylor: So I would tell you guys deep my secret. Here's a secret. You guys know that we at Edx, we offer a data science course, which is what I taught

632
01:00:38.770 --> 01:00:42.320
Anthony Taylor: and then a Fintech course.

633
01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:44.660
Anthony Taylor: which is what Meredith wishes she with.

634
01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:49.220
Anthony Taylor: okay, so Fintech is a

635
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:54.979
Anthony Taylor: specialized field. It's pretty big field where it's all about

636
01:00:55.080 --> 01:01:05.700
Anthony Taylor: stuff like this. Will this module this week? Everything up until now has come from the daily science full? Okay, this one is actually from the Fintech port.

637
01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:08.200
Anthony Taylor: and I always said they had it to them.

638
01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:10.220
Anthony Taylor: That's what I said.

639
01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:18.459
Anthony Taylor: Okay, cause they're gonna give you 20 min to do. The next activity claims gonna be back 5 min, and I'm not even gonna have time.

640
01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:22.599
Anthony Taylor: Alright. But that's alright. Okay. So

641
01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:27.259
Anthony Taylor: I guess we can, you guys want to take a break before or after this activity

642
01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:29.930
Meredith McCanse (she/her): after

643
01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:36.170
Anthony Taylor: after. Okay, then I say, I say, good for you. Alright. So let's look at the activity real quick.

644
01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:38.350
Anthony Taylor: See what you guys have to do?

645
01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:44.839
Anthony Taylor: Well, it actually has a I suppose we should look at it.

646
01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:53.280
Anthony Taylor: Set the time column to the index plot, the closing price of Tia of Tesla. You're going to do a lobe where you zoom into 2020.

647
01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:56.300
Anthony Taylor: You're gonna zoom.

648
01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:12.390
Anthony Taylor: Let's see what that is. And then you're gonna do some other local. So let's go look at this, because I that looks like they're going to ask you to do something I didn't show. Well, I did not exactly

649
01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:19.280
Anthony Taylor: alright. So there's the hair they're giving you all this. Okay, here's where you convert it. They give you all of this.

650
01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:21.730
Anthony Taylor: Geez. Okay?

651
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:26.190
Anthony Taylor: So here they're going to have you set it to the index and then do ahead.

652
01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:33.790
Anthony Taylor: Here. You're going to plot close. You're going to do the whole plot. No filter. Okay?

653
01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:38.030
Anthony Taylor:  Then you're going to plot just 2020.

654
01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:47.299
Anthony Taylor: Then you're going to plot prices from 20 to 20 using date time. What?

655
01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:51.399
Anthony Taylor: Okay? I'm not positive. I know what that is. So 1 s

656
01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:55.809
Anthony Taylor: probably do. It's just the terminology, weird.

657
01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:00.070
Anthony Taylor: almost. There.

658
01:03:02.890 --> 01:03:05.360
Anthony Taylor: Oh, that's right. It's after break. Duh

659
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:12.760
Anthony Taylor:  Oh.

660
01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:15.119
Anthony Taylor: okay. So do you remember this part?

661
01:03:17.110 --> 01:03:21.179
Anthony Taylor: I'm kind of glad we went over this, because probably would have forgotten. Been met

662
01:03:25.590 --> 01:03:26.600
Anthony Taylor: right here.

663
01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:34.080
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so if I said. use the date time index

664
01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:36.210
Anthony Taylor: for year.

665
01:03:38.110 --> 01:03:39.360
Anthony Taylor: that's what I mean.

666
01:03:41.690 --> 01:03:45.559
Anthony Taylor: Is that clear? So if we go back to the exercise.

667
01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:51.820
Anthony Taylor: It says. using the date time index.

668
01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:56.820
Anthony Taylor: Now, we didn't technically do it. But it's basically this would be

669
01:03:57.490 --> 01:03:59.799
Anthony Taylor: you putting the column name

670
01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:05.779
Anthony Taylor: okay, with the index and equals equals the year you want to filter up.

671
01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:12.039
Anthony Taylor: So just as an example, I'm not going to give it to you all inside, but something like

672
01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:18.950
Anthony Taylor: dot log bracket, and then the column name, which is what EF. Underscore

673
01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:23.980
Anthony Taylor: Tesla. So you have to do the whole thing. Dot index

674
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.080
Anthony Taylor: dot you

675
01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:27.210
Anthony Taylor: okay.

676
01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:29.569
Anthony Taylor: equals equals 22.

677
01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:31.970
Anthony Taylor: Everybody understand?

678
01:04:32.250 --> 01:04:38.509
Anthony Taylor: That's what this means. The index attributes. We are going to use those again later. So be sure that you got that

679
01:04:39.110 --> 01:04:43.470
Anthony Taylor: and then here, go back to the other one that we were doing before.

680
01:04:43.590 --> 01:04:49.860
Anthony Taylor: You don't need to, you know, with the ranges like we did in the instructor. One same. Here, you're done

681
01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:53.229
Anthony Taylor: 1 min to knock this out

682
01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:59.550
alright, so we'll run through this and then take a break.

683
01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:03.930
Anthony Taylor: That was such a fun activity

684
01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:12.640
Clayton Graves: for me. Also, I have to tell you that Jennifer had a way more elegant solution than I used, and so we took some time to talk through that as well.

685
01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:17.109
sonja baro: That's great. That's how we learn. Good job.

686
01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:21.420
Anthony Taylor: Mike. Did you end the riot in the kitchen?

687
01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:29.260
michael mcpherson: Yeah, they were. They were making themselves ice cream Sunday, and of course

688
01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:32.660
michael mcpherson: everything else that everybody wanted right? This second.

689
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:38.150
michael mcpherson: So they had to discuss. Is it like 20 degrees out there 20°F out there right now.

690
01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:43.260
michael mcpherson: It's a 71 degrees 70 71 degrees in the house.

691
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:44.979
Anthony Taylor: Oh, well.

692
01:05:46.090 --> 01:05:48.000
Raugewitz, Tania: ice cream is always appropriate.

693
01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:52.730
michael mcpherson: No, no, my kids talking to each other to each other is the problem.

694
01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:58.889
michael mcpherson: That's always fair. Soon as one starts mo moving their mouth, the other one starts yelling.

695
01:05:59.430 --> 01:06:00.660
michael mcpherson: And there's 4 of them.

696
01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:14.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So we read in our test the data and we took a peek at it. and we got the info. I believe we got all this stuff. So we converted the column to date. Time

697
01:06:14.790 --> 01:06:29.569
Anthony Taylor: gave us that cool little warning to get it again doesn't look a whole lot different. But if we do the info, we can see it is, in fact, different. Now we're going to set the index. So now we can see, it's different in the data frame itself.

698
01:06:30.170 --> 01:06:31.390
Anthony Taylor: That's number one.

699
01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:36.049
Anthony Taylor: If we just plot on that, and that's it, because

700
01:06:36.070 --> 01:06:42.940
Anthony Taylor: we have it as the index. All we have to do is pass in the column, and it'll plot on that index, giving us this cool

701
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:44.830
Anthony Taylor: Tesla chart.

702
01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:47.730
Anthony Taylor: Clearly this must have been around the time he bought

703
01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:56.270
Anthony Taylor: Twitter. Now that was recent. Don't know. I don't know what that is up. Meredith. What happened to Tesla in 2,020?

704
01:06:57.570 --> 01:07:03.509
Meredith McCanse (she/her): That's a good question. I'm trying that. So that was like during the Covid lockdown. Right? Cause the lockdown started around March.

705
01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:10.629
Anthony Taylor: You know what? Yeah, maybe maybe just car sales probably drop that covid lock down on

706
01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:16.700
Meredith McCanse (she/her): cause it went up right. And what is this closing prices? Oh, I don't know why I actually I don't know.

707
01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:20.959
Anthony Taylor: I mean, that's look at that. He was over 2,000 and dropped down to

708
01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:34.050
sonja baro: as low as looks like 200 and some he was having battery issues.

709
01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:47.619
Masarirambi, Rodney: and nobody was able to go in and actually do the work cause like for like that year. And the next year, if you wanted any like any nonstock car option. They were building a spray from the factory so like a sunroof

710
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:51.540
Masarirambi, Rodney: you were getting it straight from the factory. Then there was like no stock for that.

711
01:07:52.730 --> 01:07:53.400
Anthony Taylor: Huh?

712
01:07:54.050 --> 01:07:55.559
Anthony Taylor: Clayton? What's question?

713
01:07:58.200 --> 01:07:59.280
Clayton Graves: Figs.

714
01:07:59.490 --> 01:08:05.940
Clayton Graves: how about how? How do we set things? Seriously? How do I calculate that? How do I determine what the correct.

715
01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:09.460
Clayton Graves: Yeah, honestly, if you let that off, what does it look like with?

716
01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:24.210
Anthony Taylor: It's just shorter. So it's really just it. It has to do with the I mean II wouldn't even worry about it, Frank, unless you just you know, you could try different sizes.

717
01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:29.629
Anthony Taylor:  I I'm positive it's not in choose

718
01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:34.839
Anthony Taylor: I saw on the web, on their documentation. It did say, inches.

719
01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:41.090
Anthony Taylor: Is that crazy, though? But this isn't 20, so if it is inches. Then it's cutting it off the screen.

720
01:08:41.670 --> 01:08:47.510
Anthony Taylor: So that that's why inches came into my head. I'm pretty sure. But that's clearly not 20 inches.

721
01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:52.149
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and that's clearly not 10 inches.

722
01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:54.500
Anthony Taylor: So I don't know.

723
01:08:54.529 --> 01:09:01.919
Anthony Taylor: But my opinion on fig size is it's just cosmetic, and what we do is not cosmetic, so don't worry about it

724
01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:04.510
Anthony Taylor: unless it helps make it easier to see.

725
01:09:05.370 --> 01:09:07.369
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're not. We're not

726
01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:08.950
Anthony Taylor: cosmetics.

727
01:09:11.569 --> 01:09:14.319
Anthony Taylor: only that. only that

728
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:18.540
Anthony Taylor: this is way easier than trying to slice it.

729
01:09:18.939 --> 01:09:22.529
Clayton Graves: Have you seen this face? Yes, I know we're not cosmetic.

730
01:09:24.279 --> 01:09:27.700
Anthony Taylor: Okay. continuing for.

731
01:09:27.979 --> 01:09:40.060
Anthony Taylor: So we did everything. Now, we're just gonna do 2020 again, because we use as an index. We could simply say 20, and we get only 2020.

732
01:09:40.770 --> 01:09:41.850
michael mcpherson: And coming

733
01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:48.960
Clayton Graves: now, when we get it, I specify close, and and it looks pretty much the same.

734
01:09:49.170 --> 01:09:53.920
Anthony Taylor: It will, it, will. There's only one value, so it it will, either.

735
01:09:55.380 --> 01:10:02.430
Anthony Taylor: So here's the one with the index attributes. I think I gave you guys this. But but the bottom line is is

736
01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:07.120
Anthony Taylor: is like, say, you wanted to do month. Okay.

737
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:12.050
Anthony Taylor: right? You can't. You wouldn't be able to use just index to do month.

738
01:10:12.450 --> 01:10:22.810
Anthony Taylor: So you needed. You would need to know how to do this, or if you wanted to do quarter. you could do that here. Okay. we're going to do more of this in in after break.

739
01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:25.960
Anthony Taylor: So here's the range ones. Oh, that's right. Now.

740
01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:29.980
Anthony Taylor: looks exactly the same, because it is exactly the same.

741
01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:39.789
Anthony Taylor: So here we're going to go from 28 to 2, 20 to 2029. So August to September. very cool. See that incredible drop.

742
01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:45.539
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then from 8, 22 to September fifth

743
01:10:47.530 --> 01:10:48.190
Anthony Taylor: oops.

744
01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:53.519
Anthony Taylor: And that's it. Alright. Any questions on any of that

745
01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:58.620
Anthony Taylor: fantastic alright. So

746
01:11:00.150 --> 01:11:05.440
Anthony Taylor: let's take our break. come back at 8,

747
01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:07.790
Anthony Taylor: 40,

748
01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:10.570
Anthony Taylor: 8, 40. I see it. 8, 40

749
01:11:10.670 --> 01:11:11.570
Anthony Taylor: hiking.

750
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.940
Anthony Taylor: So how did we do? Did we get Iso Calendar figured out.

751
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:26.179
Anthony Taylor: Did anybody not get it? I love that. You guys got it

752
01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:35.699
sonja baro: well, not everybody. We didn't get it. We got stuck on another little bump.

753
01:11:36.730 --> 01:11:38.370
Anthony Taylor: It doesn't work for what? But

754
01:11:39.190 --> 01:11:40.320
Clayton Graves: hours?

755
01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:42.970
Anthony Taylor: Oh, oh.

756
01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:44.080
Anthony Taylor: maybe.

757
01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:47.990
Anthony Taylor: Well, let's take a look. Let's go, and we'll start at the beginning.

758
01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:54.320
Anthony Taylor: When I push the solutions. By the way, I will push it with the Iso calendar solution. It's not in the original solution.

759
01:11:54.840 --> 01:12:05.349
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So we're gonna bring in the data. We're going to index column will be date our states. We're gonna do this. We know, that doesn't do anything anymore or does. But it's not gonna

760
01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:09.089
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna look at just the value data

761
01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:14.560
Anthony Taylor: and put it into this variable. We're going to do a group level at day of week

762
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:20.949
Anthony Taylor: and group by our new group level which is damp. You could have put that in here.

763
01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:24.350
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna get the mean and we're gonna plot it all at one pass

764
01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:27.310
Anthony Taylor: that comfortable, for everybody

765
01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:30.940
Anthony Taylor: was kind of a cotton one pass go

766
01:12:31.370 --> 01:12:38.549
Meredith McCanse (she/her): can you scroll up a little bit? So at this step. where you turned it into a variable.

767
01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:52.690
Meredith McCanse (she/her): We played with a couple of different ways to do that. This, I think, looks like it's the most simple, is there is there like we did it where we did Dotloc to filter it. And then we also figured out a version where we just we we

768
01:12:52.770 --> 01:12:57.529
Meredith McCanse (she/her): we isolated it, but turned it into a data frame so it wouldn't come out as a

769
01:12:57.610 --> 01:13:01.020
Meredith McCanse (she/her): as a series. But this is different. This is a.

770
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:03.940
Anthony Taylor: we wanted it to be a series in this case.

771
01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:08.099
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay, so like, is there like, is the version you did? Is this like

772
01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:14.249
Meredith McCanse (she/her): this would be the anytime it tells you to slice a column or to pull out a single column. Go ahead and just do it.

773
01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:17.680
Anthony Taylor: That. Yes, there's probably 10 ways you could do it.

774
01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:22.569
Anthony Taylor: But this is definitely what we always want you to do when we say just grab one call

775
01:13:24.430 --> 01:13:36.929
sonja baro: got it? We did not do that.

776
01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:38.749
Anthony Taylor: No, that I mean.

777
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:40.810
Anthony Taylor: that's not interesting. Approach

778
01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:44.510
Anthony Taylor: as long as you saved it to a new data frame, I would say, you're fine.

779
01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:46.860
sonja baro: What's your

780
01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:54.589
Anthony Taylor: well, and the only reason I'd say that is no one necessarily destroy it, because what if you wanted to get late, then you'd have to go and reload your old data.

781
01:13:54.650 --> 01:13:56.820
sonja baro: But if you made a new one

782
01:13:56.910 --> 01:14:01.079
Anthony Taylor: and drop that column that you'd still be okay. You'd still be in the same space.

783
01:14:01.210 --> 01:14:07.900
Anthony Taylor: Right? Okay, no, I honestly, that's not wrong at all. It's just

784
01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:16.700
Anthony Taylor: you would have to think ahead that am I going to need clothes later? If you know you're not gonna need it? Then that's actually a perfectly acceptable solution.

785
01:14:17.190 --> 01:14:18.040
sonja baro: Okay.

786
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:19.360
Anthony Taylor: okay?

787
01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:23.610
sonja baro: And then on the on the plot below.

788
01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:25.410
sonja baro: Yes.

789
01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:35.560
sonja baro: just why do we have more than 7 data points on the on the X access.

790
01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:41.649
Anthony Taylor: This is just a range. These are just ticks.

791
01:14:42.530 --> 01:14:47.550
Anthony Taylor: So the ticks don't. Necessarily, they don't necessarily line up to a data point.

792
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.290
sonja baro: So we have, however, many data points. So I mean, I see, like, this is what

793
01:14:52.650 --> 01:15:00.239
Anthony Taylor: this whole line to 3. I would guess there's 4, maybe 5 at the count first one

794
01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.550
sonja baro: which makes sense day a week. Right?

795
01:15:03.710 --> 01:15:15.890
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Okay, so that's we were kind of stuck on this because we were trying to figure out. We thought that was wrong, the 0 to

796
01:15:16.050 --> 01:15:17.329
sonja baro: thank you. Yeah.

797
01:15:17.610 --> 01:15:24.929
Anthony Taylor: no, you're good, hey? So then we can do hours same way as we did the one up above. And again, this could have been put here if if

798
01:15:25.150 --> 01:15:29.000
Anthony Taylor: we're putting it in a variable. But the rest of this is exactly the same.

799
01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:38.850
Anthony Taylor: Okay. In fact. if you look, since we use the same variable. the rest of the code is exactly the same. The only thing we changed is which group level we wanted.

800
01:15:39.470 --> 01:15:46.050
Anthony Taylor: So this is a good practice here. So here you can see the hours. Now, why doesn't it go? The whole range?

801
01:15:46.600 --> 01:16:01.470
Anthony Taylor: Because we probably only have from feet till 14. So 8 am. To 20'clock. Okay. now, here's the ugly. What if you would have tried to do this with index dot day of week.

802
01:16:01.930 --> 01:16:08.610
Anthony Taylor: which even shows up in the documentation which I brought in here for you. Okay.

803
01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:14.649
Anthony Taylor:  even if you do it with. According to the documentation. It's as well not with our version of bicycle.

804
01:16:15.150 --> 01:16:20.250
Anthony Taylor: So Iso Calendar. It's still column index.

805
01:16:20.370 --> 01:16:23.889
Anthony Taylor: But you do iso calendar, and then you do dot week.

806
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.789
Anthony Taylor: If you want to see all the options. you can actually Google this.

807
01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:34.840
Raugewitz, Tania: And where's that date? Time index?

808
01:16:35.770 --> 01:16:37.270
Raugewitz, Tania: Oh, that's permission.

809
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:40.520
Anthony Taylor: Sorry. Let me go back and go back. I'm not sure I heard.

810
01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:52.600
Raugewitz, Tania: So so this part no, no, down below is explaining.

811
01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:56.709
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, no. This is just the documentation of

812
01:16:57.150 --> 01:16:59.580
Anthony Taylor: this one. just to be clear.

813
01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:02.880
Anthony Taylor: It's for this one. And

814
01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:07.720
Anthony Taylor: and like, I said, some of these have been deprecated like day of week.

815
01:17:09.170 --> 01:17:13.180
Anthony Taylor: I did not put the documentation for this one. But like I showed you, it's pretty much just

816
01:17:14.850 --> 01:17:19.580
Anthony Taylor: if you come in here and look. you can see you know what kind of options.

817
01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:21.229
You have

818
01:17:21.730 --> 01:17:34.220
Anthony Taylor: okay. Well, it tells you about the function, I'm sure. Somewhere. therefore years always start. Weeks start with money, years start with money. 52. So this is an isocho. Okay. alright.

819
01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:37.359
Anthony Taylor: that's card trick. And look at that.

820
01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:45.029
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Can you, Anthony? Can you scroll up and show the code above this. Sure, of course, on the this part.

821
01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:47.350
Meredith McCanse (she/her): we definitely did not.

822
01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:55.469
Anthony Taylor: So did you? I mean, cause this is identical to the line above this. So it was it the group level that you struggled with?

823
01:17:56.130 --> 01:17:58.960
Meredith McCanse (she/her): We got it to work. We just did it differently.

824
01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:00.730
Meredith McCanse (she/her): We didn't

825
01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:02.110
Meredith McCanse (she/her): like. We didn't

826
01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:08.690
Meredith McCanse (she/her): like. You're sort of assigning. I think you're assigning a variable, and then you're calling the variable when you plot it.

827
01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:12.159
Meredith McCanse (she/her): And we did. Yeah, here's the same thing.

828
01:18:17.050 --> 01:18:17.920
Anthony Taylor: same thing.

829
01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:21.560
Anthony Taylor: We only did. The only reason they did this

830
01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:32.590
Anthony Taylor: was because up here this code and this code are identical except for the way we broke it up.

831
01:18:34.270 --> 01:18:38.610
Anthony Taylor: That's the only reason they did that. So you could see how we could reuse the same code.

832
01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:41.300
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay.

833
01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:44.610
Meredith McCanse (she/her): does that help you? Yeah. Yup.

834
01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:51.629
Anthony Taylor: anybody else have a question.

835
01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:55.530
Anthony Taylor: Nay.

836
01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:58.500
Anthony Taylor: alright, well.

837
01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:03.190
Anthony Taylor: don't look at that. Okay.

838
01:19:04.210 --> 01:19:07.190
Anthony Taylor: we did questions recap.

839
01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:15.790
Anthony Taylor: recognize the importance of time data. I think we beat that up pretty good today. Time data has a lot to do with a lot of things.

840
01:19:16.290 --> 01:19:30.060
Anthony Taylor: Okay, manipulate it. We definitely were able to do that.  you know, manipulate, like, we basically were able to take some date time data and turn it into weeks, days, months, quarters.

841
01:19:30.170 --> 01:19:31.969
Anthony Taylor: all kinds of fun stuff.

842
01:19:32.370 --> 01:19:37.009
Anthony Taylor: We did some data analysis techniques with our date time data.

843
01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:44.789
Anthony Taylor: We identified some cool patterns in stock market, did some slicing with our loaf as well as our indexes.

844
01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:46.210
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

845
01:19:46.590 --> 01:19:48.420
Anthony Taylor: and that's it.

846
01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:50.109
Anthony Taylor: I mean, that was today.

847
01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:55.340
Anthony Taylor: So next lesson you're going to learn about correlations. Yes, we're going to talk about correlations again.

848
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:58.400
Anthony Taylor: however. and this one

849
01:19:59.930 --> 01:20:04.570
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna get a little more specific to how we're going to use them

850
01:20:05.490 --> 01:20:07.520
Anthony Taylor: or time series

851
01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:14.480
Anthony Taylor: data. Okay, we saw a pretty interesting correlation today. And I will tell you it will be in

852
01:20:14.490 --> 01:20:22.050
Anthony Taylor: one of the demonstrations. But does anybody remember what correlation we saw today? That was really obvious.

853
01:20:24.810 --> 01:20:33.130
sonja baro: I can give you a big inventory at home price

854
01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:38.999
Anthony Taylor: inventory and home price, right? Obvious correlation. And we would make sense without even seeing.

855
01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:59.019
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But that's one of the Demos that you're gonna see is a correlation between those 2 values. Okay? So we're going to cover that  yeah. And then we're gonna start doing some forecasting. We're gonna use a new tool if you guys feel free to check it out.

856
01:20:59.050 --> 01:21:01.390
Anthony Taylor: It's called Google Colab.

857
01:21:03.630 --> 01:21:06.259
Anthony Taylor: If you just type Google prolab.

858
01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:09.860
Anthony Taylor: it'll take you to it.

859
01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:18.580
Anthony Taylor: You will need a Google account if you don't have one. Okay, and preferably at Google Drive. But have a Google account to have a Google drive.

860
01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:22.239
Anthony Taylor: All right. I will ask you this question right now.

861
01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:27.050
Anthony Taylor: Oh, I'm not saying it

862
01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:30.100
really

863
01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:33.029
know this one.

864
01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:35.719
Anthony Taylor: I don't need to. I don't need to look this one up

865
01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:45.430
Anthony Taylor: so, as you can see, you need a Google account. But

866
01:21:45.550 --> 01:21:47.109
Anthony Taylor: what does that look like to you?

867
01:21:49.010 --> 01:22:00.300
Anthony Taylor: It's just a plain old notebook. The only difference between this notebook and the notebook on your computer is this, one is using Google's cloud hardware.

868
01:22:01.570 --> 01:22:05.720
Anthony Taylor: which allows us to do some things that your computers won't be capable of.

869
01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:10.980
Anthony Taylor: Alright, we will be using this quite a bit throughout this course.

870
01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:19.479
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so feel free. Google, it, check it out, create a new notebook. If you can get here all you need for tomorrow.

871
01:22:20.930 --> 01:22:31.810
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Google Colab. we are going to actually take a few minutes to do this in class, so don't get too concerned. But you can do it. You'll be that far ahead. Hi.

872
01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:34.559
Anthony Taylor: guys, wonderful class. Today.

873
01:22:34.930 --> 01:22:37.160
Anthony Taylor: I like all that extra time.

874
01:22:37.530 --> 01:22:41.590
Anthony Taylor:  have a great Wednesday night.

875
01:22:41.630 --> 01:22:43.829
Anthony Taylor: I will see you tomorrow.

876
01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:46.130
Anthony Taylor: Poop.
