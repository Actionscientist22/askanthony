00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.549
Anthony Taylor: But one of the funnier jokes with Chat TPT. In the beginning it was a comic strip.

2
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.480
Anthony Taylor: and and it was

3
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:22.769
Anthony Taylor: somebody talking about, you know, to the developer who was using it. This is, you're stealing other people's code. And he's like.

4
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.470
Anthony Taylor: yeah, but that's what we do.

5
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.909
Anthony Taylor: That's all we do.

6
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.459
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And it's true. There is a lot of truth to that. There's the reason Stack Overflow and and Github.

7
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.320
Anthony Taylor: and Kaggle and other places where people upload projects.

8
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.549
Anthony Taylor: I mean, they're as popular as they are, because

9
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:55.579
Anthony Taylor: that's a place to go see how other people did stuff. Now, might you change it? Might you make it more efficient? Might you

10
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.160
Anthony Taylor: come up with other ways just based on how they did it?

11
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.849
Anthony Taylor: Yes, you will.

12
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.590
Anthony Taylor: And maybe that.

13
00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.640
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Eventually, you'd be surprised how much you know, Clayton. I know I am.

14
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Let's get this. Let's get this party started.

15
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.199
Anthony Taylor: So today's an interesting day.

16
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:33.450
Anthony Taylor: I don't know if I have anything else to say about that. It's pretty much an interesting day. I did want to address the

17
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:41.339
Anthony Taylor: the the weekly feedback this week. Right? I want everybody know weekly feedback. By the way.

18
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.499
Anthony Taylor: it comes to me. Alright, it's not. Somebody gives it to me and says, Hey, maybe look at this. No like

19
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.810
Anthony Taylor: there are other people that look at it.

20
00:01:51.080 --> 00:02:03.629
Anthony Taylor:  and I appreciate all the feedback. Please keep it coming. It's awesome. So yeah, that's pretty much all I got to say about that. But I wanted to say some cause. I happen to look at it, too.

21
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.470
Anthony Taylor: I try to look at it at least once a week.

22
00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:13.249
Anthony Taylor: anyway. So what are we gonna do today?

23
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.859
Anthony Taylor: We're going to define bias and variance. We're going to describe the need for this. We're not going to. But

24
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.660
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna show you this.

25
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.270
Anthony Taylor: Never in my life, if I see anybody bothered with this. But that's okay.

26
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:35.859
Anthony Taylor: all right, I will show it to you. It'll be interesting. You could promptly forget it. Select features for models using P values. This will be interesting.

27
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:44.629
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're gonna talk about statistically significant sounds like a big word. And it is 2 big words.

28
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.279
Anthony Taylor: We're also going to talk about hypothesis.

29
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.130
Anthony Taylor: hypotheses

30
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.270
Anthony Taylor: the plural of hypothesis. hypothesis.

31
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.190
Clayton Graves: I apologize.

32
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.900
Clayton Graves: Hypothesis.

33
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.040
Anthony Taylor: Body? Oh.

34
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.909
Anthony Taylor: anyway, we're gonna cover that talk about multicollinearity.

35
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.740
Anthony Taylor: Sounds like, you know, really complicated.

36
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.779
Anthony Taylor: It's not the way I explain it to you. We are going to address it with python code.

37
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.689
Anthony Taylor: We're going to define regularization again. Sounds like that's going to be complicated, not.

38
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.099
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to apply it with 2 other

39
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:28.780
Anthony Taylor: amounts.

40
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:36.170
Anthony Taylor: Alright, it's really quite a bit of stuff today. I wouldn't be surprised if we get through it really quick

41
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.720
Anthony Taylor: bias.

42
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.540
Anthony Taylor: What is bias?

43
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.129
Clayton Graves: It's when the results of an inquiry are skewed towards

44
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.420
Clayton Graves: a specific direction

45
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:58.879
Clayton Graves: like clay. That's pretty damn good. I totally expected you guys to go down the PC route?

46
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.290
Anthony Taylor: No.

47
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:09.300
michael mcpherson: it's where you look for data to prove your point and ignore others. It dispersed. No, that's called data analytic.

48
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.800
Anthony Taylor: Oh.

49
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.960
Anthony Taylor: but

50
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.690
Anthony Taylor: okay, so biden

51
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:28.520
Anthony Taylor:  we you'll hear. Well, we're gonna have a whole week of data ethics somehow. And we'll talk about bias

52
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.469
Anthony Taylor: in the other term

53
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.330
Anthony Taylor: in this particular term. What we're referring to is well

54
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.670
Anthony Taylor: is to explain that the model is

55
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:50.410
Anthony Taylor: bias towards a specific something. In this case, a linear interpretation because it's a linear. Okay.

56
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.650
Anthony Taylor:  there's.

57
00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:08.319
Anthony Taylor: it's the difference between the actual values of a data set and the predictions made by the machine learning model. Okay, so how do we check for this kind of stuff? It's just an average of the errors between.

58
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.820
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

59
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:26.979
Anthony Taylor: So like, in this particular case each point along the X axis predictions made along that Y axis. So we have the Y, we're we're predicting what the Y value will be based on the X, and you can see here, we're going to predict, like right here. But the actual value is failed here.

60
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.440
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

61
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:37.819
Anthony Taylor:  So the error for each point is the difference between the value predicted by the model and the actual

62
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.850
Anthony Taylor: value. So this line here is the error.

63
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.410
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

64
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.839
Anthony Taylor:  so that's what that is so, what would a model look like with 0 bias

65
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.310
Anthony Taylor: like that?

66
00:05:51.840 --> 00:06:03.650
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, this is the reason I kind of glossed over this and jumped to that. Okay, this to me, explains bias way better. No bias. Every dot

67
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.170
Anthony Taylor: is accounted for.

68
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.499
Anthony Taylor: This is an overfit scenario.

69
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.339
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we've trained our model and it gets it right. A 100% of the time.

70
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.790
Anthony Taylor: Okay. it won't be able to generalize very well.

71
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.430
Anthony Taylor: Another predictive accuracy is variance. So with variance.

72
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.000
Anthony Taylor: we're looking at. like basically

73
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.760
Anthony Taylor: the opposites of bias.

74
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.060
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So

75
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.980
Anthony Taylor: in these 2 cases here that

76
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:44.570
Anthony Taylor: this line does a decent job. Okay of

77
00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:51.359
Anthony Taylor: handling this prediction, it's decent. It's not great. This line, not very good at all.

78
00:06:52.100 --> 00:07:03.500
Anthony Taylor: But part of the problem is, is the variance of this is just great. The variance of the data itself is just way out there. It's just not a good candidate for a linear model.

79
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.549
Anthony Taylor: You could use linear. It's just not going to be very good.

80
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:09.580
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

81
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.839
Anthony Taylor: so what we typically want

82
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.070
Anthony Taylor: is kind of somewhere in the middle. I

83
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:29.619
Anthony Taylor:  we want to moderate the amount of bias involved. But we also don't want too much variance. So if the data points look like this.

84
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.190
Anthony Taylor: okay.

85
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:36.459
Anthony Taylor: we want more of something that's going to generalize this data

86
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.340
Anthony Taylor: ironically.

87
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:46.769
Anthony Taylor: this exact. Now note, this is the prediction. So this yellow line is the actual model we train.

88
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:56.049
Anthony Taylor: This is new data. not the same data. Right? Everybody agree. we can apply this model to this. And actually, it's not bad.

89
00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:00.329
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's not terrible.

90
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:06.750
Anthony Taylor: because it's somewhere in the middle. Now, here's the problem. This model could be way better.

91
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:14.150
Anthony Taylor: If we had a little more generalization, this model would have probably sailed right at all of these stocks.

92
00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.949
Anthony Taylor: and we would get a better accuracy out.

93
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.060
Anthony Taylor:  so

94
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.590
Anthony Taylor: variance.

95
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.820
Anthony Taylor:  we want to control both bottom line.

96
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:35.649
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we don't want too much of either. And they like this this diagram, and it's pretty good. Okay, if you have a high bite.

97
00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.820
Anthony Taylor: and the bull's eye is what you're predicting. Alright.

98
00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:45.729
Anthony Taylor: you're biased if you're low variance high bias, like, every point's going to be exactly what you predict.

99
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.650
Anthony Taylor: Okay. high variance, high bias.

100
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:55.040
Anthony Taylor: Notice, we're kind of all over the place, but we're pretty close together

101
00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:04.979
Anthony Taylor: low bias, low variance. So now we have very low variance, but we're kind of off center off the mark

102
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.280
Anthony Taylor: alright, and then

103
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:19.370
Anthony Taylor: high, high or low, high would be. Not only are we off the mark, but we're like all over the. So you can see why this is not ideal, and this may look ideal. But it's not ideal either.

104
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:22.550
Anthony Taylor: We need basically the line in between. All

105
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:29.309
Clayton Graves: we'll get there. So is is is that invariants

106
00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:30.960
Clayton Graves: kind of like

107
00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:42.300
Clayton Graves: like a scope

108
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:45.050
Clayton Graves: like adjusting. Yeah, at the range.

109
00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:55.609
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I mean, especially with this bullseye one, right? But yeah, I mean, if you've got your scope dead on well, no, because this would be a perfect

110
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.460
Anthony Taylor: aligned scope. Right? Your scope would be perfect.

111
00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:09.769
Anthony Taylor: Right? This may not be. This might be, it's perfect. So, for it's a little, you know, it's shooting high or whatever. I don't know. Gun talk. But point is is no, because this is not ideal.

112
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.430
Anthony Taylor: This would be ideal if you were using good

113
00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:23.069
Anthony Taylor: right? But it's not actually ideal, because it's not generalizable. It doesn't give us the ability to add new dots that aren't these dots and get it right.

114
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:34.250
Anthony Taylor: It might, but it won't be perfect. It won't be as good as it could be. Go with that. So here's the big thing with biased variants. It's really a trade off. We want

115
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:39.250
Anthony Taylor: the the ideal. I mean, according to this, this diagram.

116
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.879
Anthony Taylor: okay, the ideal is somewhere in here, not necessarily at the intersection.

117
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.099
Anthony Taylor: but it's where

118
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:52.650
Anthony Taylor: it's it's right where variance and bias more or less start to rise.

119
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.189
Anthony Taylor: Do you see how it's doing that got it.

120
00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:00.769
Anthony Taylor: That kind of that arc. It's like almost the center of the arc, but not quite.

121
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:05.319
Anthony Taylor: But the bottom line is is we want to get it

122
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.910
Anthony Taylor: so that we're in the center of the total error.

123
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.770
Anthony Taylor: But

124
00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:16.600
Anthony Taylor: when you have higher bias you'll have lower variance. When you have higher variance, you'll have lower bias.

125
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:21.290
Anthony Taylor: That's the lesson you need to understand from all of this. Okay.

126
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:24.139
Anthony Taylor: so one more time, make sure I'm not.

127
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:28.280
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So one more time bias.

128
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.600
Anthony Taylor: Everything's too close together.

129
00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.410
Anthony Taylor: or we are.

130
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:38.410
Anthony Taylor: if you're looking at the bull's eyes. But if you're looking at the prediction. the prediction is like dead on.

131
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:42.850
Anthony Taylor: it's like hitting every single point, or nearly every single point.

132
00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:49.810
Anthony Taylor: while invariance, the points would be more spread out. The prediction tends to be off in the other direction.

133
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:52.060
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

134
00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:56.559
Anthony Taylor: So when it comes to machine learning, this is what

135
00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.130
Anthony Taylor: we're talking about

136
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:03.280
Anthony Taylor: underfitting. So in this particular case, the it's just too simple.

137
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:10.819
Anthony Taylor: Our model is not smart enough to see that the data is actually kind of doing this like, Nike scooch here.

138
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.800
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so while it might give us some accurate results.

139
00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:21.630
Anthony Taylor: you know. And this side of this of the data points, we're going to get horrible results.

140
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.200
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this side. Not very good, either.

141
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:31.899
Anthony Taylor: And even this down here isn't consistent, because while we look good right here, you know, right here things start to to shift.

142
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:41.870
Anthony Taylor: If we're overfitting, then the line like I said. It's not necessarily following every point, but it's hitting way too many dead off.

143
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:45.410
Anthony Taylor: You guys see how this is overfitting.

144
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:51.990
Clayton Graves: This is something we're going to avoid. Can you explain to me again why

145
00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:56.739
Clayton Graves: your model hitting each point get on is a bad thing.

146
00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:07.549
Anthony Taylor: So it goes back to generalization. Okay, so our generalized. So here's the thing. If I have, let's just do something really simple. We have

147
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.609
Anthony Taylor: 5 data points than they're describing a 10 issue.

148
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.599
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so how many different

149
00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.749
Anthony Taylor: variations could 5 data points yield?

150
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.029
Anthony Taylor: Right? 5 to the fifth power?

151
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.530
Anthony Taylor: So there's 25 variations.

152
00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:29.060
Anthony Taylor: I know all 25 of

153
00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:41.359
Anthony Taylor: because you gave me the data to train with. So if you give me, I have a red shoe with spikes, and it's got a swoosh, and it's this, I can tell you exactly what shoe it is every single time.

154
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:42.610
Anthony Taylor: Now.

155
00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:47.629
Anthony Taylor: that's how we trained our mom. Now we put our model in production.

156
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:53.670
Anthony Taylor: and then James comes up with doggone striped converse

157
00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.960
Anthony Taylor: that we didn't have in our regional 25.

158
00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:02.800
Anthony Taylor: Okay, because of that, our model will fail miserably.

159
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:08.260
Anthony Taylor: It'll be like no idea what this is. I don't even know if it's a shoe.

160
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:19.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Because we've told it. We've trained it, and it's only been trained on a limited set of data, or in this case it's been trained so well that it has no idea how to generalize

161
00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.270
Anthony Taylor: or and just say, Well.

162
00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:23.349
Anthony Taylor: I know it's a shoe.

163
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:27.780
Anthony Taylor: but it couldn't even do that. If it's over fit.

164
00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:32.299
Anthony Taylor: If it's under fit. we kind of go the other direction.

165
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:38.820
Anthony Taylor: I'll be right with you side where we would say. Hey, we didn't train this model enough.

166
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:45.800
Anthony Taylor: And I'm putting in a glove

167
00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:50.120
Anthony Taylor: into the model to predict. And it thinks it's a shoe.

168
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:58.420
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Cause we didn't train it enough to be able to even tell the difference between a model and a shoe or a glove and a shoe.

169
00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:07.340
Anthony Taylor: So you'll see more of this as we go deeper. But when you train and and good, the thunderous is overfitting is pretty easy to speak.

170
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:13.749
Anthony Taylor: Okay, what'll happen is you'll train it. Your training score will be very high.

171
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.180
Anthony Taylor: and your testing score will usually be pretty low

172
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:22.419
Anthony Taylor: or much lower. So like, if you have a training score of like 98,

173
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:30.250
Anthony Taylor: and a testing score of like 80, then you probably overfit your data because it's not generalizing well, under testing.

174
00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:37.030
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So so, and this is a big deal, I'm gonna tell you right now, overfitting will kill you

175
00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:42.500
Anthony Taylor: if you're doing this at work. Okay, you do not ever want to overfit. There is never a good time to over

176
00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:45.559
Anthony Taylor: underfit is better than overfit.

177
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:50.070
Anthony Taylor: but the right thing to do is try to get that balance like you see here.

178
00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:55.580
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And you guys understand why this balance, this line is more or less

179
00:15:56.510 --> 00:16:01.179
Anthony Taylor: as equidistant from the points around it all the way up.

180
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:04.380
Anthony Taylor: That's that's what you're shooting for.

181
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:09.659
Anthony Taylor: Alright. You won't even see this. You're gonna have to do this quantitatively. But still.

182
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:11.200
Anthony Taylor: okay.

183
00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:14.820
Anthony Taylor: alright, did. Sonya had a question. Yes, ma'am.

184
00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:32.349
sonja baro: yeah. And and I think so. It's going back to. We're in supervised learning right where we know the well we're doing regression. But yes, yes, okay. And so so I get that, Sonia, let me interrupt you. This is also applies to supervised

185
00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:36.379
sonja baro: applies to every

186
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.820
Anthony Taylor: this one all in up.

187
00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:41.080
sonja baro: So that's where I was

188
00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:46.730
sonja baro: like wondering, because if this is about a prediction

189
00:16:46.760 --> 00:17:00.940
sonja baro: based off of those features that we've trained it on, if we over fit it. It can't handle anything that it's not been trained on to show it doesn't know what to do with it. And we're

190
00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:18.319
sonja baro: yeah. And so, my, I just kind of spinning on. Well, then, how do you? So you and I guess maybe that's the answer is, you need it to not be so tight in order to then be useful for the unsupervised or supervised learning.

191
00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:25.130
sonja baro: So anything because, like, I said, we're gonna pass in somebody's gonna pass in something that doesn't fit into those 25

192
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.220
Anthony Taylor: sneakers.

193
00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:29.429
sonja baro: And we want our model to be smart enough to

194
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.999
sonja baro: do something with that. Okay? I mean, it could just return. I don't want it.

195
00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.230
Anthony Taylor: but that's not our useful model.

196
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:40.580
sonja baro: Because then your model basically can only identify 25 C,

197
00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:45.989
Clayton Graves: so the way the way I digest that it is. If it's if it's over fit.

198
00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:52.639
Clayton Graves: then your model's too narrow minded. and it won't like that new data.

199
00:17:52.910 --> 00:18:01.439
Clayton Graves:  and if it's under fit. Then it's way too open and usually distracted by anything. So

200
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.269
Clayton Graves: that that's how I took it.

201
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.590
Anthony Taylor: I like it. I like it.

202
00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:06.960
Anthony Taylor: That's good.

203
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.029
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So any other questions about this visual?

204
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:14.460
Anthony Taylor: Aye, cool. So

205
00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:21.639
Anthony Taylor: all of this stuff we we we test for when we do validation

206
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:31.880
Anthony Taylor: alright, and how do we do? Validation thus far. Well, we've learned recently of train test split, which will do all through regression all through

207
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:36.890
Anthony Taylor: class supervise and even into deep learning.

208
00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:48.220
Anthony Taylor: And the way we're going to do it is we're going to say, Hey, we're training on this data. Now, we need to test on this table. Okay? And we talked about that. But

209
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:49.900
Anthony Taylor: just as a quick reminder.

210
00:18:50.200 --> 00:19:01.490
Anthony Taylor: we take 70% of our data, we train our model comes up with a prediction. And then we take the testing data, take away the answer and then say, Okay.

211
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:06.850
Anthony Taylor: predict this. And then we compare the real answer with the predicted answer.

212
00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.310
Anthony Taylor: And that's how we score our model.

213
00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:14.069
Anthony Taylor: And you can see here as an example.

214
00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:20.790
Anthony Taylor: this particular model. It's like dead on for the training data. But look how far off. It is for testing data.

215
00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:24.230
Anthony Taylor: It didn't get a single one of them. Right?

216
00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:30.839
Anthony Taylor: You see that? Which means it's over fit.

217
00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:33.320
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

218
00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:41.409
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So anyway. how do we deal with this? So here's the big thing. So how do we reduce

219
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:47.190
Anthony Taylor: fights? Well. remember, I mentioned the 5 columns.

220
00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:51.669
Anthony Taylor: If you have 5 columns in your training data set. You don't have enough data.

221
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:57.280
Anthony Taylor: pretty much. Okay, there are ways to work with it. But

222
00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.630
Anthony Taylor: typically 5 features is not enough.

223
00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:02.530
Anthony Taylor: You need enough

224
00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:07.560
Anthony Taylor: features to to come up with a pattern that can be generalized.

225
00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:11.390
Anthony Taylor: 5 features, as we pointed out. That's 25 possibilities.

226
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.349
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's just not enough.

227
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:20.690
Anthony Taylor:  you can try limiting the complexity of the model. Well, what does that?

228
00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:21.790
Anthony Taylor: Well.

229
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:27.519
Anthony Taylor: in linear regression, the first linear regression we learned. How many features did it have?

230
00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:43.310
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, right? That's the simplest model you can make. So multilinear model multilinear regression. You could try that you could try other models that are simple.

231
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:47.180
Anthony Taylor:  sometimes, that'll work.

232
00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:48.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

233
00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:58.249
Anthony Taylor: choose a different algorithm. Well, that goes back to linear regression versus logistic regression versus random forest. All things you guys are going to learn.

234
00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:04.320
Anthony Taylor: Use ensemble. We haven't even talked about ensemble. But I will tell you what it is.

235
00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:09.310
Anthony Taylor: Anybody know. I know Jennifer, does anybody else know.

236
00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:13.790
Anthony Taylor: Come, I would guess. What's an ensemble? Anybody inquire

237
00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.630
Masarirambi, Rodney: bunch of different other tests that you've done.

238
00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:19.380
Anthony Taylor: Well, Ronnie nailed it.

239
00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:24.870
Anthony Taylor: He wasn't doing his choir version. But yeah, it's basically taking a number of models

240
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:34.789
Anthony Taylor: and comparing the results and coming up with a conclusion based on a number of models. I will tell you guys, very interesting thing I did at work the other day.

241
00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:40.450
Anthony Taylor:  the prophet, when we taught you guys

242
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.329
Anthony Taylor: is is unfortunately

243
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:47.410
Anthony Taylor:  It has a bad reputation.

244
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:50.689
Anthony Taylor: So no one's using it anymore in business.

245
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:57.129
Anthony Taylor:  but yeah, but it does. A nice visual on forecasting.

246
00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:58.520
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

247
00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:03.570
Anthony Taylor: a better way to do forecasting is F.

248
00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:23.120
Anthony Taylor: Multi model forecast. What does it do? Well, basically, you pass in like 5 or 6 forecasting models. it runs, all of them, and then comes up with

249
00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.670
Anthony Taylor: what it thinks will be the right forecast.

250
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:34.119
Anthony Taylor: So it runs. Multiple models, comes back, says, Oh, look! They all are more or less in this area. Let's make it that.

251
00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:40.889
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And it will do that for the whole 4. And it's far more

252
00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:47.360
Anthony Taylor: accurate and depending on how much horsepower you want to give it. You can give it 20 models.

253
00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:50.690
Anthony Taylor: and it'll do it with 20 months.

254
00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:54.200
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Everybody understand that

255
00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.550
Anthony Taylor: multi-

256
00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.750
Anthony Taylor: model forecasting.

257
00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:03.449
Anthony Taylor: F. Okay. And then last. You can scale the data.

258
00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:10.859
Anthony Taylor:  that doesn't always work by itself. But all of these things together will work

259
00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:12.440
Anthony Taylor: almost guaranteed.

260
00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:16.569
Anthony Taylor: But but not always can we get more data?

261
00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:22.139
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Sometimes we're already on the simplest model that'll work

262
00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:24.930
Anthony Taylor: core algorithm.

263
00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:31.529
Anthony Taylor: alright ensemble works. But there's not always a lot of different models to choose from.

264
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:36.090
Anthony Taylor: So it's something that we have to. Always.

265
00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:41.270
Anthony Taylor: I'm not gonna say we always watch out for this, but it's something we have to watch out for

266
00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:48.529
Anthony Taylor: okay. variants. Now, this is a big one. Add more training data.

267
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:59.000
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if we add more training data, we will get a better trained model. So here we don't have enough data.

268
00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:09.310
Anthony Taylor: all right, and it's guessing everything perfect, or it's managed to get it perfect here. We don't have enough data, and there's not enough data to train anything.

269
00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:14.399
Anthony Taylor: Basically, it doesn't see a pattern because there's not enough data

270
00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.859
Anthony Taylor: so it can't create an accurate outlook.

271
00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:24.479
Anthony Taylor:  if you don't validate your bottle before deploying. Pretend like you don't know.

272
00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:25.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

273
00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:27.900
Anthony Taylor: alright.

274
00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.310
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna warn you guys right now.

275
00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:39.830
Anthony Taylor: I'm hearing thunder and lightning again earlier today

276
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:47.970
Anthony Taylor: I had a quick blip on the power outage. If that happens. tas just put them in the first activity.

277
00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:52.440
Anthony Taylor: and hopefully they'll be able to do it. Alright.

278
00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:57.040
Anthony Taylor: James. Okay.

279
00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:01.669
Anthony Taylor: okay, good. Alright. It shouldn't happen.

280
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:07.300
Anthony Taylor: But we've been getting storms like every day this week, so

281
00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:10.929
Anthony Taylor: I've only had one blip. I have not had full outage yet.

282
00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:14.200
Anthony Taylor: Anyway. So

283
00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:19.350
Anthony Taylor: removing features that are overvalued. Now this goes back to

284
00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:28.449
Anthony Taylor: some of the things we've talked about, where, if you don't scale and standardize your data, you can have features that become

285
00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:30.300
Anthony Taylor: overly important.

286
00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:36.870
Anthony Taylor:  yeah. So we don't necessarily want

287
00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:46.390
Anthony Taylor: okay, and then retrain the model regularly while it's used in production. This is something

288
00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:53.160
Anthony Taylor: that, as far as I'm concerned, should just be a given almost like, remember to validate.

289
00:25:53.480 --> 00:26:07.009
Anthony Taylor: But when you create a model. And like, and and I have had some that were too big to do this regularly, though there are techniques to incrementally train a model which which I've implemented.

290
00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:12.329
Anthony Taylor: But say, yeah, the model takes like 4 h to retrain.

291
00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:18.740
Anthony Taylor:  if it's important model, you should probably retrain it once a week.

292
00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:25.729
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if it's not terribly important. Once a month, it's probably fine.

293
00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:34.770
Anthony Taylor: If the data changes a lot like you're getting. you know, a million new rows a day.

294
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:37.440
Anthony Taylor: Okay, retrain it often

295
00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:45.259
Anthony Taylor: because the model might adjust to a pattern that you didn't see before you got that new date.

296
00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.550
Anthony Taylor: Okay. yes, sir.

297
00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:53.140
sonja baro: So just on that concept of retraining the model. Yeah.

298
00:26:53.370 --> 00:27:03.559
sonja baro: does that mean? What if you only have a set amount of data like earlier? We talked about with the train test split how we'd take that data. Use it right?

299
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:06.990
sonja baro: And let's say, that's all the data you get.

300
00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:22.839
Anthony Taylor: Then there's no reason to retrain. Then you wouldn't retrain. So retraining is really also. For as you get new data or most machine learning models that you guys make will eventually end up deployed.

301
00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:32.169
Anthony Taylor: which means somewhere in production and accessible usually as an Api or as a big batch thing. You run it against the whole table.

302
00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:40.849
Anthony Taylor: People will. one way or another, use your model as they do it. They're giving new data.

303
00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:44.909
Anthony Taylor: So they're saying. say, you have the classification model for

304
00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.320
Anthony Taylor: kind of the the customer segmentation.

305
00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:53.600
Anthony Taylor: New customer put it in the model. Put them in there in where we predicted them to be

306
00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.300
Anthony Taylor: okay. Model takes care of it for us.

307
00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:02.659
Anthony Taylor: New customer, new customer, new customer, all of them. They hit them all and put in whether we told them to be

308
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:06.289
Anthony Taylor: after a week. We have thousands of customers.

309
00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:14.900
Anthony Taylor: Maybe we want to go retrain and see if there's some other pattern with these new customers that we want to. Now label.

310
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:23.320
Anthony Taylor: okay? Or perhaps the new customers have actually changed the label on some of our existing ones

311
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:25.549
Anthony Taylor: which does happen

312
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:31.749
Anthony Taylor: doesn't happen. A lot depends on the only time I usually see something like that is like.

313
00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:43.530
Anthony Taylor: it hurts. We had some stuff like this where we we, you know. I don't know if you guys know anything about rental cars. But you guys know that Hertz made a deal with Tesla a couple years back.

314
00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:46.839
Anthony Taylor: and they have like I don't know

315
00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:50.230
Anthony Taylor: 500,000 Teslas, or some crazy number like that

316
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:56.570
Anthony Taylor: when they did that that messed with a lot of models, because now we didn't have fuel costing

317
00:28:57.970 --> 00:28:59.899
Anthony Taylor: and fuel costs was important.

318
00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:02.540
Anthony Taylor: Alright plus

319
00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:09.179
Anthony Taylor: fuel cost is part, is it? Do you know how much money rental car companies make on charging you for fuel?

320
00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.179
Anthony Taylor: It's a lot

321
00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:19.130
Anthony Taylor: I mean a lot like 5% of their profit. I mean, it's crazy.

322
00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:24.680
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if 5% of profit of like a herbs or Avis, that's, you know millions.

323
00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:30.050
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So anyway. free training is important.

324
00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:34.879
Anthony Taylor: But you're right. If you're not getting new data. And it's just like.

325
00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:41.709
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. I mean, even a recommendation engine, you you would want to retrain. So like, if you have a clustering algorithm

326
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.440
Anthony Taylor: right? And you recommend the song. So

327
00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:53.490
Anthony Taylor: Matt picks a song that Derek listened to. So we sent Matt recommendations from Derek's history, his cluster.

328
00:29:53.720 --> 00:30:00.170
Anthony Taylor: and then Matt listens to some of them. But then he listens to a song that Natalie listens to. Now

329
00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:06.420
Anthony Taylor: we want to retrain, because now we have a cluster where maybe Derek and Natalie are going to crossover.

330
00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:10.780
Anthony Taylor: and we're gonna have all new recommendations to hand up.

331
00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:14.749
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So anyway, retraining is important.

332
00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:20.779
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Questions. This is for the class

333
00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:28.080
Anthony Taylor: number one. The model performs well on training data, but poorly on testing data

334
00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:33.910
Anthony Taylor: which is likely more responsible for this problem.

335
00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:37.549
Anthony Taylor: High bias. We're high variants.

336
00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:42.340
sonja baro: I'm going to go on a limb and say, Hi, bias.

337
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:43.740
Anthony Taylor: See?

338
00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:49.470
Clayton Graves: I could answer that way, too. But if I have a different

339
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:58.439
Anthony Taylor: things are too. Yeah, I bias. It's bias. I bias. Okay. So here's the interesting thing. II entered that same way.

340
00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:01.479
Anthony Taylor: High bias means we vote fit. We don't generalize. Well.

341
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:05.259
Anthony Taylor: here's the problem. With this whole discussion.

342
00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:10.710
Anthony Taylor: high variance. Also, we don't generalize, but for a different reason.

343
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:21.940
Anthony Taylor: Literally, the opposite reason. I bias, we've guessed every single point. We're never going to miss. Okay high variance. We got this line, and we got dots all over the Dane place.

344
00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:29.650
Anthony Taylor: So we're still not generalizing. So you are correct. If you would have said either one

345
00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:39.420
Anthony Taylor:  a model that performs well on training data, but performs poorly on testing data. Is it underfitted or overfitted

346
00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:41.660
Clayton Graves: over?

347
00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:46.780
Anthony Taylor: Thank you. I think I've said that like 50 times since we started this course.

348
00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:51.920
Anthony Taylor: So I'm glad you guys got that to address overfitting.

349
00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:55.289
Anthony Taylor: Is it better to increase

350
00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:59.579
Anthony Taylor: or decrease the complexity of the model.

351
00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.199
Anthony Taylor: Yes, curry

352
00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:05.730
Gardner, Curry: decrease.

353
00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.560
Anthony Taylor: That is correct.

354
00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:12.369
Anthony Taylor: Very good. Yeah. We have a little bit of an understanding. Good job.

355
00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:16.760
Anthony Taylor: Now we're gonna get into some weird stuff.

356
00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:23.740
Anthony Taylor:  alright.

357
00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:31.719
Anthony Taylor: I really think this probably should have been an email optimization which is in a couple of weeks.

358
00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.690
Anthony Taylor:  but

359
00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:36.370
Anthony Taylor: we will explain it

360
00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:39.260
Anthony Taylor: because it's in today's lecture.

361
00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:48.019
Anthony Taylor:  So II don't. You guys can read this slide and what you I want you to listen to me

362
00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:54.469
Anthony Taylor: the way we tell you when we do train test split. Does everybody understand why we do

363
00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:55.830
Anthony Taylor: train tests with?

364
00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:05.880
Anthony Taylor: We want to have data that the model has never seen to test with right? So we train.

365
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:12.170
Anthony Taylor: And then we take this test data that it hasn't seen. We run predictions on it. It's never seen it. We see what it does.

366
00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.930
Anthony Taylor: Train test. Split. Okay.

367
00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:18.319
Anthony Taylor: K, full press validation.

368
00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:28.080
Anthony Taylor: It takes your data. It splits it by default into 5 segments.

369
00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:39.270
Anthony Taylor: It then takes those 5 segments and trains based on a portion of that data, reserving one

370
00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:42.450
Anthony Taylor: to test with.

371
00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:48.630
Anthony Taylor: Got it. So let's just assume for a second

372
00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.029
Anthony Taylor: you have a thousand rows a day.

373
00:33:51.860 --> 00:34:03.959
Anthony Taylor: Okay. you run K fold process. Validation with a linear regression model. It takes 200 rows of your data. splits that into segments of 5.

374
00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:07.749
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So we're at what 40 rows each.

375
00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:12.869
Anthony Taylor: Okay, takes one of them, sets it to the side

376
00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:18.900
Anthony Taylor: trains on the other 160 rows. Then test

377
00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:22.219
Anthony Taylor: that data that it pulls up

378
00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:25.590
Anthony Taylor: sounds good. Sounds like train test split. Right?

379
00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:35.229
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So what does K full cross validation do. It takes the net, it. It takes the same 200 growth.

380
00:34:36.489 --> 00:34:45.210
Anthony Taylor: but gets another segment and kicks it out. trains on what's on the data that's left. and then test against that signal.

381
00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:50.640
Anthony Taylor: the next one same thing, different segments, different segment, different segment.

382
00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:57.119
Anthony Taylor: Then it calculates the average of all of them

383
00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:01.589
Anthony Taylor: alright. Does that make sense to everybody.

384
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:08.889
Anthony Taylor: more or less, just like trained to split except for it's gonna do a whole bunch of runs.

385
00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:15.880
Anthony Taylor: Okay. are. yeah. And so this is pretty cool. Oh, go ahead.

386
00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:27.369
Dipinto, Matt:  okay. Sorry. So maybe a dumb question. But does it wind up doing 5 total runs or 25. Total 5 training. Well, in this case it's breaking it into 5.

387
00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:32.670
Anthony Taylor: So it does a training, 5 trainings and 5 predictions.

388
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.230
Anthony Taylor: right? Or scoring 5 scores. How's that.

389
00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.860
Dipinto, Matt: So cause then actually have to predict to do a school.

390
00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:52.049
Anthony Taylor: So it's going to do model dot fit for each one of these 200 rows. And then it's going to do a model dot score using the different section. Okay? So it essentially does 5 different 80, 20 train tests

391
00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:55.500
Anthony Taylor: 100, yes, 100%. That is correct.

392
00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:58.440
Clayton Graves: Yeah. But then it averages them together.

393
00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:01.330
Clayton Graves: Can you change those?

394
00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:07.190
Clayton Graves: Can you change breaks it into? And is there K equals? 5? Is is the default.

395
00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:11.699
Dipinto, Matt: and you might be getting so if you don't put anything you'll get 5.

396
00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:14.629
Dipinto, Matt: Is is this, too?

397
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:32.060
Dipinto, Matt: Give you a more reliable r-squared prediction out of your. It's it's called the enhanced. Our enhanced is the enhanced stars.

398
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:35.510
Anthony Taylor:  But like, I said, II

399
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:37.409
Dipinto, Matt: thank you. That's okay.

400
00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:45.390
Anthony Taylor: Oh, no, that's okay. I was going to ask the same questions as Matt. So

401
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:48.279
Raugewitz, Tania: he he got jailed before I did.

402
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:50.400
Now I was gonna ask.

403
00:36:50.440 --> 00:37:08.200
Raugewitz, Tania: is it? I mean hearing you talk a little bit more about it. I don't think so, but it it's kind of like an ensemble of methods, but it's an ensemble of the same models. Yeah.

404
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:17.689
Anthony Taylor: okay, but this isn't. In fact, it's gonna use the same. That's great. That was a a wonderful observation, literally wonderful.

405
00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:23.249
Anthony Taylor: Ensemble we do. There's a way to do that, too, and we I'm sure we'll get to it eventually.

406
00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:27.670
Anthony Taylor: But not today. But that's good. I like. yeah, Rodney.

407
00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:29.990
Masarirambi, Rodney: So

408
00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:35.580
Masarirambi, Rodney: I like it. Seems like you don't like this.

409
00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:36.730
Anthony Taylor: Sorry?

410
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:42.010
Masarirambi, Rodney: Excuse me so it seems like.

411
00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:44.220
Masarirambi, Rodney: well.

412
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:53.159
Masarirambi, Rodney: what are the downsides of doing it this way? Cause it kind of seems like you're getting, because the way I'm looking at is like like using the test split

413
00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:55.670
Anthony Taylor: time and money.

414
00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:05.530
Anthony Taylor: So I'm gonna tell you guys, if you guys take roles as data scientists or even as AI scientists later, right?

415
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:11.289
Anthony Taylor: The number one thing that's going to stop you from doing stuff like this time and money.

416
00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:19.650
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if you have, like a hundred 1 million rows of data, and you're trying to do a forecast like this.

417
00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:25.730
Anthony Taylor: right? I mean it could take weeks. And you're talking weeks on expensive hardware.

418
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:33.369
Anthony Taylor: So it's like, Hey, boss, I'm gonna spend $40,000 to do this. They're gonna be like, oh, no, you're not.

419
00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:35.910
Anthony Taylor: You're not find a cheaper way to do it.

420
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:42.209
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So you ever want someone like, I'm very fortunate. The company I'm at.

421
00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:48.999
Anthony Taylor: They're fantastic. They're like. is it? Gonna bring value? Yeah, okay. But

422
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:55.930
Anthony Taylor: you know, they'll be like, Yeah, go ahead. It's okay. They're private. They don't have to answer. And but so yeah.

423
00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:05.769
Anthony Taylor: did you write that in chat?

424
00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:12.919
Anthony Taylor: That was so weird.

425
00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:16.929
Anthony Taylor: Okay, anyway.

426
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.150
Anthony Taylor: yeah.

427
00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:26.830
Anthony Taylor: So  So let's talk real quick before we get into the instructor, do

428
00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:37.649
Anthony Taylor:  the shortcomings of R. 2. So the reason why we even will get into an enhanced or advanced, or whatever r, 2

429
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:39.730
Anthony Taylor: is that our 2

430
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:50.960
Anthony Taylor: is really good with like linear regression, it's like perfect. Because with linear regression, single one to one. Okay.

431
00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:56.840
Anthony Taylor: as soon as you start adding additional features. R, 2. Score

432
00:39:57.310 --> 00:39:59.700
Anthony Taylor: it tends to kind of add

433
00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:05.060
Anthony Taylor: towards. oh, you have more features. Then I'm gonna give you a higher school.

434
00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:10.040
Anthony Taylor: It's just the way the the function works that calculates

435
00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:16.999
Anthony Taylor: alright. The truth is, is, there is this little mathematical thing I'm going to show you which I don't care if you remember.

436
00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:25.550
Anthony Taylor: And oh, by the way. there's no challenge for this entire week. Just so, you guys know. you guys can clap and cheer now.

437
00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:28.110
Anthony Taylor: But yeah.

438
00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:31.530
Anthony Taylor: there's no challenge. I actually win it. Look.

439
00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:36.699
Masarirambi, Rodney: wait! There is. There's one do? Yeah, you love it?

440
00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:44.199
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Do in 2 days. Oh, no, that's for that's for 11, not for 12.

441
00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:46.660
sonja baro: Yeah. He found out this topic

442
00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:56.150
Anthony Taylor: right when I saw this, and I'm like, why we show them this. And then I was like, you know what? I'm gonna make sure it's in the homework. If it is, I gotta make sure they understand it.

443
00:40:56.830 --> 00:41:03.729
Anthony Taylor: Not on the homework. probably something you're never gonna see again after the next 15 min. Okay, but

444
00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:13.750
Clayton Graves: I want you to know it's there. Okay? So the way the way Chat Gp explained it to me was that

445
00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:18.419
Clayton Graves: the problem with R. 2 is that let's say you build a tower

446
00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:23.329
Clayton Graves: and R 2 measures. The stability of that tower.

447
00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:35.000
Clayton Graves: And if you add more blocks to it, it doesn't necessarily make your tower stronger. But R. 2 says it is so it's it's

448
00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:47.699
Clayton Graves: it's how you measure the overall strength, regardless of the number of blocks you have, you can have a tower that's super strong, with a small number of blocks and a tower that's weak with a whole bunch of blocks.

449
00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.340
Anthony Taylor: I like that.

450
00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:57.040
Anthony Taylor: I will say honestly, guys, we I mean chat. Tpt can explain some of this stuff. Really.

451
00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:00.220
Anthony Taylor: I'm not gonna lie. They're very creative.

452
00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:03.269
Anthony Taylor: I could even have it do it like fun stuff.

453
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:15.530
Anthony Taylor: But I try to explain it in such way that makes sense. So the most important thing I want you guys take away from that our team. It's still used like in every model scoring. It's the default method everywhere.

454
00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.190
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

455
00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:22.850
Anthony Taylor: it's not the only one. It's not necessarily the best one, but it's the most common.

456
00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:31.460
Anthony Taylor: What no one is going to look at you and go. Did you use adjusted Rg. For that? If they are just go And walk away.

457
00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:35.580
Anthony Taylor:  no, don't do that, because there might be somebody important.

458
00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:38.689
Anthony Taylor: just say, Oh, no, I'll jump right on that and then

459
00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:40.980
Anthony Taylor: go to lunch.

460
00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:50.839
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, yeah, okay, alright. So let's take a quick look and see what we're talking about. Okay, it's not. It's not bad. There's nothing wrong with it. It's just

461
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:57.209
Anthony Taylor: it's just one of those things where it's like, why, when you're doing that, if nobody actually does that

462
00:42:57.490 --> 00:43:04.079
Anthony Taylor:  yeah, I mean, I've heard people talk about it. And and it's

463
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:08.100
Anthony Taylor: they're just like. okay. So we're gonna read in some data.

464
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:11.929
Anthony Taylor:  pretty cool data.

465
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:13.070
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

466
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:16.249
Anthony Taylor: we are going to create

467
00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:24.590
Anthony Taylor: and x one array and an X, 2. Notice what the difference is. This, one

468
00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:33.459
Anthony Taylor: has 2 columns. This one has one. Okay, and then we're gonna make our Y variable. This

469
00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:36.920
Anthony Taylor: liters per 100 kilometers.

470
00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:39.659
Anthony Taylor: Okay. let's run that.

471
00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:42.490
Anthony Taylor: Now I

472
00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:52.009
Anthony Taylor: train test split is so creative you could pass in x, one, train X, one, test x 2, train x, 2 test y train y test

473
00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:56.850
Anthony Taylor: passing all of those in, and it will split all of them for you. It's very clever.

474
00:43:57.910 --> 00:44:00.909
Anthony Taylor: Alright. We're going to create 2 models.

475
00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:09.809
Anthony Taylor: same model. Just 2 times we're going to train them X, one train and X 2 train with y train.

476
00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:11.110
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

477
00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:18.039
Anthony Taylor: don't let all these variables get in your way. We have, we basically, we split the data 2 different ways. And we've trained 2 models.

478
00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:21.240
Anthony Taylor: That's all we've done. Alright. Now

479
00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:32.070
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna do. We're going to calculate our R 2 scores. Oh. as they are okay. So this is the way we've been doing.

480
00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:36.720
Anthony Taylor: So we have our A 2 0 1,

481
00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:39.160
Anthony Taylor: 8, 2, 0 2.

482
00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:45.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so what they want you to see here

483
00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:48.840
Anthony Taylor: in its very subtle way.

484
00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:53.070
Anthony Taylor: is that the R 2 score is slightly higher

485
00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.889
Anthony Taylor: with the 2

486
00:44:57.530 --> 00:45:00.499
Anthony Taylor: columns. Alright. Now.

487
00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:06.950
Anthony Taylor: yeah, let's just keep going. Okay. So here's how to do our 2 adjusted.

488
00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:15.660
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're going to take the score. We're going to take the number of columns in the X value.

489
00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:24.480
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then we're going to return this map. You can just save this map if you want to. Okay.

490
00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:38.210
Anthony Taylor: so and and with this map, it's going to give us the adjusted R. 2, which should well, will take into account the number of columns in our feature set.

491
00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:45.220
Anthony Taylor: So remember, we had one in x, one and 2 in x 2. Everybody remember that

492
00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:56.460
Anthony Taylor: haven't lost anybody yet. Okay, don't get hung up on this math, feel free to keep it, save it, put it in a folder. don't ever, you know it's up to you alright. So now we're gonna run this.

493
00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:01.139
Anthony Taylor: And now you can see. Look at this.

494
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:05.050
Anthony Taylor: the single

495
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:11.089
Anthony Taylor: feature model actually scored slightly better

496
00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:13.090
Anthony Taylor: the double feature model.

497
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:19.870
Anthony Taylor: Aye. that was pretty exciting

498
00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:25.000
Clayton Graves: for the tower, regardless of the number of blocks

499
00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.849
Anthony Taylor: that that's good. I think I and

500
00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:40.589
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna talk about that. We're gonna come back to this. But let me finish writing this this example. So cross validation we're going to do this is that thing with the the. It's going to do a section at a time.

501
00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:43.470
Anthony Taylor: So it's going to

502
00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:55.069
Anthony Taylor: cross vow score. Linear regression is the model X, one train Y train. We're going to use. R. 2 as the as the score it's going to use.

503
00:46:55.310 --> 00:47:02.839
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So it's gonna give us all the scores, the average of the scores and the standard deviation of the scores.

504
00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:12.240
Anthony Taylor: So it did exactly what that picture showed. split the data into 5 sections. and then each section into 5 sections.

505
00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:16.859
Anthony Taylor: Trained text train, text thing, text frame testing text.

506
00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:19.350
Anthony Taylor: And these are the scores it came up with.

507
00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:26.940
Anthony Taylor: And this is the average. And that's the standard deviation. Now, what's kind of interesting? Here.

508
00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:30.470
Anthony Taylor: look at the mean score

509
00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:34.369
Anthony Taylor: versus what we got up here.

510
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:41.250
Anthony Taylor: Okay. In fact, if you look at this. none of these

511
00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:44.590
Anthony Taylor: were that hot.

512
00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:48.450
Anthony Taylor: Okay, what does that mean, probably.

513
00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:54.239
Anthony Taylor: But I would look into it. If it was me. I would look into this deeper and see if I have something weird with my date.

514
00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:58.249
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so let's just quickly talk about the tower.

515
00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:03.130
Anthony Taylor: I like, like, I'm gonna use that. But thank you for that. How.

516
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.340
Anthony Taylor: while this does a good job of illustrating

517
00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:20.809
Anthony Taylor: that. Hey? Look, one feature gets slightly better than 2 in this thing. The reality is is, if you have more features, you're gonna get better accuracy

518
00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:26.260
Anthony Taylor: almost every time, unless those features are collinear, which we'll talk about later.

519
00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:33.819
Anthony Taylor: Okay. it's just I mean, that's not uncommon, actually, which 2 do you use. Maybe they're collinear. Maybe that's the problem.

520
00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:37.450
Anthony Taylor: Weight and cylinders. No, they're not. They have nothing to do with each other.

521
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:42.729
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if you put them in there. Well, cylinders isn't very helpful. So maybe.

522
00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:45.000
Anthony Taylor: But if you put them in there.

523
00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:50.659
Anthony Taylor: you know 2 of them, it's gonna do a better job predicting this value than just one.

524
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:53.510
Anthony Taylor: It's just the way it is.

525
00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:55.820
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But

526
00:48:56.970 --> 00:49:00.710
Anthony Taylor: adjusted is more accurate for our 2. Yeah, son.

527
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:08.809
sonja baro: So in this example, though where the cross validation wasn't as high

528
00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:18.930
sonja baro: of the oh down here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Is this where we start looking at statistical significance. Because

529
00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:30.989
Anthony Taylor: no, that's a great. That's a wonderful segue cause. That's the next election. But now, in this case, so keep in mind, it's using

530
00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:36.660
Anthony Taylor: to do its data. So this we were testing on X test.

531
00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:46.060
Anthony Taylor: And this is X, well, and so if I were going to do this for real. I would use the entire data set.

532
00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:47.630
sonja baro: Oh.

533
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:50.390
Anthony Taylor: yeah, in fact, we can technically.

534
00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:57.109
sonja baro: would you merge. do you not split because we still have it from? We have

535
00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:02.280
Anthony Taylor: not for this actually, that that did some bizarre stuff.

536
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:04.309
Anthony Taylor: I must put something wrong in there.

537
00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:08.090
Anthony Taylor: And I created XXY.

538
00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:10.470
Anthony Taylor: Oh.

539
00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:12.790
sonja baro: they're all super.

540
00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:15.000
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, that should've worked.

541
00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:21.260
Anthony Taylor: That's a weird outlet. Very strange.

542
00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:24.270
Anthony Taylor: I'm not sure why I did that.

543
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:30.200
Anthony Taylor: yeah. So you have to have the same number, so you can't do one without the other.

544
00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:32.869
Anthony Taylor: But we could do X 2 training.

545
00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:40.860
Anthony Taylor: see? And that looks right. This is interesting. I wanna look at why, that is, anyway.

546
00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:50.500
Anthony Taylor: yeah, I would just take it apart and figure out what the heck went wrong, if anything, cause I don't know that that's wrong. We've got some that are very close.

547
00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:52.090
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

548
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:57.909
Anthony Taylor:  as long as they're closer in the range. Then you don't get too worried about it.

549
00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:01.980
Anthony Taylor: You don't get too worried about it. But this is really small data.

550
00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:05.450
Anthony Taylor: When you do this in larger scale data, they're going to be functional.

551
00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:11.129
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And and let me explain that this way, if we have.

552
00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:13.400
Anthony Taylor: how many rows do we have

553
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:24.749
Anthony Taylor: 400 rows? When we do the train test split.

554
00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:29.160
Anthony Taylor: We're getting like, what? 2, 53, 2, 50,

555
00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:33.300
Anthony Taylor: 2, 5,300, 300, yeah, 300

556
00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:40.369
Anthony Taylor: more or less. Right? Versus 98. So we may not have very much data to work. And we're only looking at one column.

557
00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:50.009
Anthony Taylor: Alright, so it's just not. It's not great, it's not great. I wouldn't do it that way. But but the the the goal of this talk

558
00:51:50.290 --> 00:51:53.840
Anthony Taylor: was R. 2

559
00:51:55.690 --> 00:52:00.749
Anthony Taylor: tends to give a little more weight when you have more features, and it's not always

560
00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:03.840
Anthony Taylor: right to give it more weight. Get.

561
00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:10.359
Anthony Taylor: do this all the time. Never seen anybody worry about.

562
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:15.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we just know that it's just like a known thing. It's like, alright.

563
00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:25.650
Anthony Taylor: then matter. As long as you're consistent. See, that's the key. If you're always use our tour all the time, even though it has that mathematical peculiarity

564
00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:29.570
Anthony Taylor: right? No one is worried about point 1%,

565
00:52:30.850 --> 00:52:33.600
Anthony Taylor: even 1%. They're not worried about.

566
00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:40.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're looking. We're we're hoping to get up there, of course, but it's pretty rare that you're gonna concern yourself

567
00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:50.140
Anthony Taylor: alright, but there's still some great stuff. Cross validation is awesome. So I do want you guys to do this exercise. A.

568
00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:58.909
Anthony Taylor: They. They do some weird stuff here with just creating some, generating some data.

569
00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:03.470
Anthony Taylor: Go ahead good news is they give it to you. So all you really gotta do

570
00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.840
Anthony Taylor: is

571
00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:09.319
Anthony Taylor: oh, heck, they even stream test split. So you really just gotta do 2 models.

572
00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:11.420
Anthony Taylor: Look at the coefficient

573
00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:15.730
Anthony Taylor:  do your calculations again.

574
00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:17.379
Anthony Taylor: Got them together.

575
00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:20.889
Anthony Taylor: and then they give you adjusted. Run that.

576
00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:27.980
Anthony Taylor: and they're your cross valve. Okay. so very, very similar.

577
00:53:28.330 --> 00:53:34.640
Anthony Taylor: To the exercise we just did. Alright. Let's send before I send you a lid.

578
00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:40.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

579
00:53:40.610 --> 00:53:47.130
Anthony Taylor: welcome back. How'd you guys do? Are you guys all like K. Folded out?

580
00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:56.889
sonja baro: I don't know what I am. Anthony flattened. Actually

581
00:53:57.250 --> 00:53:58.920
Anthony Taylor: your K. Flattened.

582
00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:09.889
sonja baro: We were talking about about the sample data, and how, if we encountered something like that in the real world.

583
00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:15.319
Clayton Graves: 2 models wouldn't be necessary, because it would quite obvious that

584
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:17.309
Clayton Graves: there was no difference.

585
00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:20.140
Clayton Graves: But you know, in in terms of

586
00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:22.590
Clayton Graves: the exercise it made sense.

587
00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:24.930
Anthony Taylor: and and

588
00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:29.760
Anthony Taylor: probably one of the harder things to get across to any class.

589
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:38.850
Anthony Taylor: Okay, is that we? You know the the one thing that curriculum team that are not one thing, one of the things that the curriculum team does very well

590
00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:44.719
Anthony Taylor: is. And and I can tell you from having to write curriculum for this for the spark program.

591
00:54:44.890 --> 00:54:55.960
Anthony Taylor:  it's hard to find great examples that are easy to understand. Right? It's just hard to do so.

592
00:54:56.370 --> 00:55:04.849
Anthony Taylor: you know, I mean, in their case they kind of generated what? But it's not a simple thing to do, and so do their credit when they get it right? It's awesome.

593
00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:07.520
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Focus

594
00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:13.840
Anthony Taylor: prophecies.

595
00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:19.480
Anthony Taylor: How many of you guys did hypotheses in school?

596
00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:28.159
Clayton Graves: You come up with a theory. You come up with a theory of summary

597
00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:31.910
Clayton Graves: of of what you think is going to happen.

598
00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:36.569
Clayton Graves: and then you use methods to prove or disprove.

599
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:42.180
Anthony Taylor: So let me ask you guys, this.

600
00:55:42.370 --> 00:55:45.999
Anthony Taylor: come up with a hypothesis on data like from your project.

601
00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:53.829
Anthony Taylor: Okay. come or well, let's let's hear Jennifer's. Are you got one from your project, Jennifer? Are you got any old hypothesis?

602
00:55:54.010 --> 00:56:00.380
Jennifer Dahlgren: No, I was just asking, are you gonna go over what we just went over as a student exercise? Oh, my God, I totally forgot.

603
00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:02.940
Anthony Taylor: Thank you. Yes.

604
00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:10.959
Anthony Taylor: I never doubted you honestly. No, I totally forgot. Honestly, I was moving on.

605
00:56:11.290 --> 00:56:15.090
Anthony Taylor: Who's done like I'm out. Okay, I doubt it.

606
00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:22.919
Anthony Taylor: You doubt it, Ronnie. Thank you. But appreciate that. It's it's it's the Beard Club. He's in it.

607
00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:26.540
Anthony Taylor: But Derrick and me. and have

608
00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:33.550
Anthony Taylor: after you got the beer key. Patrick's got the goat. I don't even know what, Mike focus.

609
00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:35.769
Anthony Taylor: then, please.

610
00:56:37.090 --> 00:56:40.070
michael mcpherson: all right, here we go. I'm very full. Goatee

611
00:56:48.490 --> 00:56:54.269
Anthony Taylor: choke myself up there, all right. So all of this stuff you guys were given.

612
00:56:54.440 --> 00:57:01.320
Anthony Taylor: So I won't spend a ton of time here unless you guys want me to stop. Gonna drop some notes. Wait. Is this right? When

613
00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:06.360
Anthony Taylor: yeah, okay, we're gonna do our splits.

614
00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:12.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay. am I on the right one? This is the right one. Right?

615
00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:21.059
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Oh, yeah. Okay. Here it is. Alright. This is what I was looking for.  alright. So we're just gonna put some some values in there

616
00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:22.760
Anthony Taylor: to keep it interesting.

617
00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:27.000
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna pull price out of our original

618
00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:36.490
Anthony Taylor: data. hate it when I do that. And then we're going to create our train test splits. So this is where you guys started. Yeah.

619
00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:40.140
Anthony Taylor: So first model, then fit

620
00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:46.049
Anthony Taylor: perfect. Predict all the time. So we're gonna do our models for each of our

621
00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:48.170
Anthony Taylor: training sets.

622
00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:58.160
Anthony Taylor: And they asked us to look at coefficient. So we can look at coefficient here. Okay, in this particular case, the only one that matters is that for one

623
00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:12.430
Anthony Taylor:  And then we're going to run our predictions, do our calculations and come out with our R 2 scores. So here we see, we got point 6 3

624
00:58:12.570 --> 00:58:24.789
Anthony Taylor: point 6 3. There's no difference at all. Hmm. okay. But to do our adjusted. They gave us this cool map this cool function. but we're going to do it instead.

625
00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:28.619
Anthony Taylor: And look at that.

626
00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:36.599
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so here you can really see where the adjusted made a significant difference.

627
00:58:37.010 --> 00:58:47.809
Anthony Taylor: Hit it. Yes, maybe you did. Alright. I mean in the grand scheme of things. If we were doing this by percentages, that's a 10% difference.

628
00:58:48.090 --> 00:59:00.810
Anthony Taylor: Okay, for your cross valve, you're doing linear regression. Your one column training in this case. Y train R. 2, you're getting all the scores, the mean and then the standard deviation.

629
00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:04.720
Anthony Taylor: This is again. It's got one of those really low

630
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:12.449
Anthony Taylor: ones, couple of them, actually. But yeah, so there's your cross validation. And you can see that. Now.

631
00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:18.780
Anthony Taylor: why is it? This is an interesting thing. Right? Yeah. Timing question.

632
00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:26.149
Raugewitz, Tania: But yes. So why? and your one column adjusted versus your multi column adjusted? Is there a

633
00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:28.939
Raugewitz, Tania: 10% difference? When we did.

634
00:59:29.810 --> 00:59:33.320
Raugewitz, Tania: the columns didn't affect the score above

635
00:59:34.110 --> 00:59:36.349
Anthony Taylor: up here. Yeah, this one.

636
00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:40.320
Anthony Taylor: Well, cause. Remember our 2 well.

637
00:59:42.310 --> 00:59:47.710
Anthony Taylor: what we what I would have liked them to do is give you data that the R. 2 should have been higher here.

638
00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:50.090
Anthony Taylor: Okay, however.

639
00:59:50.170 --> 00:59:55.520
Anthony Taylor: it didn't affect between one and 2, but you can see with the adjusted

640
00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:59.790
Anthony Taylor: it, it actually should have been low is what they're trying to claim.

641
01:00:00.090 --> 01:00:03.349
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Because the multi columns mean anything.

642
01:00:03.370 --> 01:00:09.669
Anthony Taylor: This gave it more weight than it should have, which actually made these equal. But the reality is

643
01:00:09.810 --> 01:00:14.339
Anthony Taylor: is it should have been lower than the single call is what they're trying to say.

644
01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:19.280
Anthony Taylor: okay. So because there were multiple columns, the adjusted R 2 score

645
01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:21.000
Anthony Taylor: gave us a lower score.

646
01:00:21.370 --> 01:00:28.340
Clayton Graves: It's not as good.

647
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:34.690
Dipinto, Matt: The yeah. The issue with that is, that it doesn't take into

648
01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:52.790
Dipinto, Matt: account any of the actual like values or coefficients or weights of the columns. It just takes a raw number of columns and degrades your R squared. Based on that. So with real data, it would give a valuable output. But with the fake data, it just says, You know. Okay, you had 9 columns. So it's

649
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:58.819
Dipinto, Matt: Matt. I'll agree with you 100% on this data

650
01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:01.549
Anthony Taylor: right again. Like I said.

651
01:01:03.830 --> 01:01:12.409
Anthony Taylor: no matter like like I said. you don't see this a lot. Okay, you just don't. I mean, I'm sure there are people out there that use it.

652
01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:17.020
Anthony Taylor: I mean, we wouldn't. It wouldn't even be out there if it wasn't used at all.

653
01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:22.580
Anthony Taylor: But there's so many holes in this. And and and you guys see it in this example.

654
01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:30.319
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this, this makes it look like the model is terrible. But the truth be known. Model is basically the same.

655
01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:33.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But this because of this math.

656
01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:40.749
Anthony Taylor: It's going to lower that R. 2 score based on the number of columns doesn't matter what the columns are.

657
01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:47.819
Anthony Taylor: There's no clue. It doesn't care. It's 100% doing it based on the number of columns.

658
01:01:48.380 --> 01:02:03.669
Dipinto, Matt: Just to be clear. I'm not.

659
01:02:04.070 --> 01:02:05.260
Anthony Taylor: It's like.

660
01:02:05.490 --> 01:02:09.080
Anthony Taylor: how would this? How would I point this out. It's like,

661
01:02:09.570 --> 01:02:12.860
Masarirambi, Rodney: it's it's not you. It's not me, it's you.

662
01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:18.920
Anthony Taylor: No, it's like it's like learning how to parallel part

663
01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.749
Anthony Taylor: right? How many of you parallel park.

664
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:30.050
Anthony Taylor: That's so funny. I I'm great at right? I mean, I actually use private school bus. Okay?

665
01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.560
Anthony Taylor: And and and

666
01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:36.890
Anthony Taylor: the the thing is is like my kids, none of them, none of them

667
01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:44.229
Anthony Taylor: I'm like, isn't that useful? And they said, No, we've never needed to do okay. But almost, old guy, we do it all the time

668
01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:47.869
Anthony Taylor: right? It's like we find parallel. Well.

669
01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:52.889
Anthony Taylor: they're like, Nope never had to parallel Park. I'm like, How old are you?

670
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:56.529
Raugewitz, Tania: So I was 26 year old, never parallel.

671
01:02:57.610 --> 01:03:09.340
Raugewitz, Tania: I was in Denver with the client, and we were going out, not drinking and driving, but out to the clubs. And so these narrow streets I had to parallel Park in between.

672
01:03:09.490 --> 01:03:15.339
Raugewitz, Tania: and that was perfect, and I can't tell you oh, he was impressed that I that I

673
01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:24.849
Anthony Taylor: and these days you could buy a car that does it for you. So. But yeah, I'm with you on that. II don't know if that was a great example, because people actually do parallel part

674
01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:28.299
michael mcpherson: and there are things. I'm not the psychiatrist.

675
01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:30.510
michael mcpherson: Let's not ask. Well.

676
01:03:31.010 --> 01:03:41.899
Anthony Taylor: I will tell you guys this, I have not done every possible thing ever in data science. I've just a lot. And I've worked with a lot of data science. And I can tell you

677
01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:44.070
Anthony Taylor: this is not something we normally do

678
01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:47.620
Anthony Taylor: doesn't mean it's wrong. Just means that we don't normally do.

679
01:03:47.930 --> 01:03:50.840
Anthony Taylor: or at least in my experience. Okay.

680
01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:57.829
Anthony Taylor: don't we? Good with this, everybody. Pretty. Okay. I'm I'm actually excited that they showed you because we didn't used to show

681
01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:01.750
Anthony Taylor: this one. Okay, this one's actually kind of cool.

682
01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:05.869
Anthony Taylor: Alright. this one I liked a little bit.

683
01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:10.270
Anthony Taylor: But yeah. alright.

684
01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:15.940
Anthony Taylor: thank you, Jennifer, for reminding me to do

685
01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:20.659
Anthony Taylor: time offices. So back to my question.

686
01:04:22.770 --> 01:04:32.200
Anthony Taylor: Come up with a hypothesis about some data, Eddie, like like you didn't use your project. Go up with a hypothesis. What do you think a hypothesis might sound

687
01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:44.370
Clayton Graves: that? Do we believe that there is a direct correlation between the number of kids and foster care and the number of high school dropouts. and which is and median income.

688
01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:53.910
Clayton Graves: that that that the lower the Median income, the higher the the number of foster children, and thus high school dropouts.

689
01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:57.530
Anthony Taylor: That's fine. all right. Anybody else.

690
01:04:58.970 --> 01:05:02.499
Derek Rikke: If I pass this class I can get a data job.

691
01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:06.999
Anthony Taylor: If I pass this class, then I will get a date but

692
01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:09.230
Anthony Taylor: anybody else.

693
01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:12.790
Anthony Taylor: Alright, now, I'm gonna really challenge

694
01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:19.869
Anthony Taylor: Derek. What's the null hypothesis of your hypothesis?

695
01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:26.369
Anthony Taylor: Okay, Tanya is gonna answer. The null hypothesis go ahead.

696
01:05:27.030 --> 01:05:31.990
Raugewitz, Tania: Well, in lineman's terms, that there will be no effect.

697
01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:38.479
Anthony Taylor: Well, they well, yeah, cause you still not have a day to tell.

698
01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:44.570
Raugewitz, Tania: That would be true, or that you could get a data job with or without this class.

699
01:05:44.620 --> 01:06:06.080
Anthony Taylor: I'm sorry, Noel. Hypothesis. Hypothesis to hypothesis. Yeah. In general, I wasn't speaking to Derek. So the the the bottom line isn't. We're going to talk about 2 types of hypothesis.

700
01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:15.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay. a null and an alternative. Now, I love that we mentioned the alternative. Jennifer is probably already rolling her eyes and revived.

701
01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:18.539
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're not gonna call it alternative ever

702
01:06:18.930 --> 01:06:24.900
Anthony Taylor: just right now for the next 2 slides. And then from that point on, we're just going to call it hypothesis.

703
01:06:25.610 --> 01:06:28.420
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So here we go. Oh.

704
01:06:28.810 --> 01:06:34.180
Anthony Taylor:  So a hypothesis itself, or the alternative in this case

705
01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:36.099
Anthony Taylor: isn't. If, then, statement.

706
01:06:36.110 --> 01:06:39.220
Anthony Taylor: I take this class, then I get a data job.

707
01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:43.849
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Good. Good hypothesis.

708
01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:49.180
Anthony Taylor: A null hypothesis is the opposite

709
01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:50.500
Anthony Taylor: a

710
01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:52.809
Anthony Taylor: the the the alternative.

711
01:06:52.850 --> 01:06:57.399
Anthony Taylor: So if I take this class, I don't get a data job. Or, as Matt pointed out.

712
01:06:57.550 --> 01:07:00.120
Anthony Taylor: I get a data job whether or not I take this. But

713
01:07:01.290 --> 01:07:03.510
Anthony Taylor: okay,

714
01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:07.489
Raugewitz, Tania: yeah, or go ahead. Oh, God, I'm I'm on that unmute.

715
01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:10.189
Anthony Taylor: Oh, okay, good.

716
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:11.370
Anthony Taylor: So

717
01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:17.559
Anthony Taylor: our job is to statistically disprove

718
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.540
Anthony Taylor: the null hypothesis.

719
01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:25.149
Anthony Taylor: And that allows us to move forward with the alternative hypothesis.

720
01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:27.420
Anthony Taylor: Does that make sense?

721
01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:37.850
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're gonna you're gonna see how this works so. And, by the way, note right here, moving forward, we will refer to the alternative hypothesis and just the

722
01:07:38.010 --> 01:07:40.140
Anthony Taylor: hypothesis. so

723
01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:45.720
Anthony Taylor: sorry except for on this next slide. We're not going to do that.

724
01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:49.000
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna call it the alternative again.

725
01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:56.419
Anthony Taylor: So a null hypothesis might be migraine severity when taking this new drug is the same as when taking the old drug.

726
01:07:57.830 --> 01:08:08.490
Anthony Taylor: which means our hypothesis, is migraine. Severity with taking the new drug is statistically significant. Leave better or worse than when taking the old drug.

727
01:08:09.930 --> 01:08:14.230
Anthony Taylor: So this is where we start. If this turns out to be true

728
01:08:15.010 --> 01:08:16.770
Anthony Taylor: and this false.

729
01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:20.719
Anthony Taylor: then we can go. All right. Let's go build machine learning model.

730
01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:24.709
Anthony Taylor: Otherwise there's no point.

731
01:08:25.939 --> 01:08:41.269
Anthony Taylor: That's what the theory behind all of this is. Okay. So how do we do this. So first, you got to come up with the hypothesis and a null hypothesis. Second, you're going to identify the appropriate statistical test we're going to use just one.

732
01:08:42.310 --> 01:08:43.760
Anthony Taylor: We'll get there in a second.

733
01:08:43.770 --> 01:08:51.059
Anthony Taylor: We're going to determine the acceptable acceptable significance value. So this test is going to return a number.

734
01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:55.860
Anthony Taylor: We have to determine what is considered acceptable.

735
01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:59.139
Anthony Taylor: We're going to compute the p-value.

736
01:08:59.729 --> 01:09:02.629
Anthony Taylor: which is typically the statistical

737
01:09:02.790 --> 01:09:08.029
Anthony Taylor: and then we're gonna determine if it rejects the null hypothesis. Now.

738
01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:14.909
Anthony Taylor: I agree with this. Almost everywhere I go. This is typically less than point 0 5.

739
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:17.640
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

740
01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:21.539
Anthony Taylor: if it's less than point 0 5, we say, yep, it's good to go.

741
01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:25.729
Anthony Taylor: If it's higher than point 0 5, then we go.

742
01:09:26.430 --> 01:09:27.340
Anthony Taylor: maybe not.

743
01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:29.229
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

744
01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:34.910
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So in an analysis, we test the hypothesis whether we can reject the null hypothesis

745
01:09:35.090 --> 01:09:37.060
Anthony Taylor: if we can reject it.

746
01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:41.420
Anthony Taylor: The only option left here we go again is the hypothesis

747
01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:49.590
Anthony Taylor: which means you can go forward with your theory. Alright. So let's see this in action.

748
01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:54.199
Anthony Taylor: It's not as complicated as it sounds like prompts.

749
01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.460
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So we have some data.

750
01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:07.429
Anthony Taylor: So here's our car data 26. Column 5. Well, we're looking at that

751
01:10:07.450 --> 01:10:09.230
Anthony Taylor: and get rid of the nose.

752
01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:12.469
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna pull out the price.

753
01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:17.690
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna reshape the price for the Y values.

754
01:10:17.730 --> 01:10:29.009
Raugewitz, Tania: hey, Anthony, can I? Can I ask a question about that? Please do. I'm sorry no did at one time. Did you say that we taking out the noles.

755
01:10:29.190 --> 01:10:34.649
Raugewitz, Tania: the nulls. Yeah, you should never, really, ever do that.

756
01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:41.659
Anthony Taylor: Not this way. Because and this is this is a thing with the with program. Right?

757
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:50.819
Anthony Taylor: In the real world you would never want to drop an entire row because one value is null. Alright, you would typically do like a fill in a.

758
01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:56.000
Anthony Taylor: or maybe drop an A for a specific column. But yeah, this is.

759
01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:04.489
Anthony Taylor: this is like a blanket. You know, one column is. No, we're gonna drop the whole thing. This is not something you would normally do.

760
01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:06.110
Anthony Taylor: Rare.

761
01:11:06.450 --> 01:11:10.469
Raugewitz, Tania: Would you want to do this? Okay, but that's not the easy fix.

762
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:19.320
Anthony Taylor: It's just a quick way to keep. Get through the data. That's what yeah. Cause we could like, go in. And now analyze all of this.

763
01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:21.459
Anthony Taylor: find everything that's no

764
01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:25.890
Anthony Taylor: and you know and say, Oh, we only need to do this, what?

765
01:11:26.770 --> 01:11:29.119
Anthony Taylor: And maybe that's good enough. But anyway.

766
01:11:29.610 --> 01:11:34.130
Anthony Taylor: so but thank you for asking. I like to remind people of that, too. So

767
01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:40.280
Anthony Taylor: alright. So we drop price in our X data are features.

768
01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:47.169
Anthony Taylor: And then here we're gonna grab price and put it into our Y, so this is our value. We're trying to predict

769
01:11:47.770 --> 01:11:50.090
Anthony Taylor: we're then going to do our train test split.

770
01:11:50.990 --> 01:12:04.620
Anthony Taylor: Now, we're going to grab this stats model?  method, basically. And we're going to do linear regression. We're going to use. O. Ls, which is a type of model.

771
01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:06.010
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

772
01:12:06.170 --> 01:12:08.389
Anthony Taylor: For this

773
01:12:08.710 --> 01:12:11.169
Anthony Taylor: process, as I can see, there's some, maybe

774
01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:19.410
Anthony Taylor: something in that name that means anything. Nope, all right. So we'll run this. And now we have selected our model and trained it.

775
01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:24.429
Anthony Taylor: Okay. now, we're going to sort our P values.

776
01:12:26.850 --> 01:12:28.339
Anthony Taylor: This is kind of interesting.

777
01:12:29.670 --> 01:12:32.269
Anthony Taylor: So in this case.

778
01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:40.490
Anthony Taylor: interesting. All right. Well, here, we're gonna keep going with this for a second.

779
01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:51.919
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to collect the variables in this that meet our point 0 5. So we can see, make definitely drive wheels drove

780
01:12:52.480 --> 01:13:00.680
Anthony Taylor: herb weights up to about here. So pretty much these guys. Everybody understand that

781
01:13:01.050 --> 01:13:04.220
Anthony Taylor: we're still in the oh.

782
01:13:04.370 --> 01:13:07.590
Anthony Taylor: oh, that's cool. I haven't done it this way before

783
01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:20.880
Anthony Taylor: I like this. Okay? Sorry. I just had an Aha moment.  This is a new new one. I haven't tried. Alright. So with this, we can select the proper columns

784
01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:25.240
Anthony Taylor: for our model. We're going to

785
01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:28.870
Anthony Taylor: get the full data and the selected data

786
01:13:29.190 --> 01:13:37.410
Anthony Taylor: create 2 linear regression models and fit them. get our R 2 adjusted and then output it.

787
01:13:38.210 --> 01:13:40.620
Anthony Taylor: Okay, look at that.

788
01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:44.450
Anthony Taylor: So with all our features.

789
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:52.859
Anthony Taylor: we ended up with. I wanna make sure I'm saying it right X, full. Yeah. So with all our features, we got a terrible score.

790
01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:58.010
Anthony Taylor: But by lowering the number of features. We got a better score.

791
01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:00.440
Anthony Taylor: Not bad.

792
01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:09.410
Anthony Taylor: Okay. not bad at all. So this allowed us to do feature selection based on

793
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:12.820
Anthony Taylor:  that p-value that came out.

794
01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:16.669
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's pretty fun.

795
01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:18.100
Anthony Taylor: Somebody like that.

796
01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:20.880
Anthony Taylor: Awesome.

797
01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:27.890
Dipinto, Matt: I think. I zoned out for a minute a very important conversation somewhere in the middle of this.

798
01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:30.740
Dipinto, Matt: what does the p-value tell us?

799
01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:36.739
Anthony Taylor: It is the the, the value returned from the method?

800
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:44.210
Anthony Taylor: Okay, from the the statistical method that we're running here. This Sm method. Okay? And

801
01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:57.250
Anthony Taylor: what we're what we're actually looking for is for it to not cross a certain threshold. If it doesn't cross that threshold, we decide that this value is statistically significant to the model.

802
01:14:58.010 --> 01:15:01.470
Anthony Taylor: Right? So by selecting these

803
01:15:01.810 --> 01:15:11.620
Dipinto, Matt: these other ones, we're saying, are not statistically significant to this model, and that makes sense. And I remember the P. Less than 5, I guess.

804
01:15:11.930 --> 01:15:16.980
Raugewitz, Tania: No, it's the it's the probability value.

805
01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:19.989
Raugewitz, Tania: So that when it's point 0 5, it means

806
01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:24.140
Raugewitz, Tania: 95% of the time it's going to happen that way.

807
01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:31.789
Anthony Taylor: That is correct. I like that. That's the that's why those point 0 5. Is that what you were looking for

808
01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:33.620
Anthony Taylor: Matt.

809
01:15:33.730 --> 01:15:38.700
Dipinto, Matt: Yes, I still don't know what the magic is used to calculate it.

810
01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:43.370
Anthony Taylor: The good news is like everything else we don't necessarily have to know.

811
01:15:43.650 --> 01:15:45.290
Raugewitz, Tania: Can I give you an example?

812
01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:51.309
Anthony Taylor: Sure, II like it. I love it. When you guys do that, go right ahead it.

813
01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:57.619
Raugewitz, Tania: So you know I've created a crop nutrient, and I have crop trials going on.

814
01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:02.839
Raugewitz, Tania: and and and the reproducibility. We have small plot trials

815
01:16:02.890 --> 01:16:14.559
Raugewitz, Tania: and grow or scaled trials. But in the small plot trails trials will use obviously, St. Statistics to calculate the viable, and our p-value

816
01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:17.159
Raugewitz, Tania: is

817
01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:29.309
Raugewitz, Tania: less than point o 5, which means that 95% of the time when you use my product, you're going to get a yield increase like this in these conditions. So

818
01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:35.440
Raugewitz, Tania: like in strawberries, you're gonna get a 17% yield increase when you use this product in Florida.

819
01:16:35.490 --> 01:16:40.629
Dipinto, Matt: Okay? So in like 1920 test cases, you see a positive correlation.

820
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:51.060
Raugewitz, Tania: And it was statistically significant enough. And with the p-value of point O, 5, meaning that 95% of the time you're gonna get this this result.

821
01:16:52.170 --> 01:16:52.910
Dipinto, Matt: Okay.

822
01:16:53.070 --> 01:16:58.699
Raugewitz, Tania: thank you. Versus 50, like. So grower is, gonna say.

823
01:16:58.850 --> 01:17:07.289
Raugewitz, Tania: is going to want to see that and say, 95 of the time you're gonna see something meaningful when you use XY or Z in your.

824
01:17:08.010 --> 01:17:08.750
Raugewitz, Tania: I'm

825
01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:11.620
Raugewitz, Tania: growing that I did.

826
01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:13.719
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to use that, Tanya. Thank you.

827
01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:16.450
Anthony Taylor: That's freaking awesome.

828
01:17:17.210 --> 01:17:28.010
sonja baro: I like that real world. So in this example, though, we were saying that those first 5 items make drive will cause we're sorting it

829
01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:32.879
sonja baro: right? Right? II, yeah, those particular features.

830
01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:36.179
sonja baro: 95% of the time

831
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:39.829
sonja baro: we're going to are statistically valid.

832
01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:43.390
sonja baro: Our value will yield something. Right? Yeah.

833
01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:54.990
Anthony Taylor: So this is doing it with ordinary least squares. It's just concentrations. I was just looking at Ols to see if that could give us something.

834
01:17:55.340 --> 01:18:02.239
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, we don't actually share the p-value function. Matt, this is one of those. And

835
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:06.040
Anthony Taylor: this is this is how I'm going to answer that

836
01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:18.800
Anthony Taylor: other than linear regression. which is the Y equals Mx plus B, and we cover it like 15 times. We will never show you the function behind the function.

837
01:18:19.190 --> 01:18:31.609
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this is just one of those things where it's like, well, I love Tanya's example. I'm going to actually use that and we could get into the exact definition of what p-value is

838
01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:38.659
Anthony Taylor: the important thing in this particular case is that what we are looking for is a threshold

839
01:18:38.910 --> 01:18:41.629
Anthony Taylor: that is usually point 0 5.

840
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:44.890
Anthony Taylor: It can be less, can be more.

841
01:18:45.530 --> 01:18:50.490
Anthony Taylor: Usually it's point 0 5. So that's what we were looking for. Alright.

842
01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:55.159
Anthony Taylor: Thank you. So we have. We have the very well we have.

843
01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:57.170
Anthony Taylor: and everyone do.

844
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:59.800
Anthony Taylor: hey? So

845
01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:07.009
Anthony Taylor: I was going through my comments. and I wanted to

846
01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:13.990
Anthony Taylor: kind of get a vote. You guys like to everyone dues. Would you rather be sent away to do an activity.

847
01:19:15.170 --> 01:19:16.850
Anthony Taylor: Everyone dues are good.

848
01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:25.280
Raugewitz, Tania: I like that. Everyone do is if we don't go too quickly through them, like we're really hashing the

849
01:19:25.330 --> 01:19:26.679
Raugewitz, Tania: breakout rooms, too.

850
01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:29.070
Anthony Taylor: Got you? I got you.

851
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:30.340
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

852
01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:33.270
Anthony Taylor: So that'll be. The goal is to get through this

853
01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:36.720
Anthony Taylor: relatively, thoroughly.

854
01:19:38.210 --> 01:19:40.540
We're doing pretty good on time. So

855
01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:43.199
Anthony Taylor: not too worried today.

856
01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:49.709
Anthony Taylor: And worst case next class, we have lots of spare time.

857
01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:52.430
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So

858
01:19:52.510 --> 01:19:56.949
Anthony Taylor: bringing in train test split linear regression. Bring in some fun data

859
01:19:58.410 --> 01:20:02.820
Anthony Taylor: 42 columns, lots of fun stuff.

860
01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:08.559
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're gonna for X, we're going to predict price. So we're gonna remove price

861
01:20:08.810 --> 01:20:12.859
Anthony Taylor: from our data. And then we're going to full price

862
01:20:12.910 --> 01:20:15.560
Anthony Taylor: out of our data to put into why?

863
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:22.340
Anthony Taylor: So now we have our target and we have our features from there. We're going to do a train test split.

864
01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:28.330
Anthony Taylor: And now it's time to do some coding.

865
01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:37.480
Anthony Taylor: So we've already imported. Sm, we're going to do just like we did in the other one, we'll create an Lr, we'll say it equals Sm, dot

866
01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:39.720
Anthony Taylor: OLS.

867
01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:50.880
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna pass in our Y train and our X train. and then in the same one, you'll do a fit.

868
01:20:52.010 --> 01:20:58.250
Anthony Taylor: and we'll run that. And that's a beautiful thing. Okay. Now to see the p-value.

869
01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:05.250
Anthony Taylor: We're going to call the property of this model.

870
01:21:06.270 --> 01:21:08.230
Anthony Taylor: which is, in fact.

871
01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:13.030
Anthony Taylor: dot p-values.

872
01:21:13.210 --> 01:21:16.799
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna say, LR. Dot p values

873
01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:19.579
Anthony Taylor:  And then we're going to sort them.

874
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:24.050
Anthony Taylor: And

875
01:21:24.270 --> 01:21:25.100
that's it.

876
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.349
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then we're gonna show P values.

877
01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:35.929
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So I don't know, are any of these any good?

878
01:21:37.290 --> 01:21:39.810
Anthony Taylor: Those all look like big numbers to me.

879
01:21:44.830 --> 01:21:47.270
Dipinto, Matt: Those are all micro numbers. Anthony.

880
01:21:47.850 --> 01:21:53.800
Anthony Taylor: Darn it, Matt. you catch me every time. Yeah, guys, look at these numbers.

881
01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:58.550
Anthony Taylor: These, this is negative, 121 decimal places.

882
01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:01.599
Clayton Graves: Oh, is that what that means? Micro number?

883
01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:08.379
Anthony Taylor: Well, it means it's it's scientific notation. So this is negative 16 decimal places.

884
01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:12.550
sonja baro: So you'd have to go like 0, 0 0 0 0. They're all a 5

885
01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:17.990
Anthony Taylor: pretty doggone close. Maybe some of these down here. Not so much

886
01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:27.480
Anthony Taylor: is signifying as well in there. Yes, ma'am, that means that it. That means that it is fine. If you see any.

887
01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:29.500
Anthony Taylor: either minus or plus.

888
01:22:29.550 --> 01:22:35.599
Anthony Taylor: If it's plus, you're adding decimal to the right. it's negative. You're at. You're taking decimals to the left.

889
01:22:36.370 --> 01:22:38.230
Anthony Taylor: They're moving the decimal to the left.

890
01:22:38.590 --> 01:22:42.849
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so here's how we're gonna do this, we can do a select

891
01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:50.310
Anthony Taylor: columns. We're gonna create a variable called select columns. And we're gonna say, P values.

892
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:51.960
Anthony Taylor: dot.

893
01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:55.150
Anthony Taylor: look, we've all done that before.

894
01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:59.029
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna say, P values

895
01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:01.429
Anthony Taylor: less than 0 point 5

896
01:23:02.770 --> 01:23:04.489
Anthony Taylor: 0 point 0

897
01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:05.320
Anthony Taylor: 5.

898
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:08.279
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then we can show

899
01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:10.630
Anthony Taylor: what we end up with

900
01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:13.610
Anthony Taylor: alright.

901
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:19.409
Anthony Taylor: and there you go. So these are all of the ones where it was actually less. 0 5.

902
01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:24.749
Anthony Taylor: That was nifty home. That's the way to do it.

903
01:23:25.230 --> 01:23:28.490
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. So now that we have that

904
01:23:29.170 --> 01:23:35.449
Anthony Taylor: let's create a new variable. So first, we have our our all of our data

905
01:23:36.270 --> 01:23:41.550
Anthony Taylor: tax underscore full equals X. And then

906
01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:47.939
Anthony Taylor: let's get our selected, our new data that we just select. Basically, we're going to reproduce what we did

907
01:23:48.010 --> 01:23:49.719
Anthony Taylor: in the other

908
01:23:50.230 --> 01:23:53.189
Anthony Taylor:  thing. So

909
01:23:53.750 --> 01:24:01.139
Anthony Taylor: in the in the instructor thing. So what do we do here? We said, give me X, but only give me the columns that are in this list.

910
01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:05.290
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we can run that

911
01:24:06.430 --> 01:24:14.169
Anthony Taylor: good. Now we'll do a train test split. So this is X underscore full comma. Oh, X underscore full

912
01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:17.820
Anthony Taylor: underscore train comma

913
01:24:18.410 --> 01:24:21.020
x underscore full

914
01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:22.340
Anthony Taylor: underscore.

915
01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:27.020
Anthony Taylor: Oh, my goodness, what'd I do and

916
01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:30.099
Anthony Taylor: underscore test ka ma!

917
01:24:30.110 --> 01:24:35.620
Anthony Taylor: And then we're gonna do the smaller ones. X underscore, Sla. Train

918
01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:44.190
Anthony Taylor: X underscore SLE. Test. And then why train?

919
01:24:45.330 --> 01:24:46.090
Anthony Taylor: How about

920
01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:48.410
Anthony Taylor: y? Yes.

921
01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:57.680
Anthony Taylor: okay. And then that is going to be train test split parentheses X underscore full

922
01:24:58.230 --> 01:25:05.179
Anthony Taylor: comma x underscore SLE comma y. Alright. So we run that. Oh.

923
01:25:06.450 --> 01:25:12.409
Anthony Taylor:  Now, we just need to create our models. Okay, so this is, we're gonna model

924
01:25:15.950 --> 01:25:16.930
Anthony Taylor: model.

925
01:25:17.330 --> 01:25:23.799
Anthony Taylor: just like we've been doing since we started. Machine learning which, honest to God, was barely 2 weeks ago.

926
01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:26.830
Anthony Taylor: feels like we've been doing this for a while.

927
01:25:29.610 --> 01:25:35.739
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then we're going to fit each one. So LR, one gonna fit to our full data.

928
01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:44.190
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to go expul train. and why train?

929
01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:51.989
Anthony Taylor: And then LR. 2, we're gonna fit to our selected data.

930
01:25:54.490 --> 01:25:56.340
Anthony Taylor: And Ytrain.

931
01:25:58.870 --> 01:26:00.730
Anthony Taylor: okay, that looks good.

932
01:26:01.090 --> 01:26:12.839
Anthony Taylor: We're feeling good here. Oh, there's our cool R adjusted. And last, but not least, we just have to compare. This is a lot of typing. So bear with a Dj underscore score, one

933
01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:18.790
Anthony Taylor: equals R, 2 underscore adjusted.

934
01:26:18.910 --> 01:26:23.419
Anthony Taylor: And we're going to pass an X underscore full underscore test.

935
01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:25.559
Anthony Taylor: And why test?

936
01:26:27.130 --> 01:26:28.809
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to say.

937
01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:30.769
Anthony Taylor: LR, one.

938
01:26:31.110 --> 01:26:33.110
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so that's the model we're using.

939
01:26:34.290 --> 01:26:37.629
And then we're gonna do Ajj

940
01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:40.820
Anthony Taylor: underscore score 2

941
01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:48.549
Anthony Taylor: equals R to adjust X underscore select underscore tests.

942
01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:51.050
Anthony Taylor: A y and test

943
01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:52.849
Anthony Taylor: comma LR 2,

944
01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:57.959
Anthony Taylor: and then print them out. So

945
01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:01.100
Anthony Taylor: grant f

946
01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:38.969
Anthony Taylor: everybody with me on all this good stuff. It's pretty much the same as the instructor thing. So I don't know we're getting a whole lot of doing this. But and then there you go. That's an absolutely terrible sport.

947
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:51.559
Anthony Taylor: absolutely terrible. However. the selected ones, R is slightly better than the other.

948
01:27:51.570 --> 01:27:53.979
Anthony Taylor: So when you think about it, guys

949
01:27:55.220 --> 01:28:00.210
Anthony Taylor: again, this is back to what I told you with regression. You're trying to guess this number.

950
01:28:00.730 --> 01:28:03.579
Anthony Taylor: basically between 0 and infinity.

951
01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:08.779
Anthony Taylor: And if it misses it even by a doll, it's considered wrong.

952
01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:12.240
Anthony Taylor: So these numbers

953
01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:15.079
Anthony Taylor: are not that uncommon for regression.

954
01:28:16.810 --> 01:28:19.420
Anthony Taylor: Okay, regression's a tough one to do

955
01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:22.450
Anthony Taylor: questions.

956
01:28:23.730 --> 01:28:29.080
Anthony Taylor: But you should have got from that most important parts of this is

957
01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:38.850
Anthony Taylor: basically, if you're doing a hypothesis check or a statistical significance check right? It's this little section here.

958
01:28:39.390 --> 01:28:48.330
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you want to do this to see if anything falls into statistically significant. Nothing does. You're done.

959
01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:52.469
Anthony Taylor: If some do grab her.

960
01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:55.120
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

961
01:28:56.550 --> 01:28:57.380
Anthony Taylor: cool

962
01:28:59.630 --> 01:29:00.710
Anthony Taylor: everybody. Good.

963
01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:03.530
Anthony Taylor: Alright

964
01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:10.289
Anthony Taylor: now wants me to do another. Everyone do which is silly. But first we're going to do the lecture. Oh, wait, no, we're gonna take a break.

965
01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:13.310
Anthony Taylor: Almost forgot break Guy.

966
01:29:13.530 --> 01:29:17.799
Anthony Taylor: Oh, alright! We're doing so good. Come back up

967
01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:21.210
Anthony Taylor: 5.

968
01:29:22.100 --> 01:29:24.170
Anthony Taylor: Is that right? What time is it? Now?

969
01:29:26.530 --> 01:29:29.860
Anthony Taylor: Come back 35 min after the hour, whatever time that is.

970
01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:32.540
Anthony Taylor: I'll see you then.

971
01:29:35.690 --> 01:29:36.420
Masarirambi, Rodney: Thanks.

972
01:29:37.170 --> 01:29:38.559
Anthony Taylor: I'm telling you.

973
01:29:38.890 --> 01:29:41.040
michael mcpherson: I'll stick with hiring

974
01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:47.969
Anthony Taylor: a senior data engineer. I offered it to James and said, No. have to move to Florida.

975
01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:51.839
michael mcpherson: Okay, I'll move to Florida. That's a big issue

976
01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:58.259
Anthony Taylor: all right next.

977
01:29:58.300 --> 01:30:02.760
Anthony Taylor: Now I will tell you. Looking through everything. I think

978
01:30:04.270 --> 01:30:09.929
Anthony Taylor: I think we may or may not do the last section today. We might push that to tomorrow.

979
01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:20.369
Anthony Taylor:  just just because tomorrow we is a weird schedule. So we'll have time to do it, and there's no reason to keep

980
01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:22.650
Anthony Taylor: stacking stuff on your brains.

981
01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:27.569
Anthony Taylor: So right now we're gonna do multi covid year. And

982
01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:32.489
Anthony Taylor: I had to practice that word. I asked. Chat Gp. How to say it?

983
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:44.300
Anthony Taylor: No, I didn't. I actually can. So I can. I learned that once so multi-coliniarity. what is it?

984
01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:53.880
Anthony Taylor:  So we talked about so many different things with bias variance things that can mess up our models.

985
01:30:54.210 --> 01:30:58.350
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, bias, experience is

986
01:30:58.430 --> 01:31:00.980
Anthony Taylor: after the model has fit.

987
01:31:01.340 --> 01:31:02.990
Anthony Taylor: though the model's been trained.

988
01:31:03.490 --> 01:31:14.509
Anthony Taylor: and we're going to look at bias variants and see what's wrong. And we gave some strategies how to adjust for it. But multicollinearity is actually a pretty big problem.

989
01:31:14.670 --> 01:31:16.849
Anthony Taylor: What does it mean? Exactly

990
01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:18.110
Anthony Taylor: so

991
01:31:18.410 --> 01:31:20.159
as opposed to

992
01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:27.790
Anthony Taylor: how the data points get fit? This is more talking about the columns themselves.

993
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:35.460
Anthony Taylor: Let me give you a really easy one to understand. Let's say you have.

994
01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:39.140
Anthony Taylor: I had a great, I had a great example. I want to thank

995
01:31:39.180 --> 01:31:40.220
Anthony Taylor: wait.

996
01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:42.820
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

997
01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:50.999
Anthony Taylor: So you have weights in leaders. I know that's weird. But just it's English. What do you want? Weights in readers

998
01:31:51.170 --> 01:31:53.900
Anthony Taylor: and weight and gallons.

999
01:31:55.930 --> 01:31:57.230
Anthony Taylor: different numbers.

1000
01:31:57.610 --> 01:32:00.979
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Wouldn't be uncommon to see that in your data.

1001
01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:04.679
Anthony Taylor: but they mean the same thing

1002
01:32:06.570 --> 01:32:14.170
Anthony Taylor: alright. But they can throw off your model because they're different numbers. But they mean the same thing.

1003
01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:19.520
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So when you look at your data, you see something like this, it's like, Hey, I gotta get rid of that.

1004
01:32:20.530 --> 01:32:22.410
Anthony Taylor: So you would get rid of one of those

1005
01:32:22.530 --> 01:32:27.570
Anthony Taylor:  Other problems you might run into is like

1006
01:32:27.950 --> 01:32:34.720
Anthony Taylor: variables that are part of another. So like a column like, say, I'm a calculated column

1007
01:32:35.490 --> 01:32:40.860
Anthony Taylor: ratio of high school grads to

1008
01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:47.900
Anthony Taylor: senior class. But you also have senior class. like the number of students.

1009
01:32:49.870 --> 01:32:56.350
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you have that calculation. I mean you already, so that calculation is directly

1010
01:32:56.430 --> 01:33:03.730
Anthony Taylor: corresponding to that, or or let's go with our favorite work correlating

1011
01:33:05.110 --> 01:33:11.030
Anthony Taylor: to that data. So when you have 2 columns that exactly correlate together.

1012
01:33:12.150 --> 01:33:14.080
Anthony Taylor: typically, you only need one of.

1013
01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:18.750
Anthony Taylor: and that's multico in year.

1014
01:33:19.690 --> 01:33:30.689
Anthony Taylor: Okay, another example. And we briefly touched on this when we did one hot encoding right when we said, Drop the first

1015
01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:32.660
Anthony Taylor: option. You guys remember that

1016
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:35.479
Anthony Taylor: where we said, like, we have

1017
01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:46.270
Anthony Taylor: married or not married. And instead of having 2 columns, we would really just have one. Right? We had 2. You're going to run into a multicollinearity issue.

1018
01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:50.399
Anthony Taylor: Is it gonna make your model completely wrong? Yeah, probably not.

1019
01:33:51.950 --> 01:33:54.150
Anthony Taylor: But it could mess it up.

1020
01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:57.079
Anthony Taylor: So it's something to keep in mind.

1021
01:33:57.190 --> 01:34:06.970
Anthony Taylor: So causing bad use of dummy variables. That's the drop. The first one. The data set itself is not good for modeling. It needs some

1022
01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:12.050
Anthony Taylor: what you know. multiple features that contain the same data in different format.

1023
01:34:12.510 --> 01:34:19.170
Anthony Taylor: Okay, variables that are created from other features. And last, but not least, insufficient data.

1024
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:21.360
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1025
01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:25.359
Anthony Taylor: so we're going to talk about something called the various variants

1026
01:34:25.470 --> 01:34:26.950
Anthony Taylor: inflation

1027
01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:30.009
Anthony Taylor: factor. And what it does is it can

1028
01:34:30.050 --> 01:34:35.179
Anthony Taylor: check for us if we have a multicoline immunity problem.

1029
01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:48.010
Anthony Taylor: I was doing fine up until then. Okay. so the Vi app is one of the ways we check in the lowest value with one 0 correlation.

1030
01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:51.360
Anthony Taylor: That's what that means. Okay.

1031
01:34:51.480 --> 01:35:01.210
Anthony Taylor: the higher the yeah. Yeah. For a feature, the more likely it is to be contributing. So we're going to calculate it and take a look. And that's what we're going to do now.

1032
01:35:01.790 --> 01:35:06.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay. let's do it.

1033
01:35:08.010 --> 01:35:12.330
Anthony Taylor: Oh, it's in everyone, do. Hi. Well.

1034
01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:13.900
Anthony Taylor: then, let's do that.

1035
01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:17.160
So

1036
01:35:17.670 --> 01:35:19.109
Anthony Taylor: everyone do

1037
01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:27.060
Anthony Taylor: not sure why they made this one do it. But why not? Right?

1038
01:35:35.670 --> 01:35:39.670
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we're going to get all our stuff for linear regression. We're good.

1039
01:35:39.710 --> 01:35:50.099
Anthony Taylor: This is the same car data that we had earlier. So not much to say, There. we're going to copy the features like we did before by removing the price.

1040
01:35:50.230 --> 01:35:54.650
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to put the price into our target Y variable.

1041
01:35:55.230 --> 01:35:57.229
Anthony Taylor: We've done this few times today.

1042
01:35:57.240 --> 01:36:01.789
Anthony Taylor: We're not going to do all the all the other. We're just going to do a normal train test split.

1043
01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:03.850
Anthony Taylor: And

1044
01:36:03.910 --> 01:36:07.889
Anthony Taylor: now we're going to look at the variance inflation.

1045
01:36:08.210 --> 01:36:08.970
Anthony Taylor: Fact.

1046
01:36:09.970 --> 01:36:14.870
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so the way we're gonna do this is, we have this nifty little function.

1047
01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:17.940
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna make a data frame all fifth.

1048
01:36:18.270 --> 01:36:22.439
Anthony Taylor: we're going to get the variables from the column names.

1049
01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:29.070
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to execute very. And and and what is this guys what's happening here?

1050
01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:32.540
Anthony Taylor: We learned this like the first or second week.

1051
01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:36.279
Anthony Taylor: what is that

1052
01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:38.260
Dipinto, Matt: less comprehension.

1053
01:36:38.740 --> 01:36:39.840
Anthony Taylor: Thank you, Matt.

1054
01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:46.090
Anthony Taylor: list comprehension. So we're gonna create a list. We're gonna say, for

1055
01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:53.010
Anthony Taylor: range of X shape one, give me the inflation factor looking at all of the value.

1056
01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:55.760
Anthony Taylor: In this.

1057
01:36:57.330 --> 01:37:01.829
Anthony Taylor: in this, in this cop. Okay? And then we're going to return the value.

1058
01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:03.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

1059
01:37:03.210 --> 01:37:05.490
Anthony Taylor: So that's what we're going to do

1060
01:37:05.570 --> 01:37:08.620
Anthony Taylor: so. All we got to do is call this function

1061
01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:15.720
Anthony Taylor: that we just made passing X, and then we're gonna say, sort them

1062
01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:22.489
Anthony Taylor:  on the Vth, because it's going to return

1063
01:37:22.650 --> 01:37:23.690
Anthony Taylor: of this.

1064
01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:36.130
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we can run that. And here we can see what we got. Alright. You see, aspiration symboling blah blah blah. Now.

1065
01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:38.620
Anthony Taylor: let's look at

1066
01:37:42.850 --> 01:37:44.420
Anthony Taylor: engine location.

1067
01:37:46.270 --> 01:37:47.930
Anthony Taylor: This is interesting.

1068
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:51.860
Anthony Taylor: okay, so let's do X

1069
01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:56.349
Anthony Taylor: engine location. Let's run that

1070
01:37:56.530 --> 01:37:58.099
Anthony Taylor: and see what's up.

1071
01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:02.850
Anthony Taylor: Okay, actually, you know what that's not gonna help us. Let's do value counts.

1072
01:38:03.790 --> 01:38:06.930
Anthony Taylor: So engine location.

1073
01:38:12.110 --> 01:38:16.149
Anthony Taylor: So we have 159

1074
01:38:16.370 --> 01:38:17.910
Anthony Taylor: zeros.

1075
01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:21.229
Anthony Taylor: How many rows do we have all together.

1076
01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:25.559
Anthony Taylor: I don't know.

1077
01:38:25.710 --> 01:38:28.179
Dipinto, Matt: Drop in a it's a hundred 59.

1078
01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:31.389
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we have

1079
01:38:32.050 --> 01:38:39.400
Anthony Taylor: 159 rows. But they're all 0. So they're not doing us any good either. So let's

1080
01:38:40.010 --> 01:38:41.629
Anthony Taylor: let's get rid of that

1081
01:38:42.090 --> 01:38:46.210
Anthony Taylor:  But some other ones we want to get rid of

1082
01:38:47.730 --> 01:38:50.509
Anthony Taylor: the ones with the highest. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Score

1083
01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:57.369
Anthony Taylor: be with wheel-based link. Perfect. Thank you, Mike.

1084
01:38:57.660 --> 01:38:58.840
Anthony Taylor: absolutely.

1085
01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:04.850
Anthony Taylor: So for this, we're going to do.  X.

1086
01:39:06.170 --> 01:39:07.470
Anthony Taylor: Oh, yeah. Yay.

1087
01:39:07.830 --> 01:39:13.360
Anthony Taylor: x underscore V, and it was

1088
01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:14.700
Anthony Taylor: X,

1089
01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:16.140
that drop

1090
01:39:18.210 --> 01:39:25.579
Anthony Taylor: parentheses. We're gonna drop columns and the columns are gonna drop. We're gonna put in array. We're gonna drop engine

1091
01:39:27.210 --> 01:39:28.510
Anthony Taylor: location.

1092
01:39:31.460 --> 01:39:35.070
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna drop those ones. We say, if you want to get ahead with

1093
01:39:36.910 --> 01:39:38.280
Anthony Taylor: wheel-based

1094
01:39:43.090 --> 01:39:44.090
Anthony Taylor: length

1095
01:39:46.290 --> 01:39:47.590
Anthony Taylor: and height.

1096
01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:51.050
Anthony Taylor: okay?

1097
01:39:51.310 --> 01:39:59.589
Anthony Taylor: And then we're gonna recalculate our scores. So we're just gonna run our calculate. And this time we're gonna pass an XV,

1098
01:40:02.140 --> 01:40:04.319
Anthony Taylor: because you have to. Every. So

1099
01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:07.590
Anthony Taylor: it's important to understand that.

1100
01:40:10.860 --> 01:40:15.470
Anthony Taylor: Well, let me ask, ask you this one. why do I need to recalculate this?

1101
01:40:18.580 --> 01:40:23.179
michael mcpherson: Because you taken out columns that would skew the data

1102
01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:31.089
Anthony Taylor: 100% accurate. Thank you, Mike. So basically, this is basically comparing the columns to each other.

1103
01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:32.430
Anthony Taylor: Right?

1104
01:40:32.590 --> 01:40:41.190
Anthony Taylor: So we have. We have just removed 1, 2, or 5 of them. So now, we have a different output

1105
01:40:41.300 --> 01:40:43.090
Anthony Taylor: than what we had before.

1106
01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:49.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so again, we're gonna look at our data and figure out what we want to do with this.

1107
01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:51.030
Anthony Taylor: So

1108
01:40:52.080 --> 01:41:03.780
Anthony Taylor: right now. I mean, we still have a lot of stuff we probably don't need. But let's go ahead and and move forward with this. So we have X underscore full

1109
01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:05.690
Anthony Taylor: underscore train

1110
01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:07.910
Anthony Taylor: comma X

1111
01:41:08.140 --> 01:41:10.690
Anthony Taylor: underscore full. Add to score tab.

1112
01:41:10.890 --> 01:41:11.800
Anthony Taylor: I'm a

1113
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:15.640
Anthony Taylor: X underscore V underscore train.

1114
01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:21.569
Anthony Taylor: and I want to say, while I'm attempting to type all of this out in the fastest way possible.

1115
01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:25.520
Anthony Taylor:  you could definitely go further with this

1116
01:41:26.470 --> 01:41:29.050
Anthony Taylor: all right. These numbers are still pretty high.

1117
01:41:30.420 --> 01:41:44.030
Anthony Taylor: so we could. We could probably lower this down even more to a smaller set. I mean, there, there just isn't. There? Isn't a you know.

1118
01:41:44.300 --> 01:41:45.969
Anthony Taylor: the lower the better.

1119
01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:52.129
Anthony Taylor: So you could like like this is really highly. Maybe you could decide. But

1120
01:41:53.770 --> 01:42:00.020
Anthony Taylor: we're doing this like, I mean again for linear regression. This is almost too simple. But we're doing this normally.

1121
01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:01.190
Anthony Taylor: You would

1122
01:42:01.230 --> 01:42:07.200
Anthony Taylor: like maybe run it with like this, and then maybe run it, make a cut off it like here.

1123
01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:13.049
Anthony Taylor: Sorry here. and then check it again right? If you lost

1124
01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:19.790
Anthony Taylor: score, then you would go back up if you gained. If it got better maybe go up again.

1125
01:42:20.140 --> 01:42:23.530
Anthony Taylor: I mean, look at these. This is the biggest jump right here.

1126
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:27.100
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So maybe that's what you need.

1127
01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:33.530
Anthony Taylor: But it's it, really, you know, going back to what I always say. It's it's it's iterative.

1128
01:42:33.670 --> 01:42:36.020
Anthony Taylor: You just try different things.

1129
01:42:36.530 --> 01:42:39.829
And we're just giving you lots of things that you can try.

1130
01:42:40.150 --> 01:42:45.329
Anthony Taylor: Do you have to do this? No, you don't. So you would. You would drop the the columns.

1131
01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:49.160
Clayton Graves: You would run the the the split test

1132
01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:50.959
Clayton Graves: on what was last.

1133
01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:56.610
Clayton Graves: and then, yes. maybe drop some more columns, run it again. May compare

1134
01:42:57.250 --> 01:43:02.070
Anthony Taylor: you absolutely could do that. Yeah. And like I said the the thing about

1135
01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:10.930
Anthony Taylor: data science, it's iterations. It's doing it again and again and again, until you get exactly.

1136
01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:16.260
Anthony Taylor: And you know what you're never gonna get exactly what you want. Do you get what is accepted?

1137
01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:24.640
Anthony Taylor: Okay, rarely. Do you get exactly. I mean, because you would love the perfect model that doesn't write every title.

1138
01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:30.079
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I've seen some very good models

1139
01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:31.960
Anthony Taylor: perfect. Yeah.

1140
01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:35.979
Anthony Taylor: there's always some error.

1141
01:43:36.490 --> 01:43:40.760
Anthony Taylor: The question is, is, is it acceptable? And most of the time it is.

1142
01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:44.300
Anthony Taylor: So it's all good.

1143
01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:52.839
Anthony Taylor: So all I'm doing same thing we did earlier. We're just creating 2

1144
01:43:53.330 --> 01:43:55.590
Anthony Taylor: so we can compare

1145
01:43:56.690 --> 01:43:59.800
Anthony Taylor: our our stuff

1146
01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:01.010
Anthony Taylor: oops.

1147
01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:16.089
Anthony Taylor: And then there's our adjusted function. And then, last, but not least.

1148
01:44:17.180 --> 01:44:18.899
Anthony Taylor: through our scores.

1149
01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:24.670
score one

1150
01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:32.260
Anthony Taylor: equals R, 2 underscore. Just passing our test data

1151
01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:36.540
Anthony Taylor: par y test.

1152
01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:39.329
Anthony Taylor: And our mom.

1153
01:44:42.700 --> 01:44:45.529
Anthony Taylor: I could've just copied this from the last, almost

1154
01:45:16.090 --> 01:45:17.869
Anthony Taylor: everybody following. What I'm doing.

1155
01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:22.280
Anthony Taylor: All we're doing now is just printing it all out.

1156
01:45:30.430 --> 01:45:33.139
Anthony Taylor: Did I spell it wrong? I did. Adf.

1157
01:45:33.220 --> 01:45:41.089
Anthony Taylor: you guys know how many times I say, adf in a day like 100. Okay, so as you can see here.

1158
01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:46.990
Anthony Taylor: Got a pretty low score there, but by running the less columns again

1159
01:45:47.730 --> 01:45:49.210
Anthony Taylor: we got a better school.

1160
01:45:49.990 --> 01:45:55.749
Anthony Taylor: So I mean, yeah, we could keep doing this, you could keep grinding through this

1161
01:45:55.860 --> 01:45:58.920
Anthony Taylor: totally something we could do.

1162
01:46:00.090 --> 01:46:05.800
Clayton Graves: Oh, that that at that point I would probably cut off the 600.

1163
01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:07.810
Clayton Graves: Try it again. Yeah.

1164
01:46:09.490 --> 01:46:12.299
Clayton Graves: see if the okay.

1165
01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:18.800
Anthony Taylor: no, that's good. Clayton, that's really good. That's exactly what you what you should do.

1166
01:46:19.410 --> 01:46:20.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1167
01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:24.160
Anthony Taylor: alright.

1168
01:46:27.750 --> 01:46:32.080
Anthony Taylor: We still have like 40 min. So all right, we are. Gonna do the last one after

1169
01:46:34.590 --> 01:46:47.339
Anthony Taylor: I think we will. Might as well be done with it. Maybe I'll come up with something fun for tomorrow. All right. Regular day. Look for the braces. Regular day shit.

1170
01:46:48.290 --> 01:46:49.310
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

1171
01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:57.450
Anthony Taylor:  it's a technique used to address overfitting or variants

1172
01:46:57.850 --> 01:47:07.140
Anthony Taylor: specifically in regression models. Okay, so here's our model. We could see everything. Everything's good.

1173
01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:18.089
Anthony Taylor: Right? This is how linear regression does its thing. We have other models like bridge regression.

1174
01:47:18.330 --> 01:47:22.500
Anthony Taylor: What is Ridge regression? Well, it's just another model.

1175
01:47:22.940 --> 01:47:29.750
Anthony Taylor: Okay, notice, we didn't even show you the cool function here. We could show you the cool function here. We're not showing you the cool function.

1176
01:47:30.570 --> 01:47:40.769
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's another mo. but this model. It minimizes the sum of their residuals. And it penalizes for large coefficients.

1177
01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:45.889
Anthony Taylor: Okay, here's here. It is. Ridge penalty equals alpha times. Sum of third coefficients.

1178
01:47:49.730 --> 01:47:50.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1179
01:47:52.030 --> 01:47:59.519
Anthony Taylor: lasso is another regression model very similar to linear

1180
01:48:00.190 --> 01:48:06.250
Anthony Taylor: but it minimizes the sum of squared residuals and penalizes large coefficients.

1181
01:48:09.140 --> 01:48:14.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay. you're probably like, I don't get it. Don't worry about it. Alright, not yet.

1182
01:48:15.770 --> 01:48:20.440
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And then boom, we're connected. So what does all that mean?

1183
01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:34.660
Anthony Taylor: Bottom line is this linear regression models when used

1184
01:48:37.030 --> 01:48:40.699
Anthony Taylor: and the data fits them. And notice how I said that.

1185
01:48:41.230 --> 01:48:44.709
Anthony Taylor: Okay. the data fits linear regression.

1186
01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:48.400
Anthony Taylor: Normally, we say the model fits the data. But

1187
01:48:50.030 --> 01:48:55.390
Anthony Taylor: if you're going to use like multilinear regression. you want to make sure the data fits it.

1188
01:48:55.670 --> 01:49:05.509
Anthony Taylor: And all these techniques we've kind of gone through will lead you to that.  and that's that. But

1189
01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:15.259
Anthony Taylor: occasionally you're like, Dang it. I know this should work with linear regress. but it's still not coming out great.

1190
01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:19.219
Anthony Taylor: In that case you can use bridge

1191
01:49:19.510 --> 01:49:21.640
Anthony Taylor: or lasso.

1192
01:49:22.750 --> 01:49:27.439
Anthony Taylor: and the beauty of it is, you only have to change one step.

1193
01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:30.900
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so

1194
01:49:31.070 --> 01:49:34.179
Anthony Taylor: let's go look at that. So here, you see, we've got

1195
01:49:35.110 --> 01:49:41.519
Anthony Taylor: everything's the same except notice. Now instead of linear regression, we have Ridge.

1196
01:49:42.650 --> 01:49:43.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1197
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:46.240
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna

1198
01:49:46.370 --> 01:49:49.669
Anthony Taylor: this is just going to make some data for us, make it easy

1199
01:49:49.680 --> 01:50:05.839
Anthony Taylor: train test. Split it. We're going to do standard scalar. Okay? And now our model ridge. Okay, the alpha of one feel free to look that up. And then it's X train transformed, and then y train.

1200
01:50:06.390 --> 01:50:07.899
Anthony Taylor: we've ran our model.

1201
01:50:09.050 --> 01:50:12.679
Anthony Taylor: We run a predict and we check our mean, squared error.

1202
01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:20.189
Anthony Taylor: Maybe it's good. Maybe it's not. So. Let's see if we can get a model that score out of this.

1203
01:50:25.670 --> 01:50:26.969
Anthony Taylor: Oh, duh.

1204
01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:42.490
Anthony Taylor: actually.

1205
01:50:44.050 --> 01:50:46.470
Anthony Taylor: you did a split. So let's grab it this way.

1206
01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:03.769
Anthony Taylor: There we go. So that's pretty damn good. But we don't even know because we can't see the date.

1207
01:51:04.090 --> 01:51:07.250
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so

1208
01:51:08.380 --> 01:51:11.009
Clayton Graves: is that pretty good? Or is that overfitted?

1209
01:51:11.650 --> 01:51:21.650
Anthony Taylor: Well it. This is the test. right? So when your test comes out, that good that's pretty good. But to be honest with you.

1210
01:51:21.660 --> 01:51:24.579
Anthony Taylor: I mean, this data could be like super

1211
01:51:24.590 --> 01:51:25.650
Anthony Taylor: fantastic.

1212
01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:32.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you never know, cause it's been generated by by sk, learn. So

1213
01:51:32.290 --> 01:51:35.990
Anthony Taylor: it's it's meant to be easy.

1214
01:51:36.430 --> 01:51:46.840
Anthony Taylor: Now, this bugs me a little bit. But okay.  I promise you we are going to go over this in more detail later.

1215
01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:48.830
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

1216
01:51:52.570 --> 01:51:54.530
Anthony Taylor: what this does

1217
01:51:56.010 --> 01:52:01.670
Anthony Taylor: is it's going to run the model with a different variable

1218
01:52:02.970 --> 01:52:08.920
Anthony Taylor: each time. So there is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1219
01:52:10.220 --> 01:52:17.979
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to run this method. It's going to load these 5 into it, and then we're going to say fit. And it's going to run this model

1220
01:52:18.420 --> 01:52:22.439
Anthony Taylor: 5 times. changing the alpha value

1221
01:52:23.570 --> 01:52:24.709
Anthony Taylor: each time.

1222
01:52:26.370 --> 01:52:32.649
Anthony Taylor: So we call this hyper parameter tuning. We're gonna do a lot of this later.

1223
01:52:33.410 --> 01:52:38.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I don't know why they kind of snuck it in here. But let's take a look.

1224
01:52:39.510 --> 01:52:43.359
Anthony Taylor: We ran it. We can look at the alpha that it liked.

1225
01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:47.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so this is the one that they said was the best.

1226
01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:52.420
Anthony Taylor: All right of the 5. This was the best one.

1227
01:52:54.070 --> 01:52:54.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

1228
01:52:55.620 --> 01:53:00.309
Anthony Taylor: And so now we can go rerun this again with that setting

1229
01:53:01.550 --> 01:53:06.320
Anthony Taylor: and take a look. And actually we'll do score again.

1230
01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:20.920
Anthony Taylor:  and we'll see. 9, 6, 7, 6, 6, 7, 5.

1231
01:53:21.650 --> 01:53:25.059
Anthony Taylor: Actually. Wait. Say.

1232
01:53:25.530 --> 01:53:29.959
Dipinto, Matt: so. Let's look at our yeah. Let's look at our. You didn't change the model.

1233
01:53:30.170 --> 01:53:32.459
Dipinto, Matt: It's Model 2 that is fitted now.

1234
01:53:34.140 --> 01:53:36.770
Anthony Taylor: Oh. thank you.

1235
01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:41.380
Anthony Taylor: thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's like damn alright!

1236
01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:42.590
Anthony Taylor: There you go!

1237
01:53:42.730 --> 01:53:50.670
Anthony Taylor: Did it improve by a lot? No little bit. Okay. But remember, this could be like, really smooth, clean data.

1238
01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:58.439
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so don't get too hung up on that. But the bottom line is is we Ran Ridge.

1239
01:54:00.060 --> 01:54:05.030
Anthony Taylor: If you wanted to run lasso here. you would just change

1240
01:54:07.330 --> 01:54:08.020
Anthony Taylor: pact.

1241
01:54:09.820 --> 01:54:11.200
Anthony Taylor: Just change the last

1242
01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:13.599
Anthony Taylor: and import Lhasa. That's it.

1243
01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:17.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And everything works.

1244
01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:20.419
Raugewitz, Tania: So it's just model equals

1245
01:54:20.440 --> 01:54:21.600
Raugewitz, Tania: lasso.

1246
01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:29.200
Anthony Taylor: Right? So you say model equals lasso. See? And if there's a parameter, maybe that plug in there?

1247
01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:41.149
Anthony Taylor: And the answer is, no. I'm actually surprised they didn't give you that example. seeing if you have to do it in the next 1 1 s.

1248
01:54:41.290 --> 01:54:42.040
Raugewitz, Tania: You do.

1249
01:54:43.930 --> 01:54:46.340
Masarirambi, Rodney: Oh, they ask you to do lasso. And the next one

1250
01:54:46.740 --> 01:54:54.209
Anthony Taylor: just believe, yeah, okay, there is an alpha. It lasts up also. So you know what? Here, let's just see.

1251
01:54:54.810 --> 01:54:58.530
Anthony Taylor: I love that buddy. I love Ted Last at all.

1252
01:54:59.350 --> 01:55:04.749
Anthony Taylor: He's my favorite. Okay? So if you just did lasso there

1253
01:55:06.690 --> 01:55:08.269
Anthony Taylor: and lasso here.

1254
01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:13.389
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then you could just rerun this one, this one.

1255
01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:17.010
Anthony Taylor: this one. this one. this one.

1256
01:55:18.090 --> 01:55:19.200
Anthony Taylor: this one

1257
01:55:19.590 --> 01:55:21.880
Anthony Taylor: and this one.

1258
01:55:22.340 --> 01:55:23.250
Anthony Taylor: There you go.

1259
01:55:25.970 --> 01:55:27.670
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's it.

1260
01:55:28.150 --> 01:55:29.010
Anthony Taylor: So

1261
01:55:30.580 --> 01:55:34.399
Anthony Taylor: I'm not gonna challenge you guys, maybe tomorrow I'll challenge you guys with this.

1262
01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:37.579
Anthony Taylor: This could have been done in a function.

1263
01:55:38.590 --> 01:55:40.860
Anthony Taylor: And you could have just passed the model in

1264
01:55:43.230 --> 01:55:48.469
Anthony Taylor: all right single cell bam call the function passing the new model

1265
01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:52.790
Anthony Taylor: might be fun to play with. Okay. alright.

1266
01:55:54.140 --> 01:55:58.290
Anthony Taylor: So I mean, honestly, guys, what do I want you to learn from this?

1267
01:55:58.340 --> 01:56:02.390
Anthony Taylor: There are 2 other linear regression models. That's it.

1268
01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:09.219
Anthony Taylor: Ridge, Lhasa. What do they use. It depends on your data. If the coefficients are very high.

1269
01:56:09.650 --> 01:56:15.429
Anthony Taylor: then go ahead and try them out. See if they work better. You just want to try them out, and it's a fast train.

1270
01:56:15.550 --> 01:56:16.610
Anthony Taylor: Try it out.

1271
01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:19.370
Anthony Taylor: They work better, use them.

1272
01:56:20.410 --> 01:56:24.289
Anthony Taylor: The cool thing is, since Ridge and Alaska are are

1273
01:56:24.410 --> 01:56:26.170
Anthony Taylor: very tunable.

1274
01:56:28.100 --> 01:56:32.159
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you can actually tune them to work better.

1275
01:56:34.410 --> 01:56:35.380
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1276
01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:39.069
Anthony Taylor: I'm looking forward to giving you guys this later.

1277
01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:44.509
Anthony Taylor: But for right now I'll just go with this. And there is a lasso CD also.

1278
01:56:48.380 --> 01:56:51.950
Anthony Taylor: so you could do the same thing that you did here just with this one instead.

1279
01:56:53.180 --> 01:56:54.960
Anthony Taylor: Alright. hi!

1280
01:56:56.300 --> 01:56:57.600
Anthony Taylor: Pretty

1281
01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:04.459
Anthony Taylor: straight, for I know. And and I know this drive some of you crazy that we don't get into this like great

1282
01:57:04.670 --> 01:57:17.670
Anthony Taylor: detail. What's rich? What's last up? It's a linear regression model for the rest of machine learning guys. we're out of the simple stuff. Okay. we're not going to get into.

1283
01:57:17.700 --> 01:57:23.949
Anthony Taylor: In fact, I don't even know that you will ever need to know exactly how all these models work.

1284
01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:27.440
Anthony Taylor: what you need to know when to use them.

1285
01:57:27.460 --> 01:57:28.829
Anthony Taylor: how to tune them.

1286
01:57:30.300 --> 01:57:32.670
Anthony Taylor: You could ask a hundred data. Scientists.

1287
01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:37.320
Anthony Taylor: Maybe 2 of them are gonna know how they work.

1288
01:57:37.730 --> 01:57:47.920
Anthony Taylor: but they are going to know exactly how to use them and how to tune them. That's where you guys need to be. Okay.

1289
01:57:48.060 --> 01:57:51.340
Anthony Taylor: but feel free. I mean, if you want to go Chat Gp, this.

1290
01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:56.569
Anthony Taylor: I encourage you to do. So Google, it chat. DVD, it, whatever you want.

1291
01:57:57.040 --> 01:57:58.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I

1292
01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:05.170
Anthony Taylor: I care about all of you and your learning. but I don't care what Rich does or how it doesn't.

1293
01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:13.930
Anthony Taylor: I know when to use it and how to. Okay, there's like, you're gonna find out. There's thousands

1294
01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:24.879
Anthony Taylor: of machine learning models. thousands and new ones come up all the freaking time you lose your mind trying to keep up with all.

1295
01:58:25.490 --> 01:58:40.430
Anthony Taylor: Okay, nobody does. Okay. at least all of it. They may keep up with some alright. So you're gonna do a ridge just like we did in the example.  and they're gonna have you do the hyper tuning, which is cool.

1296
01:58:41.520 --> 01:58:45.520
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then do a regular linear regression

1297
01:58:46.110 --> 01:58:47.680
Anthony Taylor: and then do a Lhasa.

1298
01:58:48.380 --> 01:58:54.340
Anthony Taylor: Wow! That's a lot time to give you for this 5 min. Nope, wrong? One sorry

1299
01:58:55.470 --> 01:58:56.660
Anthony Taylor: 20 min.

1300
01:58:56.820 --> 01:58:58.909
Anthony Taylor: which is perfect. Alright gang

1301
01:58:59.470 --> 01:59:03.969
Anthony Taylor: one a minute minutes to make this make sense.

1302
01:59:06.750 --> 01:59:09.469
Anthony Taylor: How'd you guys do with it? Was it a problem at all?

1303
01:59:10.930 --> 01:59:17.030
Anthony Taylor: Not really. Okay. Well, we'll still go through. So

1304
01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:35.500
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna bring in Ridge. That's the only new one. Bring in some data, real estate evaluation exciting. We're gonna drop the house price of unit area. So that's our target variable.

1305
01:59:35.720 --> 01:59:37.309
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're gonna

1306
01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:40.689
Anthony Taylor: put everything in the feet in the X and then

1307
01:59:40.860 --> 01:59:47.619
Anthony Taylor: house price of unit area in? Why. what do we got? 415 rows, 6 columns.

1308
01:59:48.750 --> 01:59:49.939
Anthony Taylor: Pretty exciting.

1309
01:59:50.980 --> 01:59:52.840
Anthony Taylor: Alright trade test. Split

1310
01:59:53.110 --> 01:59:55.590
Anthony Taylor: nothing new there scale and fit

1311
01:59:55.680 --> 01:59:57.150
Anthony Taylor: nothing new there.

1312
01:59:57.210 --> 02:00:01.089
Anthony Taylor: And now we do ridge. So we're using alpha one.

1313
02:00:01.170 --> 02:00:05.800
Anthony Taylor: We're doing our scaled data. And

1314
02:00:06.960 --> 02:00:11.320
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna we have to always have to scale their test data the same way.

1315
02:00:11.490 --> 02:00:18.320
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to do a predict and do the mean, squared error. I don't know why they're not doing models for whatever.

1316
02:00:18.460 --> 02:00:23.049
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we just remember what what is a good, mean, squared error, bigger or smaller.

1317
02:00:27.640 --> 02:00:30.329
Dipinto, Matt: See a lot of miles movement. Thank you, Matt.

1318
02:00:30.450 --> 02:00:37.279
Anthony Taylor: alright. So we don't know. This is smaller yet. But when we compare it to our next model, we can decide.

1319
02:00:37.670 --> 02:00:41.400
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So here we have

1320
02:00:41.590 --> 02:00:48.220
Anthony Taylor: our alphas! We're gonna cycle through. Do all of them get the best

1321
02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:50.800
Anthony Taylor: alpha

1322
02:00:50.970 --> 02:00:58.099
Anthony Taylor: value, which is actually 10 for this one interesting hold on to that thought.

1323
02:00:58.260 --> 02:01:03.380
Anthony Taylor: Now, let's just do regular linear regression. Check this out one cell bam.

1324
02:01:04.170 --> 02:01:12.379
Anthony Taylor: No reason to do a whole bunch of stuff here. We can see the Mcs by the Msp. So this one's slightly better.

1325
02:01:13.010 --> 02:01:15.180
Anthony Taylor: right? Just slightly.

1326
02:01:15.770 --> 02:01:18.480
Anthony Taylor: And then last, we'll do lasso

1327
02:01:18.830 --> 02:01:24.940
Anthony Taylor: same as the one up above, except for its lasso instead of bridge, we could look at the coefficients.

1328
02:01:25.150 --> 02:01:34.039
Anthony Taylor: Interesting can take a look at the prediction. The mean squared. And this was the worst of the 3.

1329
02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:37.500
Anthony Taylor: Everybody see why, it's the worst of the 3.

1330
02:01:40.540 --> 02:01:41.830
Anthony Taylor: That's it, guys.

1331
02:01:43.110 --> 02:01:44.000
Anthony Taylor: So

1332
02:01:44.730 --> 02:01:49.720
Anthony Taylor: when so we're gonna do one more thing with regression. Tomorrow,

1333
02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:54.709
Anthony Taylor: I'll move for a quick second.

1334
02:01:56.290 --> 02:01:57.880
Anthony Taylor: Right? Well.

1335
02:01:58.620 --> 02:02:02.000
Anthony Taylor: what we're gonna do tomorrow with regression is we're gonna create a pipeline

1336
02:02:02.210 --> 02:02:09.129
Anthony Taylor: so that what you would do is you'd basically pass in data, and it would run the whole thing all in one pass.

1337
02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:12.460
Anthony Taylor: Very, very cool, very valuable stuff.

1338
02:02:12.740 --> 02:02:18.149
Anthony Taylor:  so that's the main goal of tomorrow. So as far as models go, we're deaf.

1339
02:02:18.690 --> 02:02:20.359
Anthony Taylor: You got linear regression

1340
02:02:21.070 --> 02:02:27.820
Anthony Taylor: for a single line X and Y, you've got linear regression for multi-line. Same one just multiple lines.

1341
02:02:28.020 --> 02:02:30.110
Anthony Taylor: You've got Ridge, and you've got less.

1342
02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:47.270
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Those are the important models that we should have picked up in regression. You should understand what regression does, what it's used for continuous variables. Alright. And we did some other cool things. We got trained to split. We did some encoding

1343
02:02:47.490 --> 02:02:54.759
Anthony Taylor:  those things, scaling, encoding, paying test, split and scoring.

1344
02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:57.850
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna do in every

1345
02:02:58.370 --> 02:02:59.969
Anthony Taylor: type of machine learning.

1346
02:03:01.190 --> 02:03:03.190
Anthony Taylor: So you'll get lots of practice at that.

1347
02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:10.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay, since there is no homework for this section. There's nothing for me to tell you to watch out for. Just

1348
02:03:10.580 --> 02:03:22.780
Anthony Taylor: remember those 3 models. Do they need a regression or do regression. Okay. cool guys have a great night. I will see you tomorrow. It'll be exciting.

1349
02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:24.110
Anthony Taylor: Heffer.
