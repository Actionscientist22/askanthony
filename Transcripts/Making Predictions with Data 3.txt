00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.769
Anthony Taylor: Hi! Currie! Welcome back!

2
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.570
Anthony Taylor: I didn't pick on Curry when he wasn't here.

3
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.460
Anthony Taylor: all right. So

4
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.810
Anthony Taylor: so

5
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:38.360
Anthony Taylor: we have spent the last 2 days of class preparing for one thing and one thing only. and that is problem

6
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.900
Anthony Taylor: time series, forecasting with profit before we go any further, though I must introduce our

7
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.710
Anthony Taylor: are super cool. TA. Sub alberto.

8
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.449
Anthony Taylor: Hey, Alberto, you want to introduce yourself. Alberto. Real quick.

9
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.070
Alberto Aigner: Yeah. Sure.

10
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.140
Raugewitz, Tania: So my name is Alberto.

11
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.129
Alberto Aigner: recent

12
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:15.230
Alberto Aigner: ta for data, analytics, bookcam. And I'm transitioning to the AI cool stuff kind of thing. So

13
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.909
Alberto Aigner: you might see me again if

14
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:26.129
Alberto Aigner: some of you guys of the other tas are not available. I'll be happy to join and yeah, and help

15
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.639
Alberto Aigner: in this little journey of yours.

16
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.790
Anthony Taylor: You go. Thank you, Alberto. Welcome.

17
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.360
Alberto Aigner: thank you.

18
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:45.970
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So what are we gonna do today? Well, we're gonna do some of this. We're gonna do some of that.  sorry

19
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.239
Anthony Taylor: we are going to use profit.

20
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.860
Anthony Taylor: And we're going to use it

21
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.020
Anthony Taylor: a lot, almost every activity.

22
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.689
Anthony Taylor: What you're gonna find with profit is, it has some interesting

23
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:08.290
Anthony Taylor: outputs. We're going to talk about those outputs and focus on what you need to understand. But do understand, there's a lot there. We're not. Gonna

24
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.750
Anthony Taylor: and we're gonna apply some time series forecasting models, using you guessed it

25
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:16.630
profit?

26
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Anthony Taylor:  So that's that

27
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.840
Anthony Taylor: time to predict the future. So we've done linear regression. Linear regression was kind of interesting.

28
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.400
Anthony Taylor: very simple.

29
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:39.290
Anthony Taylor: Okay, almost silly simple. This is as far from linear regression as you could possibly go.

30
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.620
Anthony Taylor: This is incredibly complex. Black box. Amazing stuff.

31
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.600
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

32
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:55.110
Anthony Taylor: Not sure why we jump so far so quick. But that's okay. It's a great intro as it's pretty simple to use.

33
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.399
Anthony Taylor: So I'm excited to show it to you today. Very excited

34
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.479
this is not one that I've used very much. So it was exciting for me to

35
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.180
Anthony Taylor: really get a look at it and learn it myself. Learn it much deeper than I'm going to show you. But learn it just the same.

36
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.999
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to create the model. We we're going to model fit. Predict.

37
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:29.310
Anthony Taylor: Those are the 3 words I want you to remember until we're done with machine learning model fit. Predict. Okay. so what we're gonna do. So

38
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:42.079
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna be all in Google colab today. Just so you know.  so they have in sample predictions. And so this is something that we're going to make

39
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:55.680
Anthony Taylor: today. And and this is not something we usually do in Ml, though it would be cool if we did in sample predictions are predictions that we make. So basically predictions that we make based on the training date.

40
00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.350
Anthony Taylor: So we look at the training data and we go. Let's make a couple of in sample predictions.

41
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.060
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

42
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:16.960
Anthony Taylor: so we like erase. And and what's that mean? That means we erase the actual data and then put our prediction over it. so we can see what we would have predicted had we predicted those States. Does that make sense?

43
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:27.439
Anthony Taylor: Let me give you an example. We use data from 2,020 till November 30. And we train our mom.

44
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.119
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But we have data through December fifteenth.

45
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:39.770
Anthony Taylor: Now, what we're gonna do is show our predictions through December fifteenth

46
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.720
Anthony Taylor: and compare the actual value to our predictive value

47
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.060
Anthony Taylor: in sample.

48
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.300
Anthony Taylor: Got it out of sample.

49
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.370
Anthony Taylor: We're going to extend our data frame

50
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.200
Anthony Taylor: to January 15, 2,024

51
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.010
Anthony Taylor: daily.

52
00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.859
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so one day, one row for every day. And now we're gonna tell the model to predict

53
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.089
Anthony Taylor: everything up to that day.

54
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:16.090
Anthony Taylor: Okay, which is pretty pretty amazing. Right? Because, remember, this is time series data. So this is like stock data sales data. This is some pretty cool data.

55
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.330
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

56
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:25.180
Anthony Taylor: any questions about that. I don't know that there was enough info. We really have a lot of questions on that. But if there are now

57
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.220
Anthony Taylor: nay.

58
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:34.249
Anthony Taylor: then, let's go. Look at me showing you this. So remember again, we're going to be in Google pro lab today.

59
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.950
Anthony Taylor: So everybody go to Google, Colab.

60
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:52.990
Anthony Taylor: upload and go to the instructor folder for this first activity. Grab yourself.

61
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:15.639
Anthony Taylor: So everybody should be here. You only need to do this like once a day. By the way. are once tonight, so go ahead and install it first time. It's probably already there. You don't have to worry about it.

62
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:22.210
Anthony Taylor: but just get it in the rest of the day you could just comment that line out you don't need there, see, it's already satisfied.

63
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.680
Anthony Taylor: We don't need that. So we're just gonna comment that out going forward. Okay.

64
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.570
Anthony Taylor: alright. Go to import pandas datetime profit.

65
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.080
Anthony Taylor: We gotta wait for the install to finish.

66
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:41.630
Anthony Taylor: There we go.

67
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:48.900
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So this next thing we showed you this the other day, we didn't use it. Let me show you what it's for when you run this.

68
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.430
Anthony Taylor: Sorry.

69
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:57.099
Anthony Taylor: That's the import. When you run the the and use it, it's going to ask you to choose a file.

70
00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:06.390
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to go and pick the hourly grid prices from our resources folder. So you do choose file.

71
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:13.300
Anthony Taylor: And now you're back in your activities. Go to resources and grab the hourly grid price, Dsm

72
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.820
Anthony Taylor: and open.

73
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.960
Anthony Taylor: So all this does is upload that file

74
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.830
Anthony Taylor: into our environment.

75
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay. once we have it.

76
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.169
Anthony Taylor: And if you need me to pause, I can go slower.

77
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.039
Anthony Taylor: Slow down. Sec, Christine, I gotcha

78
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:36.580
Anthony Taylor: tell me if you need help.

79
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:48.379
Anthony Taylor: This is another day. We got a pretty good amount of time. Go ahead. Sorry, can you? Just go over where when you get to that button and you hit it next to upload. Choose, file.

80
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.360
Anthony Taylor: I don't think it'll let me. Oh, wait a

81
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:58.050
Anthony Taylor: let me see if they let me do it again. Yeah, so choose files, and then you're in here in the south folder.

82
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.960
Anthony Taylor: Click up. Go to. O, one

83
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:07.830
Kanouff, Christine: resources. Yeah, II understand how to get like I'm not getting. I'm not getting a little.

84
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:16.090
Kanouff, Christine: Choose the choose style button. Are you in the right cell? Are you in the uploaded cell, the one below

85
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.340
Kanouff, Christine: block? The data? Yeah.

86
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.820
Kanouff, Christine: Let me just maybe I didn't import the file above it.

87
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.129
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Christine, did you hit play for that cell?

88
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:28.320
Kanouff, Christine: Yeah.

89
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.870
Anthony Taylor: Go ahead and share with me. Let me see what you got.

90
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.350
Kanouff, Christine: And

91
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.420
Kanouff, Christine: so I'm doing that here. Correct click, that. Yeah.

92
00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.159
Anthony Taylor: wait. What is that? Let's click it normal.

93
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.940
Anthony Taylor: There you go alright. Move your mouse.

94
00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:11.610
Anthony Taylor: There we go. Sorry I missed it. Yeah, no, you're fine. Make sure that works

95
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.110
Anthony Taylor: and then go up one. Yeah.

96
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:15.490
Anthony Taylor: Nope.

97
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:19.800
Anthony Taylor: go to. O, one. Yeah. Resource perfect. You got it

98
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.410
Anthony Taylor: awesome. No worries.

99
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.020
Anthony Taylor: That's what we're here for.

100
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:29.030
Anthony Taylor: Okay, guys keep going to the wrong screen.

101
00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.029
Anthony Taylor: They need to be in your screen up here.

102
00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:36.070
Mason, Natalie: Okay?

103
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.110
Mason, Natalie: Oh, Natalie, show us

104
00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.469
Mason, Natalie: that I'm gonna start over.

105
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:46.179
Mason, Natalie: No starting over. I wanna see what you got.

106
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:51.090
Mason, Natalie: Okay. I'm just re-looking it share screen. Here we go.

107
00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.730
Mason, Natalie: Okay.

108
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.370
Mason, Natalie: So from here.

109
00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:56.700
Mason, Natalie: Yeah, I know.

110
00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.370
Anthony Taylor: Go to file. upload.

111
00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.930
Anthony Taylor: upload browse

112
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:09.820
Mason, Natalie: is I don't know if that's the one

113
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.909
Anthony Taylor: it looks good to me. Go there.

114
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:14.990
Anthony Taylor: go there!

115
00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:20.939
Anthony Taylor: I don't have all of them in this one. How many do you have? Yes.

116
00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.110
Mason, Natalie: it's here.

117
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:24.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

118
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:31.019
Anthony Taylor: And now I should only have the one which is stop right there. Stop right there! Stop right click! That.

119
00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.310
Mason, Natalie: you know. Right click.

120
00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:37.860
Anthony Taylor: young lady.

121
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.470
I am right clicking.

122
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:42.500
Anthony Taylor: That's left clicking.

123
00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:49.229
Mason, Natalie: I'm also I also have a touch PIN. It's a little weird PIN to quick access

124
00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.759
Mason, Natalie: and to quick access.

125
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:55.370
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, now it's over in your folders on the left. Okay, keep going

126
00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:59.010
Mason, Natalie: double. Click, like like, go like your.

127
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.580
Anthony Taylor: you'll see. Just do normal. Now.

128
00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:04.860
Mason, Natalie: choose this

129
00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:07.820
Anthony Taylor: double click. Yeah, just double click, lesson. Plan

130
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.959
Anthony Taylor: your touch pan, okay? And then go to data prediction.

131
00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:15.969
I know I need a mouse.

132
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:17.420
Anthony Taylor: 3.

133
00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.070
Anthony Taylor: You're almost there activities

134
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.780
Mason, Natalie: right

135
00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:24.360
Anthony Taylor: solved.

136
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:28.530
Anthony Taylor: And that one and open.

137
00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:31.849
Mason, Natalie: So am I. Gonna have to do this for every single one.

138
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.759
Mason, Natalie: I hope not gotta help us.

139
00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:38.519
Anthony Taylor: So just skip that line. Just don't even run that line. Go to the next line

140
00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:41.240
Anthony Taylor: right now.

141
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.470
Anthony Taylor: run the next one.

142
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.590
Anthony Taylor: Everybody's gonna be experts. Run the next one.

143
00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:00.269
Mason, Natalie: Okay, choose files.

144
00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:02.360
Anthony Taylor: and let's see where you are.

145
00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:07.680
Anthony Taylor: Oh, there you go! So now just click oh, 0 one on top

146
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:11.280
Anthony Taylor: or up arrow, either. Web. Understand what I'm saying.

147
00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:13.860
Mason, Natalie: Wait what

148
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:15.960
Anthony Taylor: you can either click this

149
00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:20.129
Anthony Taylor: or you can click 0 one. It's up to you. There you go, resources

150
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:22.739
Anthony Taylor: and click that.

151
00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:25.530
Anthony Taylor: And there you go.

152
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.270
Anthony Taylor: You're in alright. We're all in same place now, right? Everybody.

153
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:32.319
Anthony Taylor: No more surprises.

154
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.869
Kanouff, Christine: I'm I'm getting a weird sorry.

155
00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:42.979
Kanouff, Christine: I'm getting a file weird. It's took me through this file not found error.

156
00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:47.289
Kanouff, Christine: And then I got a weird thing with my AI blah blah. Blah.

157
00:12:56.770 --> 00:13:00.109
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But you, how did you manage to not upload the file.

158
00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:05.500
Kanouff, Christine: I it just went right to this. I don't know.

159
00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:10.370
Anthony Taylor: That's okay. Click here, see, my arrow is click the play button.

160
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:13.840
Anthony Taylor: Choose your file.

161
00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.070
Anthony Taylor: Good.

162
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.870
Anthony Taylor: Press open

163
00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:24.010
Anthony Taylor: or upload gap. Oh, okay. So why did this feel

164
00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:26.360
Anthony Taylor: what?

165
00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.509
Anthony Taylor: Alright? Now I'm confused. Go up here to rent time

166
00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.150
Anthony Taylor: and

167
00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.180
Anthony Taylor: restart session.

168
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:50.209
Anthony Taylor: Yes. okay, scroll up a bit. Don't do the first one. Just run this

169
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:52.820
Anthony Taylor: and

170
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:54.060
this

171
00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.690
Anthony Taylor: and this

172
00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:02.659
Anthony Taylor: to wait. Gotsie's file.

173
00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:07.560
Anthony Taylor: Good! Click! That press up, though.

174
00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:26.440
Masarirambi, Rodney: That's why I'm I'm running into the same thing. It was taking too long to upload the the file as well initially, and then then I start hitting the same error.

175
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:36.090
I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on this. I wanna cause I don't know what it might do, because the whole reason we run. This is because.

176
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.969
Anthony Taylor: do you explain error at the bottom?

177
00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:44.750
Anthony Taylor: The only reason we run this thing is to is because everyone should be able to run it.

178
00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:47.410
Mason, Natalie: Mine's running.

179
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.939
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright copy. Click. This.

180
00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:58.149
Anthony Taylor: This is weird.

181
00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.260
Anthony Taylor: We're at Christine.

182
00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.420
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, click that

183
00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.680
Anthony Taylor: alright. Come back over here.

184
00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:10.700
go up to the top.

185
00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:13.980
Anthony Taylor: and then.

186
00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:19.900
Anthony Taylor: just like, hold your mouse over this right in this area to get a plus sign there. It is code

187
00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.070
Anthony Taylor: to paste in there.

188
00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:26.499
Anthony Taylor: I want to see if this actually works hit that button

189
00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:33.630
Anthony Taylor: scroll down. Yeah, see? I don't think that's right.

190
00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.439
Anthony Taylor: But anyway, go ahead, scroll down.

191
00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.660
Anthony Taylor: And now run both of these

192
00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:47.029
Anthony Taylor: and this one.

193
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.700
Anthony Taylor: And now this one. Try it again.

194
00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.919
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I did it. Did you write it?

195
00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.779
michael mcpherson: Or the notebook? What was the file where you needed to upload

196
00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:06.539
Anthony Taylor: the one in your only one in your resources. Strict.

197
00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.469
Anthony Taylor: I don't know what it's called hourly grid, hourly grid prices.

198
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:18.070
Kanouff, Christine: Yeah, I didn't do anything, and it's just backup there. So

199
00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:22.670
Kanouff, Christine: oh, it still says it's connecting.

200
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:28.540
Anthony Taylor: are you? Oh, wait a minute. What browser are you using?

201
00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:33.409
Kanouff, Christine: Probably safari.

202
00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:37.430
Anthony Taylor: Oh, goodness. Okay, let me tell you, guys.

203
00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:41.790
Anthony Taylor: okay, never, ever use safari for anything you actually care about.

204
00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:49.680
Kanouff, Christine: Yeah. okay. yeah. I know I have that. I know. I have that written down someplace.

205
00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.199
Anthony Taylor: Were you in safari also?

206
00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:06.319
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I'm gonna I clearly have not fast apple enough.

207
00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:10.739
Kanouff, Christine: Alright. It works for everything else.

208
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:21.050
Baro, Sonja: No, you have, Anthony, I can tell you. You've met. You've bashed it enough.

209
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:26.099
Anthony Taylor: Honest. So you guys do that. Tell me that still doesn't work. I'm gonna move forward

210
00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:29.209
Kanouff, Christine: and and we'll we'll come back and help you from you.

211
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.120
Kanouff, Christine: No worries. Alright.

212
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.840
Anthony Taylor: Well, I Marie.

213
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.360
Anthony Taylor: I have water ease. Okay.

214
00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:46.350
Anthony Taylor: alright. So we can now load the data because we have our file. And they gave us that code. Very nice. It's really no different than any other

215
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:51.310
Anthony Taylor: pandas. Read. Okay, they added, drop in a to the end of it, which is

216
00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.140
Anthony Taylor: both good and bad. Okay.

217
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.390
Anthony Taylor: so now we have now notice, as we told it.

218
00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:11.039
Anthony Taylor: to give us an index column. It started at us with an index column. and we have our prices. But we wanted to plot this. We just can say plot because we've already created our index.

219
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.749
Anthony Taylor: So here's our plot of the hourly prices

220
00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:18.290
Anthony Taylor: for 5 years.

221
00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:22.880
Anthony Taylor: That's a lot of data points. Okay.

222
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:24.960
Anthony Taylor: now.

223
00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:32.349
Anthony Taylor: we're going to start prepping it for profit. If you recall the other day we had to first get rid of the index column.

224
00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:46.549
Anthony Taylor: and we know and you could tell right that we did because of the way it's formatted here. It's flat instead of Ben. Okay. we're just taking a peek. Yep, that's correct.

225
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.149
Anthony Taylor: Now we're going to rename to DF and y like we did the other day

226
00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:55.549
Anthony Taylor: pretty much. This is where we stopped the other day, right? Our.

227
00:18:55.700 --> 00:19:00.029
Anthony Taylor: I don't know why we're dropping in a again. But why not? Right? It's fun to drop in a

228
00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:04.460
Anthony Taylor: such a useful command. Okay?

229
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:06.720
Anthony Taylor: Here we go.

230
00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:09.310
Anthony Taylor: machine learning

231
00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:13.090
Anthony Taylor: moment one. On December 18,

232
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:16.329
Anthony Taylor: at 6 50 PM. Mountain time.

233
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:32.220
Anthony Taylor: First step. Declare your model the model we're going to use. Here's profit. We're going to assign the declared model to a variable. This case, M,

234
00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:40.370
Anthony Taylor: and that's what looks like. This is a python object, I can tell. It is, in fact. profit model.

235
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:49.920
Anthony Taylor: That's all you need to know about that model. Next we will fit. Fit is another word for

236
00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.640
Baro, Sonja: train

237
00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.150
Baro, Sonja: training.

238
00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:09.350
Anthony Taylor: How you get your arms like that alright. All that training. Wow, that actually hurt. Okay. So we're going to take our data frame that we created and cleaned up

239
00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:12.730
Anthony Taylor: and put it into our fit method

240
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:14.150
Anthony Taylor: call that

241
00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:20.649
Anthony Taylor: okay? Now, this could take up to 30 s, depending on how much data you have. This could take weeks.

242
00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.780
Anthony Taylor: This particular data will only take about 30 s.

243
00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:32.869
Anthony Taylor: Sounds good. Question. Yeah, of course. Well, yeah, go for it and then sign your up.

244
00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:37.799
Meredith McCanse (she/her): What's it training on like this data right here.

245
00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:45.109
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So we called profit, which is the the model, the model.

246
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:59.320
Meredith McCanse (she/her): We didn't build our own model. We called an existing model. And then, okay, okay, yeah. So we called profit. And then it's basically absorbing all of our data. And

247
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:08.789
Meredith McCanse (she/her): it's looking at the past data looking for trends. So it's looking at all of this. And it's trying to find trends based on date.

248
00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:10.220
Meredith McCanse (she/her): okay, on time.

249
00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:18.829
Meredith McCanse (she/her): But it's not going out into the Internet, and like also researching similar words or keywords, or anything like that. It's all contained in whatever we've provided it. Okay.

250
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:24.510
Anthony Taylor: we're we aren't near there yet. That's AI stuff. That's 6, 7, 8 weeks out. Still.

251
00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:28.190
Anthony Taylor: this is just our first official machine learning model.

252
00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:34.919
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So that's good question. I like the questions, wait. Sonia had a question. And then, Mike.

253
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:48.819
Anthony Taylor: yeah, it was the same. So train is like, analyze right? Look for trends. Basically that that is what training is doing. We're taking an existing model. And we're saying, here's the data.

254
00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:54.510
Anthony Taylor: Look at this data, apply what you've been. You know what you do. However, it calculates

255
00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.909
Anthony Taylor: and come up with with an algorithm that you can use to make predictions.

256
00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:00.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay, yes, Mike.

257
00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:12.490
michael mcpherson: for the read, read and Csv file to a data frame. Normally, that's dot dot slash resources. Yadda, yadda, yadda.

258
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:14.069
michael mcpherson: kind of here.

259
00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:15.370
michael mcpherson: Yeah.

260
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:20.400
Anthony Taylor: cause you uploaded it, and if you look in the folder it's right here in the root.

261
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:24.230
Anthony Taylor: but you don't need to look in the folder. I gave you this code.

262
00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:27.180
Anthony Taylor: Right?

263
00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:28.870
michael mcpherson: Eddie. Read. Csv.

264
00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:30.670
Anthony Taylor: Yes, sir.

265
00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:36.059
michael mcpherson: index. Yeah. So because it's in the route. You don't need to do a path. But I mean, normally, you would. Yeah.

266
00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:37.959
Anthony Taylor: but not this time.

267
00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.430
Anthony Taylor: because it's in the root

268
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.389
Anthony Taylor: that make sense.

269
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:49.200
Anthony Taylor: Are you good, Mike?

270
00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.770
michael mcpherson: Yeah,

271
00:22:53.260 --> 00:23:00.980
Anthony Taylor: I'm being sensitive to the fact that you ask question. I don't want to go. Is it that easy? If somebody made a comment about that.

272
00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:03.320
Anthony Taylor: Okay, Meredith.

273
00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:10.270
Meredith McCanse (she/her): one more question. Can you only ever train data like this, though, when you just have basically 2 columns.

274
00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:11.989
Meredith McCanse (she/her): the D in the

275
00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:15.489
Meredith McCanse (she/her): looked into that? And the short answer is.

276
00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:19.330
Anthony Taylor: know that you can use profit with multiple columns. But we are not

277
00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:21.030
Meredith McCanse (she/her): got it. Okay.

278
00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:38.449
Anthony Taylor: after project are way bigger than

279
00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:41.420
Meredith McCanse (she/her): cool. This is just particularly good at time. Soup?

280
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:46.029
Anthony Taylor: Awesome. Okay? Yeah. Which I know is a big interest for you.

281
00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:51.959
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So you're gonna like today. Alright. So we have finished

282
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:53.260
Anthony Taylor: our training.

283
00:23:54.210 --> 00:24:01.139
Anthony Taylor: Now, the next step. we're going to take our existing data frame. So notice our existing data frame

284
00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.040
Anthony Taylor: stops on October fifteenth, 2020.

285
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:08.480
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this is the tape. Okay.

286
00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:16.210
Anthony Taylor: I am gonna come in here and say, I want you using profit as member we called M is profit.

287
00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.139
Anthony Taylor: I want you to make a future data frame.

288
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:29.950
Anthony Taylor: And I want you to add 720 time periods at the at hour.

289
00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:34.029
Anthony Taylor: So effectively, we're gonna add 720

290
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:37.360
Anthony Taylor: our 30 days

291
00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.610
Anthony Taylor: to our date data frame.

292
00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:49.569
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And this is what it'll look like when we tell it to do that. So? Note. Here's the beginning. 2,015. But now note.

293
00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:57.000
Anthony Taylor: we're in November now at the end. Now the other thing I want you to note do you see a Y here?

294
00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:03.410
Anthony Taylor: How could we have a why, we haven't done a prediction yet. This is the future.

295
00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:09.249
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I realize it's not really our future. But it's the future for this data frame.

296
00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.190
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So now.

297
00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:22.920
Baro, Sonja: Anthony, sorry I wanted to catch you real quick. So say that again, is that because the Y was referencing

298
00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:36.099
Baro, Sonja: like, where did we put? Is there a marker in the row that says, that's the marker. Right? Ds, y. This is the original data frame ds, and yep.

299
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:39.649
Anthony Taylor: why is the actual data we're training up? Yeah.

300
00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:50.100
Baro, Sonja: So the null is the part. Okay? And then so the absence of that value really is the mark demarcation of where we are starting to go into the future.

301
00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.870
Baro, Sonja: Is that right? I'm just asking, How would you know

302
00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:09.069
Anthony Taylor: like, how do you know where you've planned? Well, there is no future in this data frame. We are creating the future. So you decide what to predict. You decide how much in the future you want to go.

303
00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:15.209
Anthony Taylor: And then you use this, make future data frame, tell it how many periods you want, and that what

304
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:20.749
Anthony Taylor: cadence, if you will. Weekly, daily, monthly, whatever

305
00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:25.080
Anthony Taylor: and then it'll create this empty data frame with

306
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:26.210
Anthony Taylor: dates.

307
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:34.999
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But no. Why's cause we haven't done anything yet, cause it's gonna fill in the Y. The old wise are gonna get filled in.

308
00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:37.069
Anthony Taylor: The new ones are going to be predicted.

309
00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:42.910
Baro, Sonja: Okay? And then there create the data frame.

310
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:49.850
Baro, Sonja: Is, is there any other clue other than us? Remembering that we said, add

311
00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:55.300
Baro, Sonja: 30 days to the end of the the the existing data.

312
00:26:55.700 --> 00:27:00.340
Anthony Taylor: No, ma'am, you just decide how much you want to add and make a future.

313
00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:09.820
Anthony Taylor: All you're basically doing is putting placeholders, or he feels he feels. So the model knows what they wanted to predict. That's all.

314
00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.340
Baro, Sonja: Okay, thank you. And it's kind of cool to even off.

315
00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:20.230
Anthony Taylor: I think they're 2 separate data frames. Still, at this point, too.

316
00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:21.860
Meredith McCanse (she/her): right? They're not.

317
00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:23.060
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

318
00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:26.130
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Was that was that a confusion?

319
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:34.919
Baro, Sonja: And I didn't know it.

320
00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:42.830
Anthony Taylor: All we've done is created a model which effectively a model is a mathematical function.

321
00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:47.369
Anthony Taylor: that when we fit profit to the data it

322
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:57.280
Anthony Taylor: filled in this created this mathematical function. okay? And then stored it. And now, when we say, predict.

323
00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:04.150
Anthony Taylor: it's going to take the data and replay that function with the data we send for it to predict.

324
00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:09.930
Anthony Taylor: And this is the way every machine learning model works from here on out

325
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:15.909
Anthony Taylor: alright. It's just this one's a little to me. This is a little less clear, because it's only got one call data

326
00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:23.019
Anthony Taylor: to use right? Not the dates, but the actual value. When we do like the bigger models, we'll have lots of

327
00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:27.980
Anthony Taylor: to use to predict. But anyway, so we have our future. We're gonna say, Okay.

328
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:39.649
Anthony Taylor: I want you to create a new data frame called forecast. We're going to use our profit, model the predict method and pass in this future data.

329
00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.540
Anthony Taylor: the one with the new dates

330
00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:45.749
Anthony Taylor: alright. And then we're going to look at the beginning. And yet.

331
00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:52.520
Anthony Taylor: And Rodney Brave is almost worse than safari.

332
00:28:53.560 --> 00:29:02.710
Anthony Taylor: and I have rave on my computer. I don't know. It's it's a whole lot better than chrome. So why do you think chrome is bad? I don't use pro either, but

333
00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:07.989
Masarirambi, Rodney: it's it's just a memory log. And it's

334
00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:13.170
Masarirambi, Rodney: sorry like edge. Yeah, edge edge is way. Better

335
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:17.310
Masarirambi, Rodney: edge edge is also a memory hub. But I've got a Max. I can't use edge. But

336
00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:27.789
Anthony Taylor: do you know why Edge is not a memory hot? Because it turns off. But Chrome does, too. Now. So that's no longer writing. Well, at least it does on a windows.

337
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:31.360
Anthony Taylor: anyway. Okay, so

338
00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:37.070
Anthony Taylor: here we are. This is the out. This is a lot.

339
00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:40.389
Anthony Taylor: Alright. The good news is.

340
00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:46.259
Anthony Taylor: we are only gonna care about like 3 of these calls.

341
00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:49.610
Anthony Taylor: Okay, notice, there's 22 of them.

342
00:29:51.490 --> 00:30:03.170
Anthony Taylor: You if you want to really get into  time series, like, maybe, Meredith. right then you will want to learn what all this other stuff is.

343
00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:05.650
Anthony Taylor: Okay, right now.

344
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:14.480
Anthony Taylor: Y hat. And I love this great story. Why do you think they call it Y hat. Any of my numbers people, Jennifer.

345
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:20.769
Anthony Taylor: Anybody want to guess why they call it y hat. Go ahead, Matt. So y wearing a little hat.

346
00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:27.169
Anthony Taylor: It's why a carrot. So it's what's basically saying

347
00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:29.820
Anthony Taylor: is something like that.

348
00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:33.799
Anthony Taylor: Okay, they call that little mark right there, this little mark.

349
00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:36.450
Anthony Taylor: a hat sometimes.

350
00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:44.860
Anthony Taylor: So this is someone being cute, and instead of making it white carrot. they made it y hat.

351
00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:50.430
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So why, hat is the actual prediction?

352
00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:59.730
Anthony Taylor: It says prophet is saying that on this day we believe this is the prediction.

353
00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:02.010
Anthony Taylor: But

354
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:06.670
Anthony Taylor: one thing about

355
00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:12.219
Anthony Taylor: profit. It knows it's not all it that's impossible

356
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:19.110
Anthony Taylor: to get that perfect. So they give us a Y hat lower and a Y hat upper.

357
00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:23.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Which basically means

358
00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:31.279
Anthony Taylor: it's probably that. But it could be anything between here and there. I want you to look at that range.

359
00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:46.380
Anthony Taylor: It sounds like a weatherman to me. Exactly. The actual prediction was 16.

360
00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:50.080
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

361
00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:52.940
Anthony Taylor: but this is how profit works. Yes, ma'am.

362
00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:57.800
Dipinto, Matt: So you're using the same data. We are right? Because I got different predictions than you.

363
00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:00.610
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I believe so.

364
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:05.050
Anthony Taylor: I mean, we're all running same thing. What did you get? They could be sorted differently.

365
00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:12.140
Dipinto, Matt: So I'm from negative 24 to 34 for 2,01510 31 at 0 one. Yeah.

366
00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:14.019
Anthony Taylor: yeah. Yeah.

367
00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:18.460
Anthony Taylor: we're not using or anything. So it's possible.

368
00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:28.770
Anthony Taylor: And I'm the same at, I have like a minus 2 on the lower to 36 on the top.

369
00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:32.500
Anthony Taylor: The the problem with one column machine learning.

370
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.720
Anthony Taylor: okay, is that it's totally crap

371
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:37.770
Anthony Taylor: to be honest. But

372
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:41.779
Anthony Taylor: I mean, people swear by profit that it's pretty close.

373
00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:46.609
Anthony Taylor: So I don't know, you know, profit was trained by Facebook.

374
00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:58.160
Anthony Taylor: And they they claim Facebook has an awful lot of data to work with. So it's possible. But that is an awfully huge range. I don't know that I'd get too excited about a range like that.

375
00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:02.690
Anthony Taylor: However, before we're over today we will see some cool examples

376
00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:04.799
Anthony Taylor: where that range really isn't very big.

377
00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:09.689
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And when the range isn't very big, then you're like, all right, this is kind of cool.

378
00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:13.080
Anthony Taylor: So with that.

379
00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:15.450
Anthony Taylor: we have an activity.

380
00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:22.969
Anthony Taylor: You're like, how is that possible? It's pretty much do exactly what we just did.

381
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:30.279
Anthony Taylor: except instead of hours and 720. You're gonna do W, and 52 periods.

382
00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:34.880
Anthony Taylor: It's pretty much the only thing to little bit different date. Okay.

383
00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:38.760
Anthony Taylor: us let me set you guys up.

384
00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:41.780
Anthony Taylor: I saw a chat bubble.

385
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:48.730
Anthony Taylor: I think it can be based on every time you write it to schedule. Well, yeah, I mean it. We're not using random seat

386
00:33:49.630 --> 00:34:00.169
Anthony Taylor: so. And and I know we've talked about random seed, but probably pretty high level right now. We'll talk about it more later. Random seed is the only way I can guarantee you get what I get.

387
00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:01.530
Baro, Sonja: Yeah.

388
00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:05.929
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So I say, set the random seed 42,

389
00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.340
Anthony Taylor: okay. And everybody does that.

390
00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:14.719
Anthony Taylor: Every random number generator in that notebook will run exactly the same as the next guy.

391
00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:22.069
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's still random, but it's random based on that C. So we all get the things out.

392
00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.019
michael mcpherson: But yeah, since you didn't do a random seat.

393
00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:28.020
Anthony Taylor: Hi, Mike.

394
00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:29.469
michael mcpherson: add it.

395
00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:32.129
Anthony Taylor: Welcome back, everybody.

396
00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:46.850
Anthony Taylor: So I apologize that that one was as complicated as it was. I should spend a little more time reviewing it. Make sure you could, all easily completed in the amount of time allotted.

397
00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:57.970
Anthony Taylor: I know you did not. because only a few of you came back to the main moon early. so I know none of you would just sit around and chit, chat

398
00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:01.840
Anthony Taylor: and not come and see me in the main room.

399
00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:11.170
Anthony Taylor: Well, we might have been talking about the content and playing around with some of it. That's right. Oh, well, that's good

400
00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:22.190
Baro, Sonja: cause, like we discuss. Oh, we can change the timeframe pretty easily from hour to minute to. So I just share that

401
00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.930
Baro, Sonja: we may have been actually talking about the assignment.

402
00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:30.529
Anthony Taylor: I don't even know what you're talking about right now. Are you telling me that you finished early.

403
00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:39.089
Baro, Sonja: No cause, you know, we we can use the time we were given productively. We ever really finished

404
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:44.430
Anthony Taylor: click, run off, I know, because, according to the the comments, you never get enough time.

405
00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:49.109
Anthony Taylor: which I told you guys about time. But you know.

406
00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:52.129
Anthony Taylor: that's just okay. Here we go.

407
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:56.920
Anthony Taylor: You guys got to tell me which part you coded.

408
00:35:57.590 --> 00:36:03.260
Anthony Taylor: So I know when we get there. Okay. So we're gonna bring in some files this part, you codon

409
00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:04.550
Anthony Taylor: good work.

410
00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:09.159
Anthony Taylor: and then we're gonna load it.

411
00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:12.199
Anthony Taylor: There's our 5. Notice. 2 columns is tight.

412
00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:15.370
Anthony Taylor: However, as we pointed out.

413
00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:21.090
Anthony Taylor:  for profit, we want one column right now. So we're gonna

414
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:34.159
Anthony Taylor: select out, just Canada. create our Ds, and y's. so we have our profit ready. Canada data. Then we're gonna do. Uruguay. Did did you guys have to code this part.

415
00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:40.790
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Good. Alright. And now we're gonna model.

416
00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:43.490
Anthony Taylor: marvel

417
00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:46.320
Anthony Taylor: fit.

418
00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:51.850
Anthony Taylor: This is a very small amount of data fit.

419
00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:55.409
Anthony Taylor: Now that we have our models

420
00:36:55.530 --> 00:37:03.320
Anthony Taylor: and we have trained them. Let's create our future data frame, which just gives us an extra 52 weeks

421
00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:06.379
Anthony Taylor: for both Canada and Uruguay.

422
00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:10.659
Anthony Taylor: and then we will forecast.

423
00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:14.570
Anthony Taylor: And again. Now.

424
00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:22.880
Anthony Taylor: I wasn't even supposed to tell you about y hat yet. Okay. so you don't know anything about it at this point. So which part of this did you guys? Code

425
00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:37.700
Anthony Taylor: we deleted all of it and then started encoded ourselves. He's a good student, that boy, I tell you. Thank you, sir.

426
00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:45.360
Anthony Taylor: There you go! Alright. So the whole point of that was really just to get to that prediction, not to

427
00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:47.630
Anthony Taylor: really look at it. Now

428
00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:49.750
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna look at it.

429
00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:55.399
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're gonna read those results. Cause we didn't read them before. I'm sure none of you looked at them.

430
00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:59.109
Anthony Taylor: We're going to plot the upper and lower bounds. Now.

431
00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:02.940
Anthony Taylor: this is that y hat. Y low. Y high.

432
00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:04.420
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

433
00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:07.339
Anthony Taylor: all right. Why, they're in Denver.

434
00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:15.719
Anthony Taylor: Why, low? Y high, right? So we're gonna actually plot it to show the highest, the lowest, and

435
00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:16.710
Anthony Taylor: the mill.

436
00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:20.990
Anthony Taylor: Only Natalie was on board that way. Yes, I'm

437
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:29.530
Baro, Sonja: so this is something that we did talk about, which was, if you could have the whiskers and show the band of that

438
00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:34.370
Baro, Sonja: that you can see the confidence

439
00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:44.209
Anthony Taylor: level perfect. You're gonna see that in moments perfect. Okay, so I'm gonna show you guys this. But basically what we're gonna do is we're gonna plot these 3 values.

440
00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.699
Anthony Taylor: and this will give you your hat.

441
00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:50.929
Anthony Taylor: the lowest that we think it'll be, and the highest we think it'll be.

442
00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:58.399
Anthony Taylor: and it'll be very, very exciting. In fact, I know you're all shivering with anticip

443
00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:00.270
Anthony Taylor: patient.

444
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:07.790
Anthony Taylor: I got one or 2 with that one, too. I'm feeling good today.

445
00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:10.970
Anthony Taylor: I've used that one before, though

446
00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.710
Clayton Graves: I knew the reference. I was just muted.

447
00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:18.820
Anthony Taylor: I know you were. You should have been like saying it with me.

448
00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:20.720
Anthony Taylor: Hi!

449
00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:30.990
Anthony Taylor: I was gonna start seeing the time work. But I figure that's inappropriate. Okay, here we go. We're going to import everything.

450
00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:36.290
Anthony Taylor: We're going to import our file uploader and get our file

451
00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:40.050
Anthony Taylor: in this case, what is it? Actually.

452
00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:42.069
hourly grid?

453
00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:46.540
Anthony Taylor: So here I'm in the right place.

454
00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:55.020
Anthony Taylor: And then we're gonna put it in the data frame. So none of this is new. None of this is really all that exciting. Okay.

455
00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.440
Anthony Taylor: this is a pretty big file. Actually.

456
00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.200
Anthony Taylor: there we go.

457
00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:16.309
Anthony Taylor: Note, it is indexed on day hour again. Why do we do that? Because we want to plot it easily. So if we index it this way, all we got to do is hit plot, and we can see the whole thing.

458
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:27.210
Anthony Taylor: And so here is our we're going to reset our index. Take a quick peek. do our Ds and Y drop our in haze.

459
00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.830
Anthony Taylor: initialize our model.

460
00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:37.959
Anthony Taylor: fit our model. I know I'm moving fast, but I don't think anybody has any questions about this yet. If you do say.

461
00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:39.440
Anthony Taylor: stop

462
00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:42.270
Anthony Taylor: this one's a take a second.

463
00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.810
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Anthony, do you? Oh, go ahead!

464
00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:59.240
Anthony Taylor: No, go! No, no, no! Now it's a good time.

465
00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:01.290
Meredith McCanse (she/her): If you have stuff.

466
00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:04.460
Meredith McCanse (she/her): do you have stuff on your team that you build that like

467
00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:14.839
Meredith McCanse (she/her): tends to go through the same steps like this does, and in those cases. Do you have like templates, template setup, where you just kind of copy and paste it in there? Or do you automate that in some way.

468
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:18.600
Anthony Taylor: So yes.

469
00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:22.999
Anthony Taylor: would you like me to do that?

470
00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:31.670
Anthony Taylor: So we have tools. We have a particularly what tool called email flow, that we use quite a bit.

471
00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:34.360
Anthony Taylor: And what we do is we build

472
00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:43.669
Anthony Taylor: so because everything basically fits the same model fit predict template with variations. Okay, we can build functions

473
00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:51.079
Anthony Taylor: that we pass it in certain things. And then if we put them into a pipeline, all of this, you're going to learn later.

474
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:56.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we have another open source tool call. Yeah. Ml, flow, and it's used by

475
00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:58.769
pretty much everybody in the world.

476
00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:06.030
Anthony Taylor: That does it, man. And what it does is it actually tracks these exercise. Call them experiments.

477
00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:09.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And

478
00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:22.349
Anthony Taylor: yes, all of it is much simplified. Typically, there's someone like me, or something that goes through and kind of creates functions. But I mean create functions that let you have to model.

479
00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:31.889
Anthony Taylor: So you don't even have to have like you can go into and go. Oh, there's this new model out. I want to try training with that.

480
00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:37.690
Anthony Taylor: and you can pass it into my function and the data you want. And it just does all this stuff, for

481
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:41.659
Anthony Taylor: you will learn that I will make sure you know how to do that.

482
00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:46.519
Anthony Taylor: Okay, doesn't make it the, the, the

483
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:52.630
Anthony Taylor: the science of data science. And this is a statement you can remember. I don't think we ever say it. In course.

484
00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:57.609
Anthony Taylor: the science of data science is how to tune

485
00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:58.880
Anthony Taylor: your model.

486
00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:04.190
Anthony Taylor: picking a model and running it simple. Anybody in this room could do it

487
00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:13.059
Anthony Taylor: by. In 3 weeks you'll be able to do any. Okay picking a model, running it and tuning it.

488
00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:14.830
Anthony Taylor: That takes time.

489
00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:24.779
Anthony Taylor: That's not. That's something I can give you pointers on, but not teach. Make sense. Okay, it's kind of the Archie part of data science.

490
00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:29.719
Anthony Taylor: aye. can teach you to draw, but it can't make you an artist.

491
00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:43.960
Anthony Taylor: Okay. did that encourage you? Discourage you? Okay, good. Alright. So we've trained. Now, we're going to extend by 30 days again.

492
00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:47.900
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're basically just getting to where we left off last. Okay.

493
00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:53.340
Anthony Taylor: so we're going to run our predict with the future data.

494
00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:57.790
Anthony Taylor: And then we're gonna move on locked.

495
00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:04.109
Anthony Taylor: Do? So remember, this one's like crazy

496
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:08.719
Anthony Taylor: range. So when we see the plot for this one, it's gonna be a.

497
00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.950
Anthony Taylor: But let's look and see there, it is.

498
00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:24.989
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So basically, the black dots are actual data points. The blue line that looks remarkably thick in this picture is the actual

499
00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.809
Anthony Taylor: data is the line is the prediction line.

500
00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.709
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So it's like going down the middle.

501
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:33.829
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you notice at the end here.

502
00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:35.669
Anthony Taylor: there's no dots.

503
00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:38.780
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Because we haven't got there yet.

504
00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:41.750
Anthony Taylor:  so this is.

505
00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:46.099
Anthony Taylor: Oh, this is for why they're showing both of them.

506
00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:49.330
Anthony Taylor: Oh, it's just showing them side by side, or it's the same one.

507
00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:50.969
Anthony Taylor: Oh, and I'm looking.

508
00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:53.889
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, it's the same one.

509
00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:58.350
Anthony Taylor: Yep, that same one twice, for some reason, I think. Oh, maybe they had it enough.

510
00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:00.880
Anthony Taylor: So yeah, so this is the live chart.

511
00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:03.019
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now.

512
00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:06.279
Anthony Taylor: we're not gonna worry about all of this stuff right now.

513
00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:19.959
Anthony Taylor: what we really want to worry about is just y hat like lower y hat up. So we're gonna grab those take a quick peek at them. That's what they look like.  we're going to set the index to. Ds.

514
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:26.810
Anthony Taylor: okay. take a look at that. and then we're just going to plot

515
00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:37.750
Anthony Taylor: y hat, y hat lower and y hat upper and notice, we're only doing the predicted data. So everybody see that and understand? That's what that is.

516
00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:42.430
Anthony Taylor: Because, remember, we asked for 720 new rows of data.

517
00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:46.610
Anthony Taylor: So this is giving us the last 720 rows.

518
00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:50.170
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and we're going to plot it.

519
00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:57.419
Anthony Taylor: Now. how would you explain this to? You? Have a customer?

520
00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:05.110
Anthony Taylor: How would you explain that to them? Anybody give me. Give me your best sales pitch!

521
00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:18.349
Clayton Graves: How would you explain what you're seeing on screen? The blue is the so the green and the orange are the range where it can be, and the blue is where we believe it's going to be.

522
00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:22.050
Anthony Taylor: That's fantastic. That's simple.

523
00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:32.080
Anthony Taylor: easy to understand. The green is the highest we expect. It's going to be. The orange is the lowest. It might be. The blue is where we think it's gonna

524
00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:34.929
Anthony Taylor: based on our model.

525
00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:37.650
Anthony Taylor: That's it.

526
00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:42.009
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So if you're advising somebody, this one has a massive rate.

527
00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:49.980
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but not all of them. Alright. So what else we got? We can. Also. we're gonna reset the index back to flat.

528
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:56.260
Anthony Taylor: Oh, here's another cool model. So here we can say, M, remember, that's the profit model

529
00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:04.360
Anthony Taylor: and plot components and then pass in our forecast data frame

530
00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:06.840
Anthony Taylor: and look at what we get.

531
00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:10.760
Anthony Taylor: We get

532
00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:15.690
Anthony Taylor: trend data frame. This is by year

533
00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:26.470
Anthony Taylor: or well, it says Trend. So it's by trend. But I hear. okay, weekly. This is what our data looks like on a weekly trend

534
00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:31.610
Anthony Taylor: by day of the week. by or by year.

535
00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.069
Anthony Taylor: and then even by day.

536
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:45.250
Anthony Taylor: So we can see that by day this data trend tends to go high around 5 in the afternoon

537
00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.450
Anthony Taylor: or evening, I guess, and then

538
00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:55.059
Anthony Taylor: seems to be way higher in July. Timeframe

539
00:47:56.490 --> 00:48:07.819
Anthony Taylor: weekly Tuesdays. Crazy high, actually off the middle of the week. It's pretty high and drops on the weekends. I think this is electricity, by the way. and then the trend is

540
00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:11.169
Anthony Taylor: over the years. The worst was in this range.

541
00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:15.060
Anthony Taylor: Huh!

542
00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:17.499
Anthony Taylor: Pretty cool. Huh!

543
00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:21.900
Anthony Taylor: All of that from just 2 columns of data.

544
00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:26.250
Anthony Taylor: Pretty wild. Alright!

545
00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:29.289
Anthony Taylor: Aye, questions about that.

546
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:39.720
Anthony Taylor: So I got some good news for you and your next exercise. The chart looks a little more, a little simpler to

547
00:48:41.550 --> 00:48:45.030
Anthony Taylor: yeah. So

548
00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:47.290
Anthony Taylor: you

549
00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:56.439
Anthony Taylor: we're not done for the day. No, our goal is help. Potential power. Oh, okay, this was the electricity one

550
00:48:56.490 --> 00:49:04.749
Anthony Taylor: for purchasing solar panels. We use profit to analyze the electricity prices and break down price data as an hourly Time series.

551
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:10.800
Anthony Taylor: We separated data into identifiable patterns that occur across days of week

552
00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:22.459
Anthony Taylor: hours, the day months of the year. That's those last 4 charts by breaking down complicated series into these types of patterns. We can better predict future data.

553
00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:25.610
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And all right, we already said this one.

554
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:27.390
Anthony Taylor: Clayton did a great job.

555
00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:32.720
Anthony Taylor: Okay, the green line represents the highest, most likely outcome.

556
00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:39.540
Anthony Taylor:  so we applied that to predicting electrical products. Further predicament practice.

557
00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:45.819
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you can use the same code to solve other issues.

558
00:49:46.310 --> 00:49:48.190
Anthony Taylor: So is, it's time series.

559
00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:50.360
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

560
00:49:54.220 --> 00:50:04.290
Anthony Taylor: this activity. You're gonna do safe. I think this is also Al Pacus. It's interesting. It says 20 min on here, but it says 15 min. I'm here.

561
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:09.289
Anthony Taylor: I think, as fast as you guys were done last

562
00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:12.610
Anthony Taylor: thinking, 15 should be enough.

563
00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:18.910
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna have a little bit of fun for a few seconds. Okay.

564
00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:26.149
Mason, Natalie: so nobody anything but that snippy com. No, nobody writes snippy comments.

565
00:50:27.310 --> 00:50:28.800
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna have some fun.

566
00:50:29.890 --> 00:50:31.699
michael mcpherson: Sniffy comments are fun

567
00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:33.200
Anthony Taylor: now.

568
00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:37.980
Anthony Taylor: So what was happening was I was showing Kevin

569
00:50:38.050 --> 00:50:54.039
Anthony Taylor: like, some of the a lot of like like some of you will ask me for references. Okay, like for programs or whatever. So I send out references. And I had them all we were talking about. And then I was playing around with like Chat Gp and my references.

570
00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:57.480
Anthony Taylor: And then I came across this.

571
00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:00.240
Anthony Taylor: Listen closely.

572
00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:03.770
Anthony Taylor: and and this is our Christmas

573
00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:07.000
Anthony Taylor: story.

574
00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:15.010
Anthony Taylor: Twas the night before analysis in the land of data so vast. we're prophet. A tool

575
00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:16.789
Anthony Taylor: was up to the task.

576
00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:24.760
Anthony Taylor: It's algorithms hum through time series with care. predicting the future, with patterns laid bare.

577
00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:32.130
Anthony Taylor: with seasonal trends and holidays to profit, would find what was false and what true.

578
00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:39.680
Anthony Taylor: from retail to finance, it made forecast clear, giving insights and guidance to all who would hear

579
00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:41.930
Anthony Taylor: so data. Analysts

580
00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:47.939
Anthony Taylor: with their charts all aglow, watched as prophets made their time series, show

581
00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:51.649
Anthony Taylor: the future once murky, now brighter than day.

582
00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:55.500
Anthony Taylor: thanks to profit the time Series way.

583
00:51:57.450 --> 00:52:01.989
Mason, Natalie: There you go. Yay.

584
00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:10.300
Clayton Graves: nothing. I have nothing but snarky commons, so

585
00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:18.530
Anthony Taylor: I'm sorry I had to do it. It's all right. I could have done the Shakespearean version, which I mean, you know I love accents

586
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:21.429
Anthony Taylor: alright. Let's let's review

587
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:31.810
Clayton Graves: real quick. Before we jump into this we ran into an issue, and and I spent way too much time troubleshooting it before I was way on

588
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:34.809
Clayton Graves: we got duplicate

589
00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:48.919
Clayton Graves: index columns. So when we set the call, when we set the index to to Ds, it didn't actually drop the index column, it just made the Ds call on the index.

590
00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:53.060
Anthony Taylor: That's interesting, I think.

591
00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:57.929
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, let's see what happens. So show me where that happens when we get there, and then, Boom.

592
00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:11.390
Anthony Taylor: see if we can figure it out. because I'm interested in what what that was. Alright. So I also didn't see what they didn't give you. So we're gonna go through the whole

593
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:15.020
Anthony Taylor: alright.

594
00:53:16.830 --> 00:53:19.469
Anthony Taylor: Okay, let's upload the file.

595
00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:20.620
Anthony Taylor: Sorry? What?

596
00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:25.589
michael mcpherson: What's that zoom type?

597
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:31.110
Anthony Taylor: Oh, thank you, sir. alright. So we've uploaded the file. We're gonna load data frame.

598
00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:36.570
Anthony Taylor: It's the same data frame as we had earlier. We're gonna plot it. We did that earlier.

599
00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:43.990
Anthony Taylor: In fact, we did all of this earlier right up until the chart, right? So we modeled it.

600
00:53:44.050 --> 00:53:48.039
Anthony Taylor: Model did. Tell me if I'm wrong I'll slow down. Don't think I'm wrong.

601
00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:52.840
Anthony Taylor:  And then we added the periods

602
00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:54.409
Anthony Taylor: for both of them.

603
00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:58.110
Anthony Taylor: And then we did our predictions.

604
00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:09.510
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so I believe this is pretty much where we stop the last exercise that we did this. So here, we're going to plot just Canada.

605
00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:12.440
Anthony Taylor: Very pretty. Huh?

606
00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:17.229
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now notice, see, this one's not crazy like the other.

607
00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:21.739
Anthony Taylor: The other one. The uppers and lowers were super far away from the line.

608
00:54:21.850 --> 00:54:24.669
Anthony Taylor: this one, they're very close.

609
00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:35.039
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So as as you guys went this one hopefully, you saw that this one's not nearly as crazy as that electricity one we were looking at.

610
00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:39.629
Anthony Taylor: Same for your advice. The other thing you should notice here is. Look how similar these charts are.

611
00:54:42.130 --> 00:54:44.389
Anthony Taylor: They're super similar. Wouldn't you agree?

612
00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:52.700
Anthony Taylor: And yet we know that they're actually somewhat inverse of each other so. But from a time series.

613
00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:57.089
Anthony Taylor: prediction standpoint. We're looking at this going. This is pretty similar.

614
00:54:57.210 --> 00:54:58.410
Anthony Taylor: It's just there's like.

615
00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:06.380
Anthony Taylor: I don't think he hurt me, or she did. Wait. What did you? Okay.

616
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:08.869
Anthony Taylor: I said, enough of that, Mrs. Mcpherson.

617
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:14.279
Anthony Taylor: She she gave gave him a kiss. It was, it was kind of funny. Okay.

618
00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:16.080
Anthony Taylor: so

619
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:21.410
Anthony Taylor: So here is our data from the predictions. Okay?

620
00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:23.550
Anthony Taylor: And

621
00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:36.600
Clayton Graves: we're we're setting the index to this. So this is where it happened. Button. Yeah, this is what happened. So we set the index to DS. Okay. But in our case it did not drop that. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 column.

622
00:55:37.330 --> 00:55:41.619
Clayton Graves: it said, like we told it to, but it did not drop.

623
00:55:41.970 --> 00:55:48.160
Clayton Graves: There is an argument you can add to set index to make sure it drops it, but it's by default it should have dropped.

624
00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:52.600
Anthony Taylor: That's interesting. I don't know why I would do that.

625
00:55:52.930 --> 00:55:55.549
Anthony Taylor: I mean here you clearly see, it did. But I mean what

626
00:55:56.130 --> 00:56:04.270
Raugewitz, Tania: in my case, Clayton. I didn't set a variable to it. which is why I didn't get I didn't. I didn't do that.

627
00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:12.370
Anthony Taylor: Oh, I didn't either. There you go! There you go. So when you reopen, did it still look like the old I got. Okay.

628
00:56:12.790 --> 00:56:18.599
Anthony Taylor: Thank you. Good job, Tommy. So here we're just going to pull out

629
00:56:18.850 --> 00:56:22.880
Anthony Taylor: the Y hats with just the last 52 rows.

630
00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:28.919
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And and see. See! Look at this chart. So if you showed somebody this chart

631
00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:42.049
Anthony Taylor: and said, This is the high, lowest. This is where it's at. This doesn't look bad at all right compared to the last one which, like they were like a mile apart. Okay, so this looks pretty good. And this is what profit does for.

632
00:56:42.610 --> 00:56:49.090
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then here's the Uruguay what? And again. you're gonna see that the charts

633
00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:57.389
Anthony Taylor: are fairly. I mean, it's not exactly the same months. Okay, obviously. But it's basically the same pattern.

634
00:56:57.810 --> 00:57:09.759
Anthony Taylor:  So with that we could reasonably well  Say, you know, they could pretty much duplicate these time periods in Japan, and they should be fine

635
00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:15.570
Anthony Taylor: now we're gonna reset the index and then do the clock components.

636
00:57:15.810 --> 00:57:23.899
Anthony Taylor: So here we have the trend over years that well, the the trend over years, and then the yearly

637
00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:27.919
Anthony Taylor: that rates. Okay? And that's for

638
00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:33.210
Anthony Taylor: that's for Canada. And then that's

639
00:57:34.170 --> 00:57:36.380
Anthony Taylor: for your advice. So we can say

640
00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:42.529
Anthony Taylor: this timeframe for Canada this timeframe for your advice.

641
00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:48.030
Meredith McCanse (she/her): And is it basically, this is volume of scarf sales. Right?

642
00:57:48.770 --> 00:57:49.770
Anthony Taylor: Yes.

643
00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:59.300
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So basically don't go into business. And 20 don't go into business selling scarves like both of them are. It's all pretty much downhill, right?

644
00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:08.049
Anthony Taylor: Well, the overall trend is. But I think that what what the original question was is, we want to sell scarves in Japan.

645
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:14.219
Anthony Taylor: So what? Based on the trends in Canada and Uruguay, for whatever reason

646
00:58:14.590 --> 00:58:16.589
Anthony Taylor: those were selected, we don't know that.

647
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:24.649
Anthony Taylor: But you know when would be the best time to try to sell them in Japan? And the answer the only answer, Oh, go ahead

648
00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:26.850
michael mcpherson: north and south hemisphere.

649
00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:31.320
Anthony Taylor: Maybe. That's pretty well. What atmosphere is Japan in it.

650
00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:33.940
michael mcpherson: isn't it? In the middle, in the north?

651
00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:47.130
Clayton Graves: Okay, I could go with that. But but based on Overall Trend here. The answer is, don't don't have been dropping for a while

652
00:58:47.210 --> 00:59:00.239
Masarirambi, Rodney: right, but but but it starts off. It starts up pretty high. So what you want to do is get a limited quantity. Do a big run, and then you should be done with it. People on buying like you are keeping them off for a while.

653
00:59:00.610 --> 00:59:01.550
Masarirambi, Rodney: So

654
00:59:02.590 --> 00:59:06.909
Clayton Graves: this is why you are going places and I go to war.

655
00:59:06.930 --> 00:59:18.819
michael mcpherson: Market doesn't expand. You're you're going like this right? The number of total people to go sell. Why don't you just make crappier scarf so that they have to replace?

656
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:25.640
Mason, Natalie: Then in that case

657
00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:29.130
Mason, Natalie: there's an alpaca store down the road. Here

658
00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:35.309
Mason, Natalie: they sell out package, though not scarce. Clothing

659
00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:38.239
apple does it differently. Clayton

660
00:59:38.330 --> 00:59:45.249
Anthony Taylor: Apple makes very good equipment, and then they say they're not going to support it anymore after a couple of years. So you don't have a choice.

661
00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:48.600
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But they're longer than Google, though

662
00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:51.899
Baro, Sonja: about that.

663
00:59:52.310 --> 00:59:57.939
Anthony Taylor: I got Google. I've had Google my whole life. II

664
00:59:58.070 --> 01:00:11.850
Baro, Sonja: I returned it the next week. Anthony, can you scroll back up for a minute to this before the plot. No, before the plot. Something didn't happen with my data frame. Sorry

665
01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:13.000
Anthony Taylor: here.

666
01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:17.210
Anthony Taylor: Tell me which command.

667
01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:23.409
Baro, Sonja: oh, Canada, don't predict future Canada. See? I did all that.

668
01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:28.980
Baro, Sonja: You're good. Thank you.

669
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:30.320
Anthony Taylor: Thank you.

670
01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:35.230
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Any questions about that?

671
01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:37.230
Anthony Taylor: No.

672
01:00:37.650 --> 01:00:43.529
Anthony Taylor: alright. Well, it is break time. Actually, it really is. Break time, too. So everybody come back at 8 30.

673
01:00:43.830 --> 01:00:44.860
Anthony Taylor: I'll see you that

674
01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:50.609
Anthony Taylor: come on First

675
01:00:55.270 --> 01:01:00.050
Anthony Taylor: Cause. Now we actually have something long time to do.

676
01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:04.560
Anthony Taylor: See if there's anything to talk about here. Yeah, there's not.

677
01:01:04.650 --> 01:01:08.029
Anthony Taylor: They're actually calling this a mini project which usually

678
01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:10.309
Anthony Taylor: I don't like those. But

679
01:01:11.590 --> 01:01:15.100
Anthony Taylor: in this case I kind of like it. It's not bad at all.

680
01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:18.989
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to open it up and show you what you're going to do.

681
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:24.809
Anthony Taylor: Is everybody back yet? Matt Hampton?

682
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:28.260
Anthony Taylor: Come on back.

683
01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:33.480
Anthony Taylor: Thank you. Only reason I want you all here is because this is this is a

684
01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:38.099
Anthony Taylor: if I recall this one's got some busyness to it.

685
01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.349
Anthony Taylor: You're going to want to hear the structure.

686
01:01:43.110 --> 01:01:45.109
Anthony Taylor: All right. So

687
01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:55.410
Anthony Taylor: this is the unsoul. Okay. it's basically doing what we've been doing. It's with a new data set. Bitcoin hourly.

688
01:01:55.660 --> 01:02:00.320
Anthony Taylor: Oh, yeah, thanks. Just just product. So I don't feel too bad this time.

689
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:02.200
michael mcpherson: Did you click report?

690
01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:04.830
Anthony Taylor: I did do that like a while ago.

691
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:10.270
Anthony Taylor: That's that little red dot on the screen of it. Okay?

692
01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:12.800
Anthony Taylor: So

693
01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:19.130
Anthony Taylor: basically gonna bring in data. It's Bitcoin hourly. You're going to chart. You're going to plot it.

694
01:02:19.730 --> 01:02:23.840
Anthony Taylor: You're going to set it up to work with profit.

695
01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:33.750
Anthony Taylor: You're going to sort it. plot it again. then set up your profit, run your profit.

696
01:02:34.170 --> 01:02:37.360
Anthony Taylor: create a future 40 days in advance.

697
01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:40.209
Anthony Taylor: Just notice, that's a thousand hours.

698
01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:43.319
Anthony Taylor: Okay, make your predictions.

699
01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:44.570
Anthony Taylor: Got it?

700
01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:50.479
Anthony Taylor: Alright. And then use the plot components. Feature.

701
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:51.980
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

702
01:02:52.170 --> 01:02:59.669
Anthony Taylor:  Then, from that forecast data, they want you to get y hat or up group, etc.,

703
01:02:59.890 --> 01:03:03.240
Anthony Taylor: alright, and just pull that

704
01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:05.160
Anthony Taylor: and then display the app.

705
01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:10.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now, we're giving you 30 min to do this. We're not giving you a lot of stuff. But I will tell you

706
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.259
Anthony Taylor: other than. And even this, we've done just not today.

707
01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:16.630
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

708
01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:23.209
Anthony Taylor: we've done averages before, and they want the average of of best worse, and most likely. So

709
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:25.500
Anthony Taylor: you know your Y hat. Y

710
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:27.810
upper y lower.

711
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:36.270
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Everything in here you have done either today or recent. Okay, but got 30 min. So take your time.

712
01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:39.389
Anthony Taylor: Treat it like almost like a challenge.

713
01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:45.009
Anthony Taylor: Alright, cause. It's probably remarkably similar to your challenge.

714
01:03:46.090 --> 01:03:49.549
Anthony Taylor: Okay, is it, Brando? I know you finished it

715
01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:54.030
Anthony Taylor: is this very similar? Okay? Good. Alright.

716
01:03:54.990 --> 01:04:00.230
Anthony Taylor: alright guys, 30 minutes. I don't even know what I'm gonna do while you're gone that long.

717
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:06.099
Anthony Taylor: It's gonna like, I wanna probably nap or something. I don't even know like, what.

718
01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:08.120
Anthony Taylor: huh?

719
01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:10.769
Anthony Taylor: Did you say? Beer

720
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.440
michael mcpherson: beer? I don't. I don't do beer.

721
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:15.820
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

722
01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:19.959
Anthony Taylor: No, I think I'm gonna practice the Elmsley count

723
01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:22.819
Anthony Taylor: is what I'm gonna practice while you guys are doing.

724
01:04:23.410 --> 01:04:25.380
Anthony Taylor: Hi. ready?

725
01:04:25.530 --> 01:04:27.570
Anthony Taylor: 30 min have fun.

726
01:04:36.050 --> 01:04:38.189
Anthony Taylor: That is a long one.

727
01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:39.200
Anthony Taylor: I'm

728
01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:44.799
Anthony Taylor: Hafton asked a question when he came back, that, hey? Are we gonna do hyper parameters and prop it?

729
01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:51.739
Anthony Taylor: You guys don't really know what hyper parameters are yet, but I will give you a quick heads up. I remember I was talking about tuning a model.

730
01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:56.119
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Well, tuning a model is done via

731
01:04:57.110 --> 01:04:58.660
Anthony Taylor: hyper parameters.

732
01:04:59.110 --> 01:05:05.790
Anthony Taylor: Alright, and there can be hundreds of them. It looks like for profit. There's about 15.

733
01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:07.649
Anthony Taylor: We're not going to tune them

734
01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:10.069
but today, anyway.

735
01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:14.440
Anthony Taylor: event, as we actually have a whole week

736
01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:17.220
of machine learning optimization.

737
01:05:17.490 --> 01:05:25.949
Anthony Taylor: I'm pretty sure they'll come up there, and we'll talk about different ways to models. But it will have a lot more models to choose from at that point.

738
01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:29.460
Anthony Taylor: And you'll get to see how that works. It's pretty exciting.

739
01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:36.559
Anthony Taylor: But no, we're not going to do that. Today's literally the last day of profit. and that was the last activity of profit.

740
01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:39.860
Anthony Taylor: Hey, Kev.

741
01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:42.590
Kevin Nguyen: yeah.

742
01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:45.470
Anthony Taylor: I cannot get to the group sheet.

743
01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:46.810
Kevin Nguyen: Okay.

744
01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:50.110
Anthony Taylor: I was looking. I wanted to go look at it, and

745
01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:54.190
Anthony Taylor: because I want to show it to them. But I need to see it before I show it to them.

746
01:05:55.350 --> 01:06:04.279
Anthony Taylor: So either email it or like drop it in slack or something. So I can see it. Okay, anybody have any problem with that.

747
01:06:07.790 --> 01:06:09.330
Anthony Taylor: everybody finish it.

748
01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:12.350
Clayton Graves: I know some people came close.

749
01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:17.250
Anthony Taylor: I'm bummed. II thought.

750
01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.570
michael mcpherson: did you like

751
01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:24.110
michael mcpherson: no, the other 2 finished. I'm stuck on the notebook before last.

752
01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:26.560
michael mcpherson: but I keep it.

753
01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:29.440
Anthony Taylor: You shouldn't have been working on the notebook before last

754
01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:33.839
michael mcpherson: the the section.

755
01:06:34.410 --> 01:06:38.530
michael mcpherson: Oh, okay. Very last one. Display the average forecasted price.

756
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:43.220
michael mcpherson: I'm 2021 day to frame

757
01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:46.220
michael mcpherson: contains just stuff. Pretty good.

758
01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:51.919
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So we got our file. We're gonna feed it into a data frame.

759
01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:53.889
Baro, Sonja: Need to share string up.

760
01:06:53.970 --> 01:06:58.110
Anthony Taylor: Oh, sorry! At least I was reporting. Got one thing right or not.

761
01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:07.969
Anthony Taylor: Oh, thank you. I was like, what was that? And it was Kevin.

762
01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:19.460
Anthony Taylor:  alright. So we're going to plot the closing value. Pretty interesting stuff, Bitcoin.

763
01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:23.220
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, you can tell. This was not recent.

764
01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:26.940
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to reset the index

765
01:07:27.570 --> 01:07:35.919
Anthony Taylor: do our Ds. Y. We'll take a quick peek at it. 30,000 rows, 2 columns.

766
01:07:37.370 --> 01:07:38.919
Anthony Taylor: We're going to sort it

767
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:43.630
Anthony Taylor: lowest, highest

768
01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:46.960
Anthony Taylor: plot it again without the index

769
01:07:48.210 --> 01:07:54.389
Anthony Taylor: interesting. Okay? So we can see our date going across and then

770
01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:06.230
Anthony Taylor: alright. So far, so good. We're gonna model fit. This will take a second. And then

771
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:15.079
Anthony Taylor: we'll create. And we're not going to predict yet, why aren't we predicting? Because we don't have our fake data yet. So we need to create some additional periods, 40 days!

772
01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:16.920
Anthony Taylor: 1,000 h!

773
01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:22.710
Anthony Taylor: Whenever it gives us a chance. We will do that.

774
01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:33.850
Anthony Taylor: Anybody ready to go jump on Bitcoin investing

775
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:36.450
Anthony Taylor: after running this

776
01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:38.690
michael mcpherson: already. Have some.

777
01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:48.019
Anthony Taylor: Oh, I have some, too. I have a lot of Doge point. I think I have like 400 million Doge going. I think they're worth like $12

778
01:08:51.529 --> 01:08:53.810
Mason, Natalie: where it's more than nfts.

779
01:08:55.029 --> 01:09:07.029
Anthony Taylor: They're also. So I'm not gonna say stupid. II said back to pick my team. Now that I go. Yes, a lot of people made a lot of money. I would have made a lot of money, but I got out of it too soon

780
01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:13.430
Anthony Taylor: I bought like I don't know 10 bitcoin like back when they were like a dollar.

781
01:09:14.189 --> 01:09:20.490
Anthony Taylor: and then when they got to like $10, I went. Oh, my God, I'm selling these things!

782
01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:26.259
michael mcpherson: Well, it's okay. Some some guy gave away like.

783
01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:29.319
michael mcpherson: what? What? A 1,000 for a pizza!

784
01:09:30.609 --> 01:09:43.850
Anthony Taylor: But here's the stupid. While we're waiting for this. Oh, now it's done. I will say this, since we're talking about Bitcoin Dell. When I worked for Dell. they actually were accepting Bitcoin for laptops.

785
01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:49.219
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, I want you guys think about that for just sec.

786
01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:54.540
Anthony Taylor: This was Bitcoin was probably around $2,000 at.

787
01:09:54.930 --> 01:09:59.640
Anthony Taylor: so you could buy a laptop, a good laptop. one Bitcoin.

788
01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:07.420
Anthony Taylor: Then Bitcoin went from 2,000 to 50,000,

789
01:10:08.650 --> 01:10:11.950
Anthony Taylor: so that $2,000 laptop with her desk.

790
01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:26.229
Anthony Taylor: I mean depreciated negative. 48,000 like the craziest thing I like. Nobody will will go for this, and business aren't going to go for it either. What if they gave change.

791
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:29.480
Anthony Taylor: Oh, but we'll give you your change in Bitcoin.

792
01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:35.049
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, that's stupid. Alright. So here we trended it can't really steal a lot.

793
01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:38.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but it's pretty tight.

794
01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:50.039
Anthony Taylor: so it must have done something right here. We'll see better in our trends. So we'll run our individual components. The cool thing about this is, it breaks it down for us. We don't even need to know

795
01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:52.510
Anthony Taylor: which components it's going to use

796
01:10:52.690 --> 01:11:05.570
Anthony Taylor: it. Typically, it looks like it's going to break it down. Obviously, it's not always just trended weekly. We've seen trend year weekly. We've sent daily. So it's going to break it down in the components that it naturally can.

797
01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:10.200
Anthony Taylor: So here, you see the trend, it goes up, it goes down, goes up, it goes down, and we're playing

798
01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:12.950
Anthony Taylor: okay.

799
01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:20.340
Anthony Taylor: Weekly. Even Mondays don't buy it or actually buy. They'll sell on Mondays.

800
01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:25.810
Anthony Taylor: Okay, everybody's pumped because you know the weekend.

801
01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:33.490
Anthony Taylor: and maybe they sold a whole bunch over the weekend, because for some reason Bitcoin traders are watching it on weekends.

802
01:11:35.050 --> 01:11:37.799
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but apparently Mondays they don't care

803
01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:40.690
Anthony Taylor: yearly.

804
01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:44.219
Anthony Taylor: This looks good. This looks good throughout the year.

805
01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:51.740
Anthony Taylor: It's like around Summertime Mother's Day, instead of buying presents for their mothers. They're buying Bitcoin.

806
01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:53.990
Anthony Taylor: I believe that

807
01:11:54.670 --> 01:12:00.019
Anthony Taylor: hours of the day, of course, as we know, most fraudulent activities

808
01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.630
Anthony Taylor: happened in the middle of the night.

809
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.380
Anthony Taylor: And look at that. That's when they're buying big boy.

810
01:12:08.850 --> 01:12:09.970
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

811
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:14.720
Anthony Taylor: So I don't know what that means. I just know

812
01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:18.949
Anthony Taylor: I don't. I lost a lot of money because I sold my bitcoin too soon.

813
01:12:19.570 --> 01:12:25.960
Anthony Taylor: Maybe I'm bitter. alright. So here's the best. the worst. probably where it is

814
01:12:27.370 --> 01:12:28.330
Anthony Taylor: not bad.

815
01:12:28.990 --> 01:12:38.750
Anthony Taylor: right? Not terrible. 54,000, 49,000. 52,000. I'm going to invest at least in 5 or 6 votes.

816
01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:42.230
Anthony Taylor: Alright, just with that range low, right?

817
01:12:43.890 --> 01:12:45.510
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

818
01:12:47.690 --> 01:12:52.460
Anthony Taylor: You guys do know that. II do understand that Bitcoin did really. Really? Well.

819
01:12:52.480 --> 01:13:03.129
Anthony Taylor: I don't think it's gonna come back very strong. But that's just my personal opinion. and it is by no education whatsoever on economics. Mike.

820
01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:09.010
Anthony Taylor: you're my economics. Guy wouldn't Bitcoin fall under economics.

821
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:13.050
michael mcpherson: Yeah. everything does.

822
01:13:13.630 --> 01:13:16.550
Anthony Taylor: Oh, never mind. Okay, so

823
01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:36.650
Anthony Taylor: I can explain that. But it's a no, I know everything does. I don't get a lot like the Bitcoin fall. Okay, anyway. Here, we're just gonna break down those 2 columns. Gonna rename them best, most likely. And then we're just gonna average. I mean there was nothing. Here, guys, dot me.

824
01:13:36.970 --> 01:13:41.569
Anthony Taylor: that's it. Can you scroll back up to the rename so I can see. Sure. Sure.

825
01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:42.719
Anthony Taylor: Oh, this one.

826
01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.980
michael mcpherson: Yeah, that's the one I missed. Yeah.

827
01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:50.049
Anthony Taylor: it's just not renewing the columns. But you could have done that other way, too, with the list.

828
01:13:50.370 --> 01:13:52.100
Anthony Taylor: But it doesn't matter whichever.

829
01:13:56.330 --> 01:14:03.129
Anthony Taylor: So here we're using Loke, we're sending. This is the range of dates we want, and these are the columns we want.

830
01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:07.149
Anthony Taylor: And then here you're just going to rename those columns the best, worst. Most likely

831
01:14:13.150 --> 01:14:17.450
Anthony Taylor: there is some editorial in this class, if you haven't figured that out yet.

832
01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:21.119
Anthony Taylor: and some of it's actually thought out.

833
01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:22.660
Clayton Graves: I'm good. Thank you.

834
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:28.900
Anthony Taylor: Awesome. Hi, alright! Give me 1 s guys. Stop sharing for a second. I'm okay.
