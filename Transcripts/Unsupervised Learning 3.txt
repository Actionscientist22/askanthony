1
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.430
Anthony Taylor: On.

2
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.729
Anthony Taylor: and I will record the extra review anyway.

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.279
Anthony Taylor:  but try to stay. If you can usually make your life easier. If you're here.

4
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.329
Anthony Taylor: you can see I'm actually working on 2. This is the one we're gonna do today. We're gonna do lang chain

5
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:31.890
Anthony Taylor: coming up in the near future. which, like that stuff that Natalie put in general slack for the agents. We'll get to that as well

6
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.600
Anthony Taylor: at some point, because I don't think they'll cover that

7
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.630
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna the stuff we're gonna cover is a lot deeper.

8
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.579
Anthony Taylor: Then Openai and link chain.

9
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.900
Anthony Taylor: It's like how to get your data into the Llm. It's we're gonna get to that

10
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.500
Anthony Taylor: later, like towards the end.

11
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.310
Anthony Taylor: anyway. hiking today. principal component analysis.

12
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.459
Anthony Taylor: everybody ready. super exciting.

13
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:19.040
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna explain it. We're going to explain how to use it. For to reduce density dimensionality in data very important. we're gonna conceptualize how it works with a means.

14
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.940
Anthony Taylor: And we're going to use it to actually

15
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.100
Anthony Taylor: reduce features.

16
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.210
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

17
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.129
Anthony Taylor: everybody know. Okay. So II said a couple of words there. And and

18
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.980
Anthony Taylor: I had such a wonderful conversation before prior to beginning a class of office hours today. I want to make sure everybody understands these words.

19
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.189
Anthony Taylor: dimensionality. Anybody wanna define that for me

20
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.209
michael mcpherson: it is the number of versus the height.

21
00:01:50.040 --> 00:02:02.720
Anthony Taylor: No, sir, but thank you, Mike, go ahead, Matt. It's the number of variables associated with every data point. So essentially, if every row is an item or a data point. It's the number of columns in your array.

22
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.719
Anthony Taylor: There you go. right. So if you're trying to do, if you're trying to cluster.

23
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.539
Anthony Taylor: I don't know a bunch of shopping data, and you have 50 columns. You have 50 dimensions.

24
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.070
Anthony Taylor: Now, here's where it's gonna get weird

25
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.240
Anthony Taylor: number of features.

26
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.049
Anthony Taylor: Go ahead, Matt. I only have a Matt. Do it again. Because guess what?

27
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.740
Anthony Taylor: Same answer.

28
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.990
Dipinto, Matt: Okay, I was. Gonna say, I don't know if I can differentiate this.

29
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.380
Anthony Taylor: You can't. It's just same way as another way of saying the same thing.

30
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.009
Anthony Taylor: Okay, the number of features is the number of

31
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.059
Anthony Taylor: in this case. Columns that are contributing to the output.

32
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.960
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so a dimension feature interchangeable.

33
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:57.170
Anthony Taylor: Don't worry about why they use the same thing. Probably the people who wrote it didn't realize they were interchangeable. I don't. But they are okay.

34
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.700
Anthony Taylor: So yeah. So we'll get through that. Hmm.

35
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.139
Anthony Taylor: okay, well, we're gonna start with

36
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.280
Anthony Taylor: just a plain old activity.

37
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.070
Oh, it's a student activity, a piggy dog.

38
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.240
Anthony Taylor: Let's see what it is.

39
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.740
Anthony Taylor: Standardizing cholesterol. Okay, yeah. So alright. So basically.

40
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:35.419
Anthony Taylor: you gotta read instant data. You gotta do standard scalar. create a new data frame. do get dummies. All the things we just did yesterday. Okay, this is just review. Let's look and see what they give you.

41
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:43.040
Anthony Taylor: They give you the data frame. They tell you exactly what to do.

42
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.369
Anthony Taylor: They're not gonna make you do the elbow. You just gotta do 3

43
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.210
Anthony Taylor: I do believe they're gonna have you do birch, though? Yep.

44
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.279
Anthony Taylor: So you're gonna do one in birch, one in K-means.

45
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.040
Anthony Taylor: And that's it. Okay?

46
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.629
Anthony Taylor: So not simple. I don't expect you guys to to fly through it.

47
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.689
Anthony Taylor: but I don't expect it should take too long.

48
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.480
Anthony Taylor: They're gonna give you 20 min to do it. So here's what we'll do.

49
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.579
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna give you the full 20 min. and if you guys keep done early. Come on back.

50
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.060
Anthony Taylor: Okay. If everybody comes back early we'll just keep going.

51
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.530
Anthony Taylor: Otherwise, full 20 min deal.

52
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.460
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

53
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:35.740
Anthony Taylor: that doesn't mean rush through it. Try to understand it. Welcome back like.

54
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:47.400
Anthony Taylor: maybe that was harder than I expected. It's long, it's still long. It was really long, I know. And that's a lot of the activities today are just that. really. Oh.

55
00:04:48.170 --> 00:05:05.089
Raugewitz, Tania:  And it's did something change in the I think it was Antonio was. I'm telling us that. So I'm sorry, Alberto. Please forgive me, but when we run it we get true and false versus zeros and ones

56
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:22.899
Anthony Taylor: we never got zeros and ones. Did you guys get zeros and ones this time. No. But in the out in the output table it's either via via studio or Jupiter change. But yeah, okay, okay, yeah, we remember I was seeing it yesterday, too. I'm used to seeing zeros ones. They're not

57
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.400
Raugewitz, Tania: true and false. But remember.

58
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.179
Anthony Taylor: still the same thing. It's it's it is still 0, and one, even though it says true, false. Yes.

59
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.040
Gebrekristos, Hafton: if you convert it to, you can get zeros in once.

60
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.460
Gebrekristos, Hafton: That's how we did it

61
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:46.380
Anthony Taylor: well, but you don't need to do that. You really don't, don't, don't. I mean, it's cool that you did, or you're right. There's nothing wrong with that.

62
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:54.240
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so I want you guys to know that was a fine solution. But you don't need to do

63
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.700
Anthony Taylor: alright.

64
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:05.599
Anthony Taylor: I don't know how much they gave you. So we're just gonna go through it. So we're gonna import everything and create a data file.

65
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.890
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

66
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:15.920
Anthony Taylor: so we're gonna start with a standard scalar. Now, when we look at our data, it's really clear what 2 columns we're gonna scale, right?

67
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:28.530
Anthony Taylor: There's 3 columns there. One of them is letters. So pretty much. It's going to be these 2 guys alright. So we're gonna pass them in and get our scaled data

68
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:41.450
Anthony Taylor: and standardized very nice. Now, we're going to put that back into the data frame or into a data frame. Okay?

69
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.849
Anthony Taylor: And then we're gonna get our dummies

70
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.100
Anthony Taylor: for these values. Okay.

71
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:56.209
Anthony Taylor: so we'll do that and see what that looks like. Pretty exciting. It's a lot of fields right

72
00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.329
Anthony Taylor: now. We're gonna put those 2 together. We'll end up with

73
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.599
Anthony Taylor: scaled scaled zeros and what's pros and false.

74
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.519
Anthony Taylor: perfect, ready to go.

75
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.510
Anthony Taylor: Everybody agree that that is prepped data.

76
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.709
Anthony Taylor: Okay, moving forward?

77
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:25.360
Anthony Taylor: So when it says, Do it came in with 3. That should be easy.

78
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:30.150
Anthony Taylor: Alright, we've done that for quite a while now. So we'll do that

79
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.269
Anthony Taylor: great. I'm not sure the point of printing all of that

80
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.400
Anthony Taylor: question.

81
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:41.070
Baro, Sonja: Yeah, can you go back up just real quick? I wanna right there.

82
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.630
Baro, Sonja: I'm good. I we have time. I will take time.

83
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:53.759
Raugewitz, Tania: I am getting an error, and I gone over this. I don't know how many end clusters. Well, then, let's see it. Let's see, I'm excited. I want to see an error.

84
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.549
Raugewitz, Tania: Oh. stick with me, kid.

85
00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.350
Anthony Taylor: Ha, ha!

86
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.610
Raugewitz, Tania: Okay, I'm sharing now.

87
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.239
Raugewitz, Tania: This is where I'm getting an error.

88
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:16.930
Anthony Taylor: Feature names are only supported. If all input, features have string names. Go up

89
00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:25.700
Anthony Taylor: so on this interest. Differential. And next month

90
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.329
Anthony Taylor: something's wrong. Scroll up

91
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.650
Anthony Taylor: a

92
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.599
Anthony Taylor: yeah. So no

93
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:48.169
Anthony Taylor: looks no what is wrong there because it didn't do it. There

94
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.370
Anthony Taylor: didn't do it there

95
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.480
Anthony Taylor: concat

96
00:08:55.570 --> 00:09:02.619
Anthony Taylor: great Df scale countries encoded. But it did do it here.

97
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.189
Anthony Taylor: That's just weird. I wonder what that is.

98
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:12.810
Raugewitz, Tania: And are these supposed to be in parentheses with the yeah, no, they should be. They should just be normal columns. That's what it's struggling with.

99
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:14.120
Anthony Taylor: but

100
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:19.760
Anthony Taylor: I don't see off the top. Let's go all the way back, you know what? Let's do this.

101
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.839
Anthony Taylor: Oh, wait!

102
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:23.320
Anthony Taylor: Let's go back down real quick

103
00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:25.310
Anthony Taylor: stuff there.

104
00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:32.339
Anthony Taylor: No, I mean, you don't need to do that. That's fine.

105
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:40.430
Anthony Taylor: So you did. Standard scalar, fit, transform. See? Everything's perfect, you know what? Let's go up and restart your colonel and let's run

106
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.049
Anthony Taylor: back down to there.

107
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.590
Raugewitz, Tania: Okay. like that. Is that how I start my kernel?

108
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:49.040
Anthony Taylor: Yes, ma'am, just restart that, and then run each cell.

109
00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.580
Raugewitz, Tania: Okay, it's thinking

110
00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:54.410
Anthony Taylor: it's good. Now

111
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.430
Anthony Taylor: I see they're still perfect. There.

112
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:12.529
Anthony Taylor: this is perfect. Now run that one, and that's wrong.

113
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.140
Anthony Taylor: That is so weird. Why is that wrong?

114
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.870
Anthony Taylor: No, that's wrong, there's no doubt.

115
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:30.719
Anthony Taylor: Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, axis, go down where it says access. You have. No, this is equals. Huh! My sorry my eyes aren't good.

116
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.469
Anthony Taylor: Alright! Those guys can tell me what's wrong.

117
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.689
Anthony Taylor: as I sure don't see it.

118
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:48.190
Meredith McCanse (she/her): If you scroll back up. Does it have to do with it? Looks like you like sort of renamed the data frame

119
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:53.629
Meredith McCanse (she/her): a couple of times. Or I might be wrong.

120
00:10:54.590 --> 00:11:03.590
Raugewitz, Tania: This is our initial. This is our scale standard scale. And II use

121
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.169
Raugewitz, Tania: well, cause that's what it said to do in the read, me

122
00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:08.700
Anthony Taylor: hit it now.

123
00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:14.540
Anthony Taylor: okay, so that's what we need to get rid of. Yeah. Comment out one of those comment out that.

124
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.560
Raugewitz, Tania: So that's why they're still in there.

125
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:31.790
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Well doing it twice means you effectively standardized it twice.

126
00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.670
Anthony Taylor: That's nothing.

127
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.760
Anthony Taylor: Probably not, but something weird going on there. Let's figure it out.

128
00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:45.499
Raugewitz, Tania: You probably had start over, but that's okay. Try it.

129
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:53.160
Anthony Taylor: Go up and then and then restart your kernel, and then run each one and see if that fixed it. If not, we'll take a look at it after

130
00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.410
Anthony Taylor: yeah. Cause there's something weird. I'm sure it's just something simple.

131
00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:04.810
Anthony Taylor: Okay. it's just one of those things that's not jumping out at alright. So

132
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:10.400
Anthony Taylor: I'm just quickly looking at what you just did or what what you had in there.

133
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:11.600
See? That's not working.

134
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.770
Anthony Taylor: I'm just super interested in. Why, that's failing like that. So there's the fit transform. Then move it to a table.

135
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:20.460
Anthony Taylor: Huh?

136
00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:26.339
Anthony Taylor: Alright, we'll figure it out alright, continuing. So we have our 3 cluster K-means.

137
00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:29.540
Anthony Taylor: Then we're gonna make a copy of it.

138
00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:37.719
Anthony Taylor: Put the predictions in and show that. So now we have our same data, but it has which cluster was assigned to

139
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:43.589
Anthony Taylor: at the end over here. Okay. we're gonna plot it out. See what it looks like.

140
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.819
Anthony Taylor: That's the data we're going to use to plot. Here's the plot.

141
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:50.960
Anthony Taylor: and there you go.

142
00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:55.889
Anthony Taylor: Pretty nice. Okay. 3 clusters. Yay.

143
00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:59.489
Anthony Taylor: now let's use birch.

144
00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:10.259
Anthony Taylor: except this time we're gonna do 5 clusters. So exactly the same code as K-meanscept are going to change it to purch.

145
00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:12.910
Anthony Taylor: That is all.

146
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.089
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now, it's a birch

147
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.759
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna do the exact same thing here to add the column.

148
00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.490
Anthony Taylor: and then we're going to do the exact same thing here.

149
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:30.820
Anthony Taylor: But now we've printed it out with 5

150
00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:31.740
Anthony Taylor: Lesters.

151
00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.969
Anthony Taylor: Okay. any questions to hear.

152
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:42.620
Anthony Taylor: Models are simple switching models is actually really. Oh, that's the end.

153
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:49.890
Anthony Taylor: That's the end. So any questions on any of that. Yes, Merrick.

154
00:13:50.340 --> 00:14:01.280
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So that last question at the very bottom, it says, based on this plot, which cluster of country appears to provide both the highest interest spread and currency return.

155
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:04.240
Meredith McCanse (she/her): How do you know that from here like?

156
00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:09.450
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Is it asking, or go ahead? No, you're you're good.

157
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:14.149
Anthony Taylor: No, no. So it's really asking you which one looks like it's clustered the best.

158
00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:20.150
Anthony Taylor: And when you look at it this way, it's pretty obvious, right? You can see

159
00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:24.049
Anthony Taylor: 3 very clear Busters.

160
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.550
Anthony Taylor: Okay. not much overlap

161
00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:40.310
Anthony Taylor: right? Because that would make it. That would make a cluster less clear. Does everybody agree with that? If there was overlap so like, if some of these green dots were all mixed into this blue or this.

162
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:46.840
Anthony Taylor: whatever this color is. Okay. I mean, I think that's blue also. but it's less blue.

163
00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:54.110
Anthony Taylor: anyway. That would make it less of a clear cluster. When we look at the birch one

164
00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:58.929
Anthony Taylor: that looks like someone dripped a bunch of paint.

165
00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.740
Anthony Taylor: This is clearly not

166
00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:05.580
Anthony Taylor: a good breakdown of the cluster.

167
00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:12.420
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we would need to tune this one quite a bit. It's possible maybe Birch should have been 3 also

168
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.439
Anthony Taylor: right, which is easy enough to test right. Come up here.

169
00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:25.610
Anthony Taylor: change it to a 3, run it. run it running.

170
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.060
Anthony Taylor: Even with that. I don't like the Birchout.

171
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:36.670
Anthony Taylor: You guys see why, see all this overlap here. then, this is just crazy.

172
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:41.539
Anthony Taylor: and this is just bad. So the birch one. I don't like it in this, in this particular situation?

173
00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:54.930
Anthony Taylor: Pretty cool. Answer your question. Feel good about that. Everybody feel mostly warm and fuzzy. Tanya. Did we fix your problem. Dang it, we are going to figure it out

174
00:15:55.140 --> 00:16:02.609
Anthony Taylor: one way or another. Okay. but let's move forward. and we'll come back to that one if it still happens.

175
00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:07.100
Anthony Taylor:  Pca.

176
00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.110
Anthony Taylor: okay. So here.

177
00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:20.439
Anthony Taylor:  we're we're bringing in the same stuff. Nothing new.

178
00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:26.880
Anthony Taylor: Okay. we're gonna bring in the credit card info. We've been working a lot with. Alright

179
00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:32.560
Anthony Taylor: notice, they've already done the one hot coating on a lot of this.

180
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.419
Anthony Taylor: Everybody see that?

181
00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:45.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Secondary default, other post-grad primary. So they've already done that. They've already actually looks like they've already clustered it to be honest with you.

182
00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:52.270
Anthony Taylor: But so they have all this. It's standardized good to go. Okay, so we're gonna plot it out.

183
00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:56.680
Anthony Taylor: This is what they gave us. Yes, Mayor.

184
00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:01.330
Meredith McCanse (she/her): did you call it one hot key coding.

185
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:03.160
Anthony Taylor: one hot end. Cody.

186
00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.140
Meredith McCanse (she/her): One hot end coding.

187
00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:09.929
Anthony Taylor: Yes, that's what this this technique will do. That's what dummy is doing.

188
00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:10.869
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay.

189
00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:15.419
Baro, Sonja: H, right HOT. Not NOT.

190
00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:18.410
Anthony Taylor: One hot like.

191
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:19.690
Baro, Sonja: thank you.

192
00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:24.890
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. You don't say no. Ask.

193
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:39.449
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So then, now notice, we're so we're doing the scatterplot on limit balance age, and these look very nicely

194
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:44.180
Anthony Taylor: split. But what if we did the scanner plot on Bill amount and pay amount?

195
00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.159
Anthony Taylor: Let's see what they look like.

196
00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:49.140
Anthony Taylor: One

197
00:17:53.120 --> 00:18:01.729
Anthony Taylor: same clustering. totally different. Okay. Now, the the idea behind that

198
00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.190
Anthony Taylor: get that up on the screen.

199
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:11.619
Anthony Taylor:  the idea behind this

200
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:12.810
Anthony Taylor: different

201
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:17.229
Anthony Taylor: I is is, it's clear that these clusters are not

202
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:20.049
Anthony Taylor: as clean when you look at these

203
00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.699
Anthony Taylor: flats here.

204
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:25.569
Anthony Taylor: Okay. it's much more difficult

205
00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:34.780
Anthony Taylor: to to segment the data in this situation. So it doesn't mean that circa means is wrong. But that means that there's too many factors.

206
00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.150
Anthony Taylor: So even though we only have a few here.

207
00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:43.670
Anthony Taylor: okay. the factors that we have are muddling up the output.

208
00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:48.090
Anthony Taylor: and while we can see, we have nice clean clusters.

209
00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:50.789
Anthony Taylor: maybe we need to adjust it.

210
00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:54.659
Anthony Taylor: and Pca is a way to do it

211
00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.570
Anthony Taylor: the the most common. Well, we'll get to. So first

212
00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:01.680
Anthony Taylor: let's back up. Let's get rid of our segments.

213
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:03.940
Anthony Taylor: We've already done the segment. Let's get rid of.

214
00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:07.130
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we'll just drop them. They're gone.

215
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:16.240
Anthony Taylor: We're going to import Pca. Now, Pca is not a model. Pca is similar to standard scalar.

216
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:23.639
Anthony Taylor: It's a algorithm that we're going to train and apply to our data both

217
00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:27.380
Anthony Taylor: when we train it. And for incoming new data.

218
00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.350
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

219
00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:37.980
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to import it. We're going to create a model of it or not a model, an instance of it

220
00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:46.310
Anthony Taylor: with calling Pca and tell it we want. In this case, we're going to say 2 components. Okay.

221
00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:52.370
Anthony Taylor:  Now, this didn't actually do anything but create the model.

222
00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.700
The algorithm

223
00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:54.939
Anthony Taylor: got to be careful with that.

224
00:19:55.620 --> 00:20:02.050
Anthony Taylor: Now we're going to do a fit transform. So this is now going to look at all of the data in here

225
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:07.800
Anthony Taylor: in the data frame and bring it down

226
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:09.880
Anthony Taylor: to 2 columns.

227
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:16.140
Anthony Taylor: because that's what we told. So let's run that now you can see we have 2 columns.

228
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:19.600
Anthony Taylor: Well, that's easy to read, isn't it.

229
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:23.600
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now.

230
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.520
Anthony Taylor: how do we know what the these 2 columns are useful at all?

231
00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.989
Anthony Taylor: Well, not yet.

232
00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:37.469
Anthony Taylor: But that's why we're going to look at the explain variance

233
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.690
Anthony Taylor: ratio.

234
00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:45.690
Anthony Taylor: So this is a property of the Ppa algorithm instance that we created.

235
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:59.820
Anthony Taylor: And it is going to give us. you could basically read these as percentages. Okay. 95.6% of the data

236
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.720
Anthony Taylor: is properly represented in this first column

237
00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:10.949
Anthony Taylor: point 2% is represented in this second column.

238
00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:14.409
Anthony Taylor: The way you would read, this is, you would add these up.

239
00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:18.819
Anthony Taylor: and what and and and that's it. It can't go over a hundred.

240
00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:22.320
Anthony Taylor: So this would be approximately

241
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:27.159
Anthony Taylor: 98, so 96, 98%.

242
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:36.489
Anthony Taylor: So with these 2 columns. we were, we are able to cover 98% of the cases

243
00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:38.750
Anthony Taylor: in this data.

244
00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:46.119
Anthony Taylor: So what did we just do? Why is that important? Well, now, instead of the clustering algorithm having to look at all of that.

245
00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:49.780
Anthony Taylor: it only has to look at these 2 columns

246
00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:53.730
Anthony Taylor: way simply

247
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.780
Anthony Taylor: like exponentially simpler.

248
00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:02.459
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And this is even more. Yes.

249
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:08.929
Meredith McCanse (she/her): it didn't decide 2 columns. We said, do we? We did.

250
00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:10.370
Anthony Taylor: Let's see if it shows it. Hold up.

251
00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:16.859
Anthony Taylor:  let's try to get it to show me the

252
00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:29.189
Anthony Taylor: the documentation, just not wanting to do it. But yeah, there, there's other arguments you could do here, which, like I can tell it, I want you to give me a variance of 98

253
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:32.169
Anthony Taylor: right? And then it'll give me

254
00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:35.070
Anthony Taylor: as few columns as it can

255
00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.929
Anthony Taylor: to give me a variance ratio of 98%.

256
00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:50.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay, which is important, like, if we have like 50 columns. right? Maybe it's just not possible to do it, too. So we could say, Give me a variance ratio of whatever your acceptable value is 95,

257
00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.130
Anthony Taylor: and it'll go.

258
00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:58.819
Anthony Taylor: and it'll bring it down as low as you can, but no lower than 95 variants reach it

259
00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:02.560
Anthony Taylor: so it could be 5 could be 10. It'll be fine.

260
00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:10.910
Meredith McCanse (she/her): And when you tell it something like 2, does it just choose 2 existing columns, or does it like consolidate everything?

261
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.170
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay.

262
00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:16.189
Anthony Taylor: yeah. So it looks at this full row and says.

263
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:22.030
Anthony Taylor: Can I fit this data trained to get all of this information into 2 columns?

264
00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:32.580
Anthony Taylor: And and it did. And then we look at how well it did. And we see that we actually in this case, the data is really simple. So 98%, that's

265
00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:43.619
Anthony Taylor: that's unheard of. You wouldn't usually use Pca for data, this small. Usually you'd be using it for these really wide tables. And if you get 90%, you're like.

266
00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.600
Anthony Taylor: Oh, thank God. okay, you're you're overjoyed.

267
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:50.499
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but you have to.

268
00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.979
Anthony Taylor: Your model has to be okay with that.

269
00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:59.599
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so think about that, you know back to you mentioned this earlier today, back to

270
00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:10.510
Anthony Taylor: the the whole discussion of banking and marketing. Remember that discussion alright. Back in a little while back banking. We can never make a mistake ever.

271
00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:13.760
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Cause

272
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:23.089
Anthony Taylor: I mean, even in healthcare, we can argue well, you know, if we write a hundred percent because we're just gonna use the model to decide if we're gonna do further testing

273
00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:27.660
Anthony Taylor: right? But banking? Oh, my God, money's your money.

274
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:35.760
Anthony Taylor: and the the world will stop because you got your ATM account. That handed off to the wrong person.

275
00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.979
Anthony Taylor: Okay, marketing. Nobody cares.

276
00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.059
Anthony Taylor: Mail out more stuff. I don't

277
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.180
Anthony Taylor: send Spam to the wrong people. That's okay.

278
00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:47.480
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

279
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:56.690
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So so sometimes a variance ratio like this would be probably an acceptable.

280
00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:02.600
Anthony Taylor: maybe not banking, but closer to the banking side. Then, like an 80

281
00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:07.379
Anthony Taylor: and 80, we might be, that's fine. Just run fast. Yeah. Hi, go ahead. If you're unmarked.

282
00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:08.520
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

283
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.890
Anthony Taylor: okay, 50. That's so good.

284
00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:18.009
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So where we looked at our variance ratio.

285
00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.040
Anthony Taylor: And we're like. we're good with this.

286
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:26.339
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So now we're gonna all we're really gonna do is take

287
00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:31.240
Anthony Taylor: this this Pca data, because notice, it's an array.

288
00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:35.770
Anthony Taylor: And we're going to put it into a data frame. And we're going to name the columns.

289
00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:39.770
Anthony Taylor: Now, you really can't name them anything meaningful.

290
00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:45.110
Anthony Taylor: because Pca's not telling us yet what's meaningful here.

291
00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:49.180
Anthony Taylor: So we're just gonna call it Pca, Pca, 2. Alright

292
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:51.009
Anthony Taylor: run that there's a data form.

293
00:25:54.500 --> 00:26:03.130
Anthony Taylor: So now we could do the whole K-means thing again. So we're going to run this. and we're gonna finish with an

294
00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:11.880
Anthony Taylor: potato frame and an elbow elbows between 3 and 4. So we're good with that.

295
00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:19.650
Anthony Taylor:  we're gonna this is that quantitative method. We're gonna look at the difference in percentage change.

296
00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:23.309
Anthony Taylor: Right, I would hold onto this case. You need it later.

297
00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.090
Anthony Taylor: So you can see from.

298
00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:31.939
Anthony Taylor: you know, we had a 67% change, 49, 32, 2821. It starts to level out

299
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.660
Anthony Taylor: right in there.

300
00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:36.319
Anthony Taylor: So we're probably gonna go with 3 or 4.

301
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:37.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

302
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:41.169
Anthony Taylor:  we're gonna do 3.

303
00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.980
Anthony Taylor: Now, notice, we're doing the Pca data.

304
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:46.749
Anthony Taylor: We run it.

305
00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:49.470
Anthony Taylor: We do a scatter

306
00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:55.909
Anthony Taylor: to get a very clean. Now the interesting thing is, can I run this scatter any other way?

307
00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:02.700
Anthony Taylor: No. there's only 2 values. So this is, there's no confusion here.

308
00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:11.089
Anthony Taylor: Alright, this is this clean, and we can see what we want to see is that it matches this more or less

309
00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:15.369
Anthony Taylor: and other than it being transposed. It does

310
00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:19.450
Anthony Taylor: okay. because that was all about.

311
00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:24.589
Anthony Taylor: So this is the reduced values, and it still matches. So we did good.

312
00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:28.029
Anthony Taylor: which we knew of what? Okay, now.

313
00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:33.109
Anthony Taylor:  there's that value again. Now, we can. Actually.

314
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.920
Anthony Taylor: this is one of my favorite parts about Pca.

315
00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:42.670
Anthony Taylor: And you guys are going to like this. This is going to go into interpretability.

316
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:48.389
Anthony Taylor: And before I run this looking at our original data.

317
00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:52.369
Anthony Taylor: Well, because we're clustering, it's kind of hard to tell.

318
00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:58.219
Anthony Taylor: right? We want to look at this. Want to figure out, what is it basing. It's clustering on well

319
00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.070
Anthony Taylor: again, because for clustering it's a little harder to tell.

320
00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:09.389
Anthony Taylor: But but some of these values carry more weight than the others. Pca. Is going to tell us which ones?

321
00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.580
Anthony Taylor: There we go.

322
00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:18.019
Anthony Taylor: So let's look and see

323
00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.109
Anthony Taylor: how that works. So

324
00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:24.449
Anthony Taylor: I do want you guys to note this the syntax. Here

325
00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.739
Anthony Taylor: we took the Pca components.

326
00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:32.200
Anthony Taylor: Oh, Pca components, T,

327
00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:41.760
Anthony Taylor: this is a property of Pca model or algorithm. And then we said, these columns from our current data frame.

328
00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:46.529
Anthony Taylor: And then we said, I want you to use the columns

329
00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:50.960
Anthony Taylor: from the original data frame as an index

330
00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.070
Anthony Taylor: by follow.

331
00:28:55.210 --> 00:29:01.569
Anthony Taylor: okay, that's going to create this table note. These are the columns from the original data frame.

332
00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:04.940
Anthony Taylor: And next to them

333
00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:09.880
Anthony Taylor: you're going to see weights. one being the highest

334
00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:16.909
Anthony Taylor: of what each of these columns contributed to the final result.

335
00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:23.110
Anthony Taylor: Really, really this final result? But

336
00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:26.239
Anthony Taylor: this all translates into how it clustered.

337
00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:30.060
Anthony Taylor: So what was the number one

338
00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.440
Anthony Taylor: feature that it considered.

339
00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:36.550
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yeah, and above

340
00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:39.260
Meredith McCanse (she/her): page

341
00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.859
Meredith McCanse (she/her): age age.

342
00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:49.550
Anthony Taylor: it basically clustered on age 99 point 9. That's nuts.

343
00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.790
Anthony Taylor: All the rest of these are fraction.

344
00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.039
Anthony Taylor: So basically, age and marriage.

345
00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:03.310
Anthony Taylor: Okay, can you tell me what the T was? Again?

346
00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:07.040
Anthony Taylor: It's just the name of the property that gives us this weight.

347
00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:11.909
Anthony Taylor: So Pca components, underscore dot, T,

348
00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:14.010
Anthony Taylor: this is the name

349
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:18.910
Anthony Taylor: that that's gonna give us these weights.

350
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:21.379
Anthony Taylor: This, it's yeah, just a propable.

351
00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:30.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So the interesting thing is that, of course, PCA. 2. The second value actually took away a little bit of this weight.

352
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.689
Anthony Taylor: which is understandable.

353
00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:45.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Otherwise, there's no point doing anything just cluster the ages. You're done. Okay. But because of all this other stuff to do it. So

354
00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:55.650
Meredith McCanse (she/her): yeah, go for it in the in the syntax where you have it, telling it which columns to use.

355
00:30:55.880 --> 00:31:02.540
Meredith McCanse (she/her): We never told it. No, so not there. But to the left, where you're telling it columns equals Pca one and Pca 2,

356
00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:06.200
Meredith McCanse (she/her): we never exposed it. Yeah, we never.

357
00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:16.190
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay. So you're not saying, pull the data from that previous data frame that used those labels. You're just saying, name the columns this.

358
00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:26.680
Anthony Taylor: where did we do it right here? See how we named them here. But you didn't refer to that data frame anywhere. How does it know that's the data frame to get it from? Did I?

359
00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.560
Anthony Taylor: Did I? Now?

360
00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:34.180
Anthony Taylor: Pd data frame? Oh, because we ran Pca. Against.

361
00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:39.139
Anthony Taylor: So it's using the model. Give us that. So in the model

362
00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:41.390
Anthony Taylor: we passed in

363
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:44.399
Anthony Taylor: for our variance.

364
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:50.930
Anthony Taylor: Getting back up to where we did it. Here we go. So

365
00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:54.770
Anthony Taylor: we ran Pca on

366
00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:57.100
Anthony Taylor: this model or this model.

367
00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:02.009
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so Pca, now, has those 2 columns in it?

368
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:04.650
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Alright, yeah.

369
00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.709
Anthony Taylor: So. And we're just, you're right. We're basically just naming it.

370
00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.070
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay.

371
00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:13.949
Anthony Taylor: does that make sense here? If you don't put this here, I don't think it would actually fail.

372
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:15.009
Anthony Taylor: Let's find out

373
00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.670
Anthony Taylor: pretty sure this would still work. Yeah.

374
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.289
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So all we're doing is just making it easier to read.

375
00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:25.079
Dipinto, Matt: You actually nailed it on your first suggestion

376
00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:38.439
Dipinto, Matt: thing I want to point out so that dot t, so I think the the actual thing so Pca dot components is what gives you those numbers. The dot T just transforms them from essentially row type to column type.

377
00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.130
Anthony Taylor: Well, that would be transpose, yeah.

378
00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.349
Dipinto, Matt: or, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry

379
00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:50.639
Dipinto, Matt: so the shape's gonna be wrong. But if you just pull the Pca components, throw them in another cell, you should get 2 rows of the data.

380
00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:55.030
Anthony Taylor: That's good. That's good, great, great observation.

381
00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:57.829
Anthony Taylor: But to do this, you have to put that deep.

382
00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:00.450
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

383
00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:08.449
Anthony Taylor: so this is really cool. This shows us how our cluster cluster.

384
00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:14.339
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Because remember why I told you just yesterday I told you really hard to do. Now.

385
00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.630
Anthony Taylor: it's still really hard to do unless you do. Pca.

386
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:20.400
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

387
00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:25.929
Anthony Taylor: Pca adds an extra layer that you can use to do some interpretability.

388
00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:31.159
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So which features age by last.

389
00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:36.830
Anthony Taylor: okay, limit, balance, limit, balance bill amount and pay amount

390
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:40.879
Anthony Taylor: for the second one had a lot to do with it.

391
00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:43.310
Anthony Taylor: Okay, yeah. Time

392
00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:49.730
Anthony Taylor: muted.

393
00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:54.240
Raugewitz, Tania: Oh, I thought you were gonna unmute me.

394
00:33:54.890 --> 00:34:00.419
Anthony Taylor: I can't unmute you. That's one thing I can't do. I can use you, but I can't unmute you.

395
00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:12.109
Raugewitz, Tania: Okay, so my bad for the the 3 models. So is it one of those things where it's K-means is used often, but more often than not

396
00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:27.829
Anthony Taylor: the Pca is going to be the default that is used because of.

397
00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:35.769
Raugewitz, Tania: but it's used with or birch, or it is used in tandem, in tandem with them.

398
00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:37.210
Anthony Taylor: Perfect.

399
00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:41.519
Anthony Taylor: That's right. And and others, by the way, we'll use this again

400
00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:44.220
Anthony Taylor: in classification and supervised.

401
00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:58.969
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you'll also use this in in deep learning alright, which is still coming in the future. Okay, deep learning sounds hard, doesn't it? We're gonna learn deep learning.

402
00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.950
Anthony Taylor: It does cool thing

403
00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:08.240
Anthony Taylor: model bid predict.

404
00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:13.310
Anthony Taylor: The model takes one extra step, but not bad.

405
00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.579
Anthony Taylor: Okay, any other questions.

406
00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:24.420
Anthony Taylor: So let's just go back to the beginning, real quick and kind of walk through it all without all the blubber in the middle.

407
00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.139
Anthony Taylor: Okay. we have our data.

408
00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:32.869
Anthony Taylor: The State has already standardized. clustered. We're just looking at it.

409
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:42.100
Anthony Taylor: This is the only one we care about. This was just showing you. It's not always perfect. Now let's go back to what you're going to do in the next exercise. Yeah, there

410
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:47.059
Derek Rikke: is there ever any reason you wouldn't use Pca

411
00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:58.279
Anthony Taylor: because it'll lower the quality of your model. Now, in this case really doesn't cause we got 98% coverage

412
00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:04.200
Anthony Taylor: right? But there will be times you go use Pca. And you can't get better. 70

413
00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:08.470
Anthony Taylor: alright. And in that case you don't wanna use.

414
00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:10.430
Anthony Taylor: or.

415
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:17.099
Anthony Taylor: you know, back to my like, 50 columns, example or 50 features example, if it only lowers it by one or 2,

416
00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:18.990
Anthony Taylor: and you lose any

417
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:25.200
Anthony Taylor: Co. quality, then there's no point cause you're not gaining anything at it.

418
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:34.030
Anthony Taylor: Right? So the idea is is through the most important. So but let me ask you, let me let me present it to you guys this way.

419
00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:39.359
Anthony Taylor: what is the most expensive part of machine learning.

420
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:41.440
Raugewitz, Tania: training.

421
00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:44.479
Anthony Taylor: training? But why

422
00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:47.329
Baro, Sonja: time, time? Hi.

423
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:54.620
Anthony Taylor: CPU time. right? Matt wrote a thing earlier, and he said he was looking at cloud servers to see when they were available.

424
00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:59.050
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so those servers are

425
00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:03.560
Anthony Taylor: not cheap. and they'd usually charge by the minute.

426
00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:09.050
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And it's not always a lot of money. It might be only 3 bucks an hour.

427
00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:13.989
Anthony Taylor: Okay, 3 bucks an hour is no big deal. Oh, but wait.

428
00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:17.730
Anthony Taylor: We need 20 of them to train this law.

429
00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:23.740
Anthony Taylor: Oh, now we're at 60 bucks now. Oh, and it takes 24 h to do it.

430
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:34.889
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So that is where the majority of the money and the time is spent in machine learning. Besides us, we all get paid.

431
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:48.400
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But so so a lot of what we do in machine learning. Besides, the tuning and twisting the knobs is to trying to lower that cost.

432
00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:58.409
Anthony Taylor: Because every time we train that model, if it costs $12,000, it better have one hell of a return of investment.

433
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:02.520
Anthony Taylor: because I might have to run it once a month.

434
00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:13.469
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Well, I think we were at $1,200, but either way. however much it costs, I have a model that cost several $1,000 to train

435
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:19.649
Anthony Taylor: alright, but we try to lower that down. And Pca is one of those methods.

436
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:28.520
Anthony Taylor: So Pca, we say, Hey, if we can reduce the number of features from 50 to 20 and keep 95%

437
00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:32.180
Anthony Taylor: of our. you know, possibilities

438
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:37.310
Anthony Taylor: that could speed up our training time by 12 h.

439
00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:40.390
Anthony Taylor: 10 h fiber.

440
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:47.250
Anthony Taylor: Now we're saving a bunch of money? Alright. So maybe we're willing to deal with that.

441
00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:50.349
Anthony Taylor: So anyway, is that clear? Everybody got that?

442
00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:56.059
Anthony Taylor: Alright? okay. So

443
00:38:56.190 --> 00:39:02.460
Anthony Taylor: this is basically from the exercise forward. So you're just going to have this data without the cluster

444
00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:07.009
Anthony Taylor: you're going to call Pca. You're going to give it. Let's let's do this real quick.

445
00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:15.420
Anthony Taylor: I want to grab it. So you guys can see the documentation.

446
00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:32.710
Anthony Taylor:  so note, you can do in components, which is what we're doing

447
00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.380
Anthony Taylor: okay?

448
00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:44.070
Anthony Taylor:  you can do. There's a couple other ones in here. Don't worry too much. I mean, you could read up on those if you want tolerance. So

449
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:50.219
Anthony Taylor: oh, that's not it. Or say that over sample random statement.

450
00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:54.039
Anthony Taylor: is it? Tolerance

451
00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.429
Anthony Taylor: could be tolerance

452
00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:10.839
Anthony Taylor: PIN samples in features.

453
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:16.439
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so this is, you can't go lower than that.

454
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:20.940
Anthony Taylor: I think it's tolerance.

455
00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:28.730
Anthony Taylor: Let's try it. Let's just try it.

456
00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:33.350
Anthony Taylor:  let's kind of get out.

457
00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:46.319
Anthony Taylor: Thank you. Yang.

458
00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:48.730
Anthony Taylor: okay.

459
00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.979
Anthony Taylor: so look at what it did. There.

460
00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:56.910
Anthony Taylor: you guys see what happened

461
00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:02.110
Anthony Taylor: like, how many, how many values are in a row. Now.

462
00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:07.909
Anthony Taylor: okay, so let's lower this. Let's just lower this down to like 95

463
00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:12.849
Anthony Taylor: didn't fix it, darn it

464
00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:15.750
Anthony Taylor: was hoping it would fix that. Let's see.

465
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:21.009
Anthony Taylor: Oh, my, that's a mess. Yeah. Tolerance is not what I'm thinking it is.

466
00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:26.300
Anthony Taylor:  I need to remember it. You know what? I'll look it up while you guys are your next tech team.

467
00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:28.870
Anthony Taylor: That's it, maybe because we definitely do that

468
00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:33.569
Dipinto, Matt: cause. It's at that. You know what it could be point 9 5. Thank you. That's a good thought.

469
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:37.280
Anthony Taylor: Let's try that that that that that

470
00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:45.369
Anthony Taylor: I was trying to be clever with that? Yeah.

471
00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:58.899
Anthony Taylor: I'll figure it out. Don't worry about. We'll get there.  So let's just stick within components for the moment, and then I will get you the answer to that other one. I know it can be done.

472
00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:05.309
Anthony Taylor: I'm just wondering if maybe thinking of a different model. But anyway, so here

473
00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:14.490
Anthony Taylor: we've done in clusters 2. We fit transformed it to our data. Now we can look at our variance ratio. See how we did? We did good.

474
00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:15.750
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

475
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:26.049
Anthony Taylor: now, we're gonna take this array of arrays of lists alright and create a data frame with 2 new columns.

476
00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:34.779
Anthony Taylor: Now that we have that, we just do our normal K-means stuff. Nothing new here. Okay, nothing new here.

477
00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:43.580
Anthony Taylor: We're doing it now we're gonna run it with a specific number of clusters on our Pca data

478
00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:52.199
Anthony Taylor: and take a look at it. Yay, it looks like the original. Then last. you're going to look at the weights.

479
00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:59.439
Anthony Taylor: So this is gonna be one of those activities. We're gonna want to have them side by side unless they give you these, this, these cells sounds

480
00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:01.200
Anthony Taylor: okay.

481
00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.580
Anthony Taylor: pretty straightforward.

482
00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.509
Anthony Taylor: other than my aside there, which I will solve.

483
00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:11.939
Anthony Taylor: Hi, Hi, cool.

484
00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:17.330
Anthony Taylor: Let's give you guys an exercise to work with. So

485
00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:23.969
Anthony Taylor: you gotta pull in a bunch of data. This data is already standardized.

486
00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:26.170
Anthony Taylor: Gonna bring in Pca.

487
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:30.669
Anthony Taylor: you're going to declare the number of Pca variables is that in the

488
00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:34.890
Anthony Taylor: 2?

489
00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:41.590
Anthony Taylor: Alright. declare it to 2. Well, you can see them there. Okay.

490
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:46.390
Anthony Taylor: use the explain variance ratio. See? Now, like, here's a good example.

491
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:48.400
Anthony Taylor: If this is the correct one.

492
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:51.269
Anthony Taylor: what does this total come out to?

493
00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.150
Derek Rikke: 85,

494
00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.060
Anthony Taylor: 85,

495
00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:04.399
Anthony Taylor: absolutely. So we're only getting 85%

496
00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:10.669
Anthony Taylor: of the feature set using just 2. Does that make sense to everybody?

497
00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:17.989
Anthony Taylor: This is a naked? So this is probably, I mean, maybe this is fine, certainly fine for class.

498
00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:20.980
Anthony Taylor: We're doing customer segmentation. So probably.

499
00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:29.040
Anthony Taylor: But maybe you jump it up to 3 and see if it gets better, it will. Okay, I don't know. Yeah, there's there's a lot of features there.

500
00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:35.420
Anthony Taylor:  and then you're gonna use it and create the data frame like we did in the other one

501
00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:42.339
Anthony Taylor: same here. Oh, and then you're gonna do your your for loop. Copy it from the other exercise, please.

502
00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:47.999
Anthony Taylor: and then you're gonna do with whatever you think is best bought. It

503
00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:52.739
Anthony Taylor: looks like we're going to do it again with 3.

504
00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:57.400
Anthony Taylor: And there you go and determine. And then you're gonna do the weights

505
00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:00.520
Anthony Taylor: with the dot transpose.

506
00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:03.050
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

507
00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:06.570
Anthony Taylor: I should be doable.

508
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:08.620
Anthony Taylor: We are giving you.

509
00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:30.510
Anthony Taylor: Maybe we won't have a lot of extra time. 20 min. 20 min. Alright! Welcome back. How'd you guys do? Did you good? Did you? Good?

510
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:34.010
Clayton Graves: I got to see. I see that

511
00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:37.079
Clayton Graves: I got the same when I tried it plotting.

512
00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:42.279
Clayton Graves: but I got on the first activity, and I can't figure it out.

513
00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:44.520
Clayton Graves: Well, we'll take a look.

514
00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:53.900
Anthony Taylor: Let's let's go through it, and then let's see where. Maybe you'll see the answer when we go through it. and if not, we'll take a look. You know I won't leave you hanging.

515
00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:56.850
Anthony Taylor: I won't leave you hanging

516
00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:04.869
Anthony Taylor: all right. So anybody see my broadcast, I sent the broadcast to tell you how to get

517
00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:09.790
Anthony Taylor: the percentage. Did anybody see it? Nobody saw it.

518
00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:12.160
Anthony Taylor: Your guys?

519
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.179
Anthony Taylor: Well, the funny part is, what's the broadcast.

520
00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:18.790
Anthony Taylor: yeah.

521
00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:21.630
Mason, Natalie: where? Where we supposed to see it?

522
00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:29.360
Anthony Taylor: I was playing with chat, dpt. I was asking it. What if it believed in God. It was kind of funny.

523
00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:37.600
Anthony Taylor:  it's basically still in components. You just have to change it to a percentage. Anyway, we'll get to it

524
00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:39.040
Anthony Taylor: alright. So

525
00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:44.499
Anthony Taylor: go through this. We're going to bring in the data.

526
00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:51.019
Anthony Taylor: So this one's already standard scale. So we'd like to do that. So we're going to do? Pca.

527
00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:58.530
Anthony Taylor: okay? And then it told us to do 2. So we do. 2. Alright,

528
00:46:58.730 --> 00:46:59.879
Anthony Taylor: We'll come back to

529
00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:04.150
Anthony Taylor: and then we're going to fit transform.

530
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:06.650
Anthony Taylor: Okay, the

531
00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:16.639
Anthony Taylor: one. If you wanted to be a specific thighs, you would do.

532
00:47:18.310 --> 00:47:21.359
Anthony Taylor: Let's do point 80, because we know this one's low.

533
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:27.139
Anthony Taylor: Okay? See, I did that.

534
00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:34.509
Anthony Taylor: So this is gonna make it a specific variance. So if I say, if 85 wasn't enough and I wanted it to be 95 or 90,

535
00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:40.369
Anthony Taylor: right? We know that this was, gonna give us 80. So see now, we ended up with a third.

536
00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:45.160
Anthony Taylor: See how that works. But let's go back to our instructions.

537
00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:47.769
Anthony Taylor: It said 2. So we'll do 2.

538
00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:49.690
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

539
00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:55.610
Meredith McCanse (she/her): so did you use if you put it in as a percent, it'll give you that percentage

540
00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:59.349
Anthony Taylor: right here, I'll show you. So right now, we could see 2

541
00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:02.650
Anthony Taylor: is the 85%. Right? Everybody agree.

542
00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:07.510
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So let's go back up here and change this to 90

543
00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:08.719
point 9,

544
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:13.640
Anthony Taylor: and then run this again.

545
00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:19.200
Anthony Taylor: And now, when we run this, we'll see that it's 55, 85

546
00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:23.879
Anthony Taylor: plus another 6. So now it's like 91. But

547
00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:29.349
Anthony Taylor: so it was able to give us 90 in 3 instead of the original 10.

548
00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:36.109
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so that's the other way. You can use Pca, so you can go either direction.

549
00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:40.170
Anthony Taylor: But we'll go back to the directions, for now

550
00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:48.600
Anthony Taylor: that was the thing I was trying to find earlier. And it's funny. It's the same. The same argument.

551
00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:55.169
Anthony Taylor: which is why I was having trouble finding. It's the same damn market. Okay, so about 85%.

552
00:48:55.180 --> 00:49:00.700
Anthony Taylor: So let's we're going to create the same data frame we did in the instructor example. a

553
00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:04.820
Anthony Taylor: we're going to do our elbow

554
00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:05.870
Anthony Taylor: with

555
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:08.720
Anthony Taylor: Rpca data.

556
00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:20.249
Anthony Taylor: This is gonna just populate all of that. Give us our inertia and then we'll plot it out. Okay, this one's a pretty clear 3

557
00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:26.170
Anthony Taylor: right. But all right, let's see what it has us to. Oh, look as it's 3.

558
00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:30.750
Anthony Taylor: Hi! So let's run it with 3.

559
00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:34.760
Anthony Taylor: Let's look at the the plot. That's so pretty.

560
00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:37.109
Anthony Taylor: It looks like

561
00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:51.359
Anthony Taylor: the middle finger. It's the burk. Okay, thank you for saving me on that, Mike. We were all there with you, Anthony, I was like I was, gonna say, a clover.

562
00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:57.010
Dipinto, Matt: Okay, that was my original thought. Upside down. 2 leaf clover.

563
00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.100
Raugewitz, Tania: Yeah.

564
00:49:58.250 --> 00:50:02.640
Anthony Taylor: it's a hammer. It's four's hammer. It's the genre.

565
00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:04.979
Yeah, that's what it is.

566
00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:08.720
Masarirambi, Rodney: Oh, yeah. neonatal.

567
00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:10.519
Anthony Taylor: we on your

568
00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:12.490
Masarirambi, Rodney: yeah. We saw that

569
00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:14.660
Baro, Sonja: got it. So

570
00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:22.830
Anthony Taylor: so here we got our kb's with 3. And then we're gonna plot it out.

571
00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:28.700
Anthony Taylor: Look at that. That looks a little. What would we go differently here? Oh, so this is just the original data.

572
00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:31.190
Anthony Taylor: Okay, without Pta.

573
00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:34.290
Anthony Taylor: And you can see it's okay.

574
00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:38.579
Anthony Taylor: right? It's not bad. But it's definitely not as clear a cluster.

575
00:50:38.770 --> 00:50:42.349
Anthony Taylor: We have some overlap. We have some. you know, quite a bit of overlap.

576
00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:48.630
Anthony Taylor: It doesn't mean that the other one's wrong. But remember, this is only 85% correct.

577
00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:57.620
Anthony Taylor: So while this looks great. You can clearly see that we lost whatever's inside of you.

578
00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:03.790
Anthony Taylor: All right, that's probably the 15% we lost. Aye.

579
00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:12.069
Anthony Taylor: okay. So here we're going to look at the weights be which feature was the most important.

580
00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:16.739
Anthony Taylor: Alright, this one has the pretty obvious one

581
00:51:18.490 --> 00:51:19.540
Anthony Taylor: feature night.

582
00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:24.810
Anthony Taylor: That is the most obvious one. Right? Yeah.

583
00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:27.749
Okay, feature nine's B,

584
00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:34.750
Anthony Taylor: like 86% of the weight is all on feature 9. We don't know why you have no clue.

585
00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:37.390
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

586
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:41.369
Feature 7 and feature 10 were bigger on

587
00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:43.490
Anthony Taylor: this on the second value.

588
00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:47.300
Anthony Taylor: So yeah.

589
00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:55.700
Anthony Taylor: okay, so now, if we plot just on those main features. we should get a much more similar

590
00:51:56.250 --> 00:51:59.720
plot to what we ended up with after we just did the cluster.

591
00:51:59.970 --> 00:52:01.390
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then the other one.

592
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:06.320
Anthony Taylor: There you go. There's your major and all again.

593
00:52:09.550 --> 00:52:10.380
Anthony Taylor: Alright

594
00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:17.729
Anthony Taylor: feature 910 yield similar results to Pca analysis which makes sense because they have a huge amount of weight.

595
00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:24.399
Anthony Taylor: Alright cool questions. Wait a minute.

596
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:32.269
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now it's breakdown.

597
00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:33.930
Mason, Natalie: Yeah.

598
00:52:35.950 --> 00:52:38.580
Anthony Taylor: Well, we're only 10 min past break.

599
00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:40.730
Anthony Taylor: Oh.

600
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:46.259
Anthony Taylor: okay. Whoo! I thought I was on the last exercise I'm already I'm like, what if? Alright?

601
00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:47.829
Anthony Taylor: So yes, Ronnie.

602
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:56.130
Masarirambi, Rodney: So going back to where we where we saw the weight of feature. 9.

603
00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:57.499
Anthony Taylor: So yes, this one

604
00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:06.719
Masarirambi, Rodney: in a work environment. the idea would be like, somebody would be like, Oh, we have this data. Take a look at this when it and analyze it.

605
00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:11.850
Masarirambi, Rodney: we'd see this waited in Fiji. 9, and then we'd say to them, Look there.

606
00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:21.160
Masarirambi, Rodney: and we don't necessarily we won't necessarily go in and look into that. We'll just give it somebody to who the person who provides us to the data and say, that's what you need to look into

607
00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:40.449
Anthony Taylor: what we could do. So okay, first off, you'll never data with column names like feature. Not but let's just pretend these are legitimate column. What you would do is, you would say, Hey, I clustered your data. And I did further analysis and came up with, these are the main factors, causing your clusters to be separate

608
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:43.810
Anthony Taylor: in this case, feature 9 and 10.

609
00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:48.670
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so that gives the analyst a place to start.

610
00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:51.980
Alright.

611
00:53:52.230 --> 00:54:03.390
Anthony Taylor: and so they're gonna go start there and look at the difference in feature, 9 and 10 in each cluster. and that should give them a pretty good idea of. And and again.

612
00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:07.890
Anthony Taylor: this is very student-friendly data.

613
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:12.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay, typically in your work environment, you're not going to see

614
00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:18.880
Anthony Taylor: this obvious of a weight like this. Okay?

615
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:23.890
Anthony Taylor: It's gonna be like 5 or 6 columns that are making up, or, more

616
00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:29.040
Anthony Taylor: just depends. This data is very simple.

617
00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:35.420
Anthony Taylor: So so it's pretty easy to point to them and say, Hey, go look at this

618
00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:47.830
Anthony Taylor: and this 6 and 9, and on this side, you know, and 9 and 10 on this right, and that'll help you figure out the clusters. And then your data analyst. that's their analyst thing.

619
00:54:48.670 --> 00:55:01.649
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Really, it's not even the data analyst in this case needs to be a domain expert. Right? So you're not just talking about like some like, if you guys get a job, a data analyst at a in a domain never worked in.

620
00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:06.820
Anthony Taylor: you know, like you get one in healthcare. And you've never done healthcare before.

621
00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:12.849
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that wouldn't be you doing that. It would be the person that works with this data every day.

622
00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:16.989
Anthony Taylor: looking at the differences based on the columns you've given

623
00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:19.370
Anthony Taylor: as data scientists.

624
00:55:20.410 --> 00:55:21.450
Masarirambi, Rodney: Okay? Great

625
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:23.529
Anthony Taylor: 3 questions.

626
00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:27.889
Anthony Taylor: I love, that makes me happy when I make sense.

627
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:33.650
Anthony Taylor: Hi! Any questions. No more questions.

628
00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:36.800
Alberto Aigner: Hi! You don't have something.

629
00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:39.350
Anthony Taylor: What? Oh, sorry! What? What I missed

630
00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:43.640
Alberto Aigner: just Clayton Clayton had somethin.

631
00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:45.580
Anthony Taylor: Clayton, you have a question.

632
00:55:49.490 --> 00:56:00.830
Anthony Taylor: He's thinking about it. Yeah, I had. I had an issue, and you were like, Well, sorry I didn't know. Let's let's look at it real quick as a group. Go ahead. Sorry, my bad.

633
00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:03.219
Clayton Graves: Hi, there, thank you. Alberto

634
00:56:04.850 --> 00:56:14.430
Masarirambi, Rodney: Clayton, as you as you show it. I'm gonna ask you a question, because you might have done the same thing that I did. Do you use the same the same data frame

635
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:16.670
Masarirambi, Rodney: in the second one or no.

636
00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.400
Clayton Graves: You got it.

637
00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:26.730
Clayton Graves: So I'm I'm I'm this is the same issue that I ran into on the first activity. It won't fly.

638
00:56:26.930 --> 00:56:29.510
Clayton Graves: It's telling me that

639
00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:32.720
Clayton Graves: that C has to be a color.

640
00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:40.780
Clayton Graves: The argument must be a color, a sequence of colors, or a sequence of numbers, not customer segments.

641
00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:44.719
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Show me the the your data up above.

642
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:50.529
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so that's clearly.

643
00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:55.380
Clayton Graves: are you running into that data type problem again?

644
00:56:55.910 --> 00:57:05.710
Dipinto, Matt: So you copied the data frame and the line you have highlighted up there. But then you added customer segments to your old data frame.

645
00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:11.209
Dipinto, Matt: So you want to add it to your customer. Pca predictions data frame in the lines of code right below that.

646
00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:14.890
Clayton Graves: So I need to do

647
00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:17.999
Anthony Taylor: Pca predictions data frame

648
00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:27.260
Anthony Taylor: and then do it again in the may or just that whenever you're good.

649
00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:42.100
Clayton Graves: Okay? Well, nice job. Yeah.

650
00:57:43.330 --> 00:57:46.609
Clayton Graves: Good work that does not look like a middle finger

651
00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:48.360
Clayton Graves: that looks like something else

652
00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:51.590
michael mcpherson: we're going with

653
00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:56.970
Anthony Taylor: started the recording. Now go. sir. start.

654
00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:00.910
Anthony Taylor: Cindy.

655
00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:02.760
Anthony Taylor: are you there?

656
00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:10.989
Anthony Taylor: Alright, we're gonna zoom to there. Okay? Well, the exciting thing.

657
00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:17.780
Anthony Taylor: I have nothing to say, I have just a new activity for you.

658
00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:21.469
michael mcpherson: I'm still working on that.

659
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:24.550
Anthony Taylor: Well, stop it. Sorry.

660
00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:30.299
Anthony Taylor:  alright. So this time you're going to do some stock data.

661
00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:36.739
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this is pretty cool. One. There is a lot of steps in this one. So you're gonna get.

662
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:40.070
Anthony Taylor: get ready for this 30 min

663
00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:47.109
Anthony Taylor: to do this. This is like one of the longest activities of the entire Oprah.

664
00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:51.949
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But you got 30 min. It's again.

665
00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:56.410
Anthony Taylor: guys. you know what I show you guys all the time.

666
00:58:58.130 --> 00:59:08.160
Anthony Taylor: you know. Do one of these numbers sample on one side, the other one on the other. Make a half. Okay. There's there's no reason to type a whole bunch of stuff.

667
00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:11.190
Anthony Taylor:  it looks like

668
00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:25.540
Anthony Taylor: they give you quite a bit to start with. Okay. so and then you're just gonna get here. You're gonna do a K-means with 3. You're gonna scale some data.

669
00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:31.320
Anthony Taylor: do your scatters. That's that's a weird looking scatter.

670
00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:37.750
Anthony Taylor: And then you're gonna do. Pca. alright. That's ugly.

671
00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:43.109
Anthony Taylor: How many columns are in this? There's quite a few, though.

672
00:59:45.070 --> 00:59:45.880
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

673
00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:48.320
Anthony Taylor: alright.

674
00:59:48.430 --> 00:59:51.869
Anthony Taylor: that's it. Guys knock that out and

675
00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:57.750
Anthony Taylor: we'll review, and then we'll see if we have time to do the open AI thing. Sound good.

676
00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:03.410
Anthony Taylor: I'm thinking we'll probably wait till Wednesday, because this is gonna take us to about 10 or 9 15,

677
01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:05.830
Anthony Taylor: but we'll see. All right.

678
01:00:05.850 --> 01:00:09.630
Anthony Taylor: Bye, guys, 30 min. Let me

679
01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:32.630
Anthony Taylor: welcome back

680
01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:34.770
Anthony Taylor: how we do it.

681
01:00:35.550 --> 01:00:37.080
michael mcpherson: Did you close it early.

682
01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:41.450
Anthony Taylor: No, sir. why would I do that?

683
01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:47.130
Anthony Taylor: Did I close it early? Did we only do 20 min instead of 30?

684
01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:50.170
michael mcpherson: I thought you said see it back at 9 20.

685
01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:55.450
Anthony Taylor: No, I don't. Yeah, Tyler.

686
01:00:56.380 --> 01:01:03.540
Raugewitz, Tania: you know II am understanding this, but I am having a hard time keeping all my variables straight.

687
01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:10.759
Anthony Taylor: I don't know if that's a common thing with all these

688
01:01:11.310 --> 01:01:13.640
Anthony Taylor: again, also because we're

689
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:27.540
Anthony Taylor: we're learning. Okay, we're doing a lot of steps that maybe you'll do in the real like. And and I'll actually, when we get to that point in this example, I will show you where you would probably actually like. This would be the work.

690
01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:32.370
Anthony Taylor: right? We're doing all kinds of steps. But normally, this is probably like 2 sales of both.

691
01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:35.460
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we have, like what 20 in here.

692
01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:51.999
Anthony Taylor: so we we will. I will show you. But it's a great point, and it's not on top. And do remember, though, like right here, remember, you can always like, bring this up and see all of the variables that you're currently using out all that helps because they're not in any kind of order, but it is available.

693
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:56.410
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So let's see if we can talk about that. Yes.

694
01:01:56.470 --> 01:02:11.100
Masarirambi, Rodney: Oh, Tanya, one thing that I ran into like the first site. Then the lost exercise which I tried correct this time was I didn't pay attention to the variable names that they suggested, and I got confused and stuff like that. So by doing that, that helped out quite a bit

695
01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:23.020
Anthony Taylor: right. But even if they, I mean, like, when you guys are doing this work yourselves, I mean, yes, you will. This is the importance of naming variables, something that makes sense. Right?

696
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:30.840
Anthony Taylor: That's where most people where I see they start to fall apart on variables is that they just didn't name them well.

697
01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:35.660
Anthony Taylor: and then they start getting mixed up like, oh, well, I named this one credit card info. I'm like, but

698
01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:44.529
Anthony Taylor: isn't that what you named the first data frame? Oh. well, yeah. But this is credit card info standardized like, well, how do you know that.

699
01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:45.570
Anthony Taylor: Right?

700
01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:48.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that kind of stuff. So

701
01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:53.810
Anthony Taylor: it it is a practice. It's kind of a organizational skill that you will get. But

702
01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:59.130
Anthony Taylor: we are doing a lot of extra. So let's talk about that. So the imports this wouldn't change

703
01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:09.479
Anthony Taylor:  reading in the data. And like we always do like head and shade info. None of this stuff. Would you probably really do?

704
01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:17.870
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Because you're already going to know this information? It's not, I mean, maybe the first time. But once you do it, you're not going to leave it in your notebook. You're going to delete these cells.

705
01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:35.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Cause they're not necessary every time. Run. They just this is just to get to know your data. Okay, so we're gonna pull in our data. We're gonna do a quick shape. You can see there's 30 columns. There's sorry. There's 8 columns and 30 rows.

706
01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:38.960
And then we're gonna do our info.

707
01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:43.649
Anthony Taylor: You can see our columns, and that there's all these numbers.

708
01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:46.949
Anthony Taylor: Okay. lots of numbers in it.

709
01:03:47.850 --> 01:03:54.279
Anthony Taylor: Alright, alright. So now we know that we're only going to standard scale

710
01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:55.950
Anthony Taylor: these numbers.

711
01:03:56.460 --> 01:04:03.490
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to do a standard scale fit transform on just those columns that are actual numbers.

712
01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:07.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay. this you would do every time.

713
01:04:09.250 --> 01:04:13.969
Anthony Taylor: Then, in this whole process, right here.

714
01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:18.149
Anthony Taylor: We'll probably trim this down quite a bit.

715
01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:21.470
Anthony Taylor: but it it it'll work just the same.

716
01:04:22.110 --> 01:04:31.669
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna get the ticker, create an index with the ticker for those columns. So now we have the standardized data and our tickers.

717
01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:43.150
Anthony Taylor: and we're going to do our get dummies on sector. Let's go up and look again. So we got our ticker here. We're gonna do Sector

718
01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:49.169
Anthony Taylor: Company name does not make sense to do a get dummy. So as we have our ticker. We don't need to do that.

719
01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:50.970
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

720
01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:56.609
Anthony Taylor: it's just it. You wouldn't need to do that. We're basically just going to eliminate it from the initial run

721
01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:59.930
Anthony Taylor: is what it? Well, I assume that's what they're gonna do. That's what I would do.

722
01:05:00.370 --> 01:05:03.850
Anthony Taylor: So we'll do the get dummies, and we're gonna get

723
01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:06.850
Anthony Taylor: all these cool columns by ticker.

724
01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:18.360
Anthony Taylor: Now that we have ticker in both data frames, we can just bring them together into a single data frame. And now we have beautifully

725
01:05:18.690 --> 01:05:20.360
Anthony Taylor: prepped data

726
01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.909
Anthony Taylor: questions on this.

727
01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:27.439
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I think all of that was provided.

728
01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:30.940
Anthony Taylor: Well, now you understand.

729
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:37.970
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so is this the work part where you guys actually started.

730
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:39.599
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I think so.

731
01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:44.709
Anthony Taylor: See, I don't want anybody. Tell me I don't go over the provided code. I did very thoroughly.

732
01:05:45.110 --> 01:05:49.079
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So a means 3

733
01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:51.139
Anthony Taylor: fit. Look at that one

734
01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:55.039
Anthony Taylor: one cell. This is reality right? There.

735
01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:59.549
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this is reality. We would fit it.

736
01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:05.350
Anthony Taylor: We may score it, but keep in mind. Once you score it. That's the development process.

737
01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:07.910
Anthony Taylor: Once you're done developing this.

738
01:06:08.070 --> 01:06:13.329
Anthony Taylor: you're not gonna keep all that stuff that stuff goes away. They're only gonna have like a couple of lines.

739
01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:21.019
Anthony Taylor:  but for right now we're developing. So yeah, we got to build out and

740
01:06:21.070 --> 01:06:22.210
Anthony Taylor: take a look.

741
01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:25.349
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So now we have our clusters

742
01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:28.580
Anthony Taylor: pretty exciting.

743
01:06:29.350 --> 01:06:35.919
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I'm not sure what we're getting out of these clusters because it's just stock data. But we have clustered.

744
01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:42.640
Anthony Taylor: Let's do a quick scatterplot and see what this looks like.

745
01:06:44.730 --> 01:06:46.320
Anthony Taylor: Not very exciting

746
01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:49.570
Anthony Taylor: kind of all over the place.

747
01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:56.119
Anthony Taylor: So let's reduce the number of features to 2. So we're going to do. Pca. We're going to tell it. Just give me 2.

748
01:06:56.660 --> 01:07:00.070
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna fit it and then take a look at our data

749
01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:08.720
Anthony Taylor: and then we'll look at our variance. How did we do? 63 and 19? Or, let's say, 64 and 19.

750
01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:23.770
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. okay, it's not great, not terrible depends depends what we're doing right. This is not life or death stuff. It's stock predictions. Okay, we're just trying to group stocks by, maybe good and bad. We don't know.

751
01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:25.160
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

752
01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:33.789
Anthony Taylor: so we're gonna take that and put it into a data frame. Give it some column names, add our index back to it.

753
01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:38.670
Anthony Taylor: and then we should end up with our index and our new Pca data.

754
01:07:40.110 --> 01:07:40.920
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

755
01:07:42.410 --> 01:07:46.480
Anthony Taylor: now that we have that, let's do the same K-means that we did above.

756
01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:49.379
Anthony Taylor: But now, using our Pca data to train

757
01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:53.540
Anthony Taylor: and then let's output it and see what we get.

758
01:07:53.780 --> 01:08:02.650
Anthony Taylor: Very nice. And last, but not least, let's the clusters look tighter. We can agree to that right?

759
01:08:02.770 --> 01:08:07.550
Anthony Taylor: They look tighter, but we also lost a whole bunch of of detail.

760
01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:19.370
Anthony Taylor: so it may or may not be a good thing?  so what is the impact of using fewer features in this cluster? So well, we can include that using less makes more clearly

761
01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:22.729
Anthony Taylor: 3 clusters. We can agree to that.

762
01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:29.760
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that makes sense less less spread. Okay. alright.

763
01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:33.940
Anthony Taylor: Now. let's look at the weights.

764
01:08:34.270 --> 01:08:38.909
Anthony Taylor: So using the exact same code that we used in the other one.

765
01:08:39.359 --> 01:08:43.890
Anthony Taylor: Alright. The only difference would be the name of the data frame. Okay.

766
01:08:44.050 --> 01:08:50.090
Anthony Taylor: we can pull this out and take a look. This is kind of interesting. So which features

767
01:08:50.490 --> 01:08:53.959
Anthony Taylor: in Pca one or the most important

768
01:08:55.359 --> 01:08:56.460
Raugewitz, Tania: open.

769
01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:03.930
Anthony Taylor: mean, open, mean, Hi, mean, low, mean, close right? All the meetings.

770
01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.670
Anthony Taylor: I mean just straight up. That's it.

771
01:09:07.850 --> 01:09:10.229
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that

772
01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:19.850
Meredith McCanse (she/her): did anybody get an error here where it wouldn't do this because the sizes of the data frame you are calling didn't match the array.

773
01:09:20.130 --> 01:09:35.689
Sihong Zhou: Maybe I think we should use the scaled in code. Did we use that? Does it tell you the shape of your array at the bottom, and then tell you

774
01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:41.520
Dipinto, Matt: that it doesn't match the index? Or is it just say that the shape should be 2 dimensional? And it's not

775
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:58.110
Dipinto, Matt: it says, the shape of past values is 6 and 2, and the indices implied 14 and 2 you did your Pca on a different data frame than that code right there. So you did your Pca on just the 6 numerical values. You didn't do it on the 14 column data frame.

776
01:09:59.850 --> 01:10:05.600
Anthony Taylor: That sounds good. We'll go through it. You can go through and look at the solution. It'll it'll

777
01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:09.289
Anthony Taylor: it'll be clear. Alright. So

778
01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:20.330
Anthony Taylor: this was big. This was a lot. Okay? And then on Pca 2, we see.

779
01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:26.219
Anthony Taylor: got a couple of different variables overall. We got mean value

780
01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:29.500
Anthony Taylor: financials

781
01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:34.009
Anthony Taylor: and information technology, you know, contributed a lot to that.

782
01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:44.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so that's pretty cool. So basically, what we've learned here is that these means are driving these clusters theory. Okay.

783
01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:55.059
Anthony Taylor: so yeah, mean, open, mean, high, mean value. all of that. Alright. So we're going to create a scatterplot, using those 2 most influential

784
01:10:55.960 --> 01:11:03.760
Anthony Taylor: and the clusters are a little clearer. There's not a lot in this light in this cluster, but these are fairly clear.

785
01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:15.279
Anthony Taylor:  so what's the difference between segmentation results of the 2? The it appears that when we do the most influential ones.

786
01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:25.870
Anthony Taylor: okay, plotting, these features yields do not yield similar results, plotting each principal component. Why? Because the principal components are not just

787
01:11:26.170 --> 01:11:27.859
Anthony Taylor: these features.

788
01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:30.670
Anthony Taylor: It's the the

789
01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:35.579
Anthony Taylor: the mother, the I wanted to say, meet both

790
01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:39.830
Anthony Taylor: the blob of all of these guys.

791
01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:41.540
Anthony Taylor: Combination of all of them.

792
01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:48.210
Anthony Taylor: Right? So it's not going to look exactly the same. But cool thing is is, you can pretty clearly see

793
01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:55.960
Anthony Taylor: the differentiations. you know, when we do use the most influential data. Alright.

794
01:11:57.270 --> 01:12:08.010
Mason, Natalie: Yesterday Hafton told me about the rainbow colors on the plot chart, and I just wanted to say, Rainbow is very easy for me to look at.

795
01:12:08.810 --> 01:12:09.960
Mason, Natalie: and it's pretty.

796
01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:13.069
Anthony Taylor: is it called? Just rainbow? Yes.

797
01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:15.770
Anthony Taylor: okay.

798
01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:21.010
Anthony Taylor: In honor of Natalie's statement, we changed its rate.

799
01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:24.340
Anthony Taylor: Okay, captain.

800
01:12:24.690 --> 01:12:26.170
where'd go after

801
01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:27.920
Anthony Taylor: victim?

802
01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:30.600
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

803
01:12:31.230 --> 01:12:38.830
Anthony Taylor:  do we want to go back and look at Meredith real quick? We still have some time. I do want to at least

804
01:12:38.890 --> 01:12:40.700
Anthony Taylor: tell you about your homework.

805
01:12:41.650 --> 01:12:43.690
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, Ronnie.

806
01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:50.569
Masarirambi, Rodney: Oh, just a question. So I noticed that in the code we're getting like

807
01:12:52.030 --> 01:12:57.489
Masarirambi, Rodney: less and less than we have to do in terms of the puller preliminary stuff.

808
01:12:57.790 --> 01:13:00.089
Masarirambi, Rodney: So out in the real world.

809
01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:11.689
Anthony Taylor: that's yeah. This is, that's because we're trying to make it easy for you for the again, for learning real world. You're gonna get that messy, nasty data like we got earlier today and yesterday.

810
01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:17.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And worse way. Worse. The good news is, it's the same step.

811
01:13:19.150 --> 01:13:27.189
Anthony Taylor: Okay. It makes note that the steps are still exactly the same. no matter if it's 150 ugly columns

812
01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:36.460

Anthony Taylor: You'll be okay.

838
01:15:32.530 --> 01:15:35.779
Anthony Taylor: Okay. That's pretty much it has anybody already done it.

Anthony Taylor: yeah, that activity. Just you're gonna do that in the homework.

841
01:15:45.170 --> 01:15:53.890
Anthony Taylor: I will tell you guys, in my opinion. the machine learning homework is relatively simple all the way through.

842
01:15:55.110 --> 01:16:02.790
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and and not just like Anthony, simple like. it's like, literally, we're gonna cover exactly what you have to do with.

843
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.789
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So it's not too bad. We're just read

844
01:16:08.010 --> 01:16:09.570
Anthony Taylor: emphasizing

845
01:16:12.110 --> 01:16:14.009

Anthony Taylor: Okay.

847
01:16:18.610 --> 01:16:19.400
Anthony Taylor: yeah.

848
01:16:19.650 --> 01:16:27.750
Anthony Taylor: So don't really have time to do the review. So let's do it real quick. So basically, let me remind, let me tell you what we're gonna do. It's really straightforward.

849
01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:32.010
Anthony Taylor: We're going to take our open Api open. AI Api.

850
01:16:32.230 --> 01:16:35.080
Anthony Taylor: we're going to create a python

851
01:16:35.730 --> 01:16:44.150
Anthony Taylor: chat. Gpt. that's what we're gonna do. Okay. so you're gonna create it in the notebook.

852
01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:58.119
Anthony Taylor: That's what we're going to do on this review. That's the first step alright. So that's like it's gonna take. I would say, if it takes 20 min I'd be surprised.

853
01:16:59.910 --> 01:17:01.660

Anthony Taylor: and you're gonna get the recording. What am I talking about?

873
