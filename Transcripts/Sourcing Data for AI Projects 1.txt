1
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.750
Anthony Taylor: Get one. Hi, Gamy Derek left, he said. I'm tired of this ice fall

2
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.630
Anthony Taylor: kidding. He's he's probably got something going on.

3
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:25.200
Anthony Taylor: Okay, what are we doing today? Well. we are starting an entirely new module. very excited about it.

4
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.610
Anthony Taylor: Give you an idea. We're going to be talking about Api's, which you know what those are minutes. If you don't.

5
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.890
Anthony Taylor: I'll give you an idea about Apis. II still, some people have been during office hours today. I spent 5 by 8 h

6
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.840
Anthony Taylor: doing Api codes do coding. Apis. Okay,

7
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.299
Anthony Taylor: it's just this is what I do working with Apis. Okay.

8
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.209
it happens a lot.

9
00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:06.920
Anthony Taylor: It's a wonderful skill to have. And it opens a whole lot of data sources that otherwise you would not even be able to get to.

10
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay. is that exciting?

11
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.820
Anthony Taylor: Does somebody actually do? What is that? What?

12
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:27.000
michael mcpherson: What is that? Is that what that is? I chat, gpt, and ask why, it's the good ice. and it actually knew the answer. Of course it does.

13
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.950
Anthony Taylor: It does cool because of the the all of the surface area of the ice. It makes stuff like cold, fast, like.

14
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.379
Anthony Taylor: why would you not use chat? Tbd, but that's what it's good at. Is that kind of stuff?

15
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright, this is why we have AI, this is our future.

16
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:58.419
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. So what are we gonna do today? We're gonna read understand data source term. So this is actually new. It's interesting. I'm glad we cover it. It's gonna talk about licensing.

17
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.730
Anthony Taylor: It's not on the test.

18
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.270
Anthony Taylor: Okay, guys, but it's still good to understand.

19
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.449
Anthony Taylor: Okay, after that, we're gonna actually do some coding. We're going to learn how to scrape

20
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.269
sonja baro: at a website

21
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.510
Anthony Taylor: of its data. Okay, now.

22
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:33.229
Anthony Taylor: we're not gonna go deep into scraping, which is a bummer. Because scraping can be very interesting. Scraping is the only place where I tell you to do stuff, and then you get a little nervous that maybe I'm actually in your computer.

23
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.080
Anthony Taylor: Okay. but I'm not

24
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.010
michael mcpherson: to a

25
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:53.429
Anthony Taylor: well, no, I don't. II pretty sure we don't get deep into scraping, but this kind of scraping is pretty cool. You will be able to get data from websites that have tables on their website, you'll be able to just basically use pandas and read the data in

26
00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:09.490
Anthony Taylor: then we're gonna do get request. So get is an Api or a way we access an Api. We'll know what Api is soon. Api's return. Json data. Json looks like a python dictionary

27
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.980
Anthony Taylor: incredibly similar. You're gonna barely be able to tell the difference. Okay.

28
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:26.259
Anthony Taylor: and then we're gonna learn to convert the Json that we get back from the Api into a data frame, because when it comes to data, everything we do we want in a data frame.

29
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.810
Anthony Taylor: Got it? That's pretty full day. Yeah.

30
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.480
Anthony Taylor: it's really going to be fine. So let's start with data set licensing. So

31
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.960
Anthony Taylor: every time you go out to a website

32
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.040
Anthony Taylor: and you look at

33
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.610
Anthony Taylor: a data set. So I just went to Kaggle. Kaggle is spectacular.

34
00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:05.340
Anthony Taylor: You will learn to love it when you guys are doing projects.  but what you can look for is the license.

35
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:13.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay? This one's other specified in dictionary in the so contain separated.

36
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.570
Anthony Taylor: It's not, though. Where's the license that's so annoying.

37
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.409
Anthony Taylor: Oh, it's not there. This guy just didn't bother to put it in there. But normally

38
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.089
Anthony Taylor: you will see

39
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:35.259
Anthony Taylor: what the license is. So these are the kind of options we might see. Okay, CC, 0, CC, bye, CC, by SA. CC, by Nc.

40
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.929
these are just some. These are created common licenses.

41
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.380
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so

42
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.369
Anthony Taylor: there's there's open source. There's all of these different things don't get those mixed up with this.

43
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:57.310
Anthony Taylor: Okay, open source means that someone has written code and they have made it open to the world to manipulate

44
00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.760
Anthony Taylor: copy. Whatever you want to do, the right thing to do is to cite that person. It's not required.

45
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.739
Anthony Taylor: Okay, because it's open source.

46
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.739
Anthony Taylor: Alright. But python

47
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.870
Anthony Taylor: is open source.

48
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:19.469
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Spark is open source. And these are like the 2 biggest data manipulation languages outside of sequel

49
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.539
Anthony Taylor: in existence.

50
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:29.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so licensing has to do with your ability to use the data that you are reading off the Internet.

51
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.870
Anthony Taylor: So let's just go through these real quick. CC, 0, there's no restrictions period. Do whatever you want.

52
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.640
Anthony Taylor: got it? Use it any way you want want to make money with the data, make money with the data.

53
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:49.499
Anthony Taylor: You wanna manipulate it, change it, make it look totally different. Feel free. resell it if you can go for it.

54
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.569
Anthony Taylor: Okay. cece bye.

55
00:05:53.640 --> 00:06:01.570
Anthony Taylor:  As long as this just means that as long as the person who did create it gets cited.

56
00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.010
Anthony Taylor: So if you use it for something, you have to give credit to the person that wrote.

57
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:14.379
Anthony Taylor: okay, how do they know? Well, if they see their data and you didn't do it? Then you violated the license agreement and you could Sue.

58
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.439
Anthony Taylor: If you're making money off. you're just using it in the classroom project. No one cares.

59
00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.600
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but

60
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.380
Anthony Taylor: be aware. So this one

61
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.909
Anthony Taylor: is. CC, by SA. I've actually I don't see it.

62
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:36.580
Anthony Taylor: There are no restrictions on what user, what you can do as long as the original Creator is credited.

63
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:44.470
Anthony Taylor: and the new work is licensed the same way. So here you can do it, and then license it like this

64
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.899
Anthony Taylor: so you could take their stuff.

65
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:53.739
Anthony Taylor: give them credit. But then your stuff, you license like this, that person doesn't have to get that right, does it make sense?

66
00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:13.860
Anthony Taylor: I can use names if you want. Curry makes some data. He goes. I'm gonna license it with CC, buy. And then Jennifer uses the data, says this was data generated by Curry. Then Matt comes along, copies Jennifer's data decides, and he doesn't care if he gets cited and licenses it to CC. 0.

67
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:20.790
Anthony Taylor: Anyone that uses Matt's copy of the data does not have to do anything for Jennifer or Kurt.

68
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.199
Anthony Taylor: Okay. we're getting into some gray area there, but that is the reality.

69
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.450
Anthony Taylor: Alright. The last one CC, by Nc.

70
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.230
Anthony Taylor: basically, this just says you cannot use it for Kurt Marshall.

71
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.010
Anthony Taylor: Period!

72
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:47.339
Anthony Taylor: And you have to do. You have to credit the owner. Okay. we don't use these at all. but if you see one when you're doing your projects

73
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:58.180
Anthony Taylor: again, it really doesn't matter. You're not making money off of this. Okay, that's the big criteria. If you're trying to make money off of it, and it says, Do not use for commercial use.

74
00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:02.779
Anthony Taylor: You don't. Now. why did we specifically say this? Does anybody

75
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.699
Anthony Taylor: anybody understand why we are calling that out here at Edx?

76
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:19.500
Anthony Taylor: We're making money off this data? All of the data we share with you in class, we're making money.

77
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:28.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So if we did this kind. and and I'll tell you a little little secret before we were edx

78
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.700
Anthony Taylor: couple years ago we were using

79
00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:33.880
Anthony Taylor: real data

80
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:41.030
Anthony Taylor: and and somebody got trouble for it. Then they had to go and redo all the curriculum to get rid of that real date.

81
00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:47.369
Anthony Taylor: So, and it wasn't like anybody was trying to be vindictive about it. It was just it was out on Internet, why can't we use it? Well.

82
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.120
Anthony Taylor: they didn't check the license.

83
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.220
Anthony Taylor: So yeah.

84
00:08:52.580 --> 00:09:00.950
Anthony Taylor: open data. This is another type of licensing. And it's basically the same idea. Open data, common database.

85
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:03.609
Anthony Taylor: You you must credit the author.

86
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:08.280
Anthony Taylor: And you must license it. So this is similar to CC, by.

87
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:11.759
Anthony Taylor: or sorry. This is like CC, by SA.

88
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:18.150
Anthony Taylor:  odc. By any words created must credit the original

89
00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.130
Anthony Taylor: period

90
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:30.040
Anthony Taylor: and public dedication license. No restrictions on new work created using these, and they're considered to be in the public domain. So Pddl is similar to CC, 0,

91
00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.230
Anthony Taylor: okay. pretty exciting.

92
00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:37.810
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Now.

93
00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:48.919
Anthony Taylor: it's funny. It says Instructor Demo. I'm trying to figure out what it is they want me to do in this demo. There's no material, there's no nothing let me check with.

94
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.129
Anthony Taylor: Maybe there's something over here.

95
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.500
Anthony Taylor: We do have an activity for this, believe it or not. but

96
00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.019
every day one day is abundant.

97
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.000
Anthony Taylor: Here's some following points, everything we just talked about.

98
00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:22.269
Anthony Taylor: That's it. Okay.  so finding data sets, I mean, this is something that during the projects, yeah, please.

99
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:29.620
Clayton Graves: And you show us, you know, of any websites that that you can show us

100
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:36.189
Clayton Graves: examples. Yes. Well, we're gonna we're gonna send you the stuff. So you're gonna get to do that. Yes.

101
00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.789
Anthony Taylor: you will see, I promise. I'm looking to see if there's

102
00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:50.440
Anthony Taylor: if they're gonna give me some to show you now, before you go to the activity. So one. Sec. So foundation. So anyway, yeah, during projects, first thing you have to do and

103
00:10:50.520 --> 00:11:01.360
Anthony Taylor: good news is, I'll show you the best way to do this is find data. So you might say, well, wouldn't we want to find the topic first? Well, yeah. But

104
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:06.840
Anthony Taylor: what you're gonna find is there's not always data for every talk that you can freely get.

105
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:11.579
Anthony Taylor: So sometimes it's like, Well, let's go. Let's come up with like 3 topics and go find it.

106
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:24.160
Anthony Taylor: And then, you know, and that's do it. Now the good news is, I'm going to show you. I created a prompt in Chat Tpt. Where we put the requirements of the project into it. And it gives us, like, whole bunch of options for you guys.

107
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.100
Anthony Taylor: and I've been using that for since.

108
00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:41.750
Anthony Taylor: So it'll help you find data. because to me. and I'm gonna tell you why. You know, sometimes people watch these videos and I'm glad they're gonna watch this one right to me finding the data.

109
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.579
Anthony Taylor: It's not what you're hearing about.

110
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:50.909
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's ridiculous. It's like, Oh, well, they gotta spend an entire class trying to find the

111
00:11:51.050 --> 00:12:03.220
Anthony Taylor: doesn't make any sense. When you are working on a job. right? The job has the data. not gonna go and hunt down new data. There are times when you need to hunt down like data to augment.

112
00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:07.009
Anthony Taylor: But that's a different thing.

113
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

114
00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:14.320
Anthony Taylor: okay.

115
00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:25.209
Anthony Taylor: some institutions such as government agencies, they publish data typically that is like the best place to get data. It's usually fairly easy to get.

116
00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:29.540
Anthony Taylor:  it's not always easy to work.

117
00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.610
Anthony Taylor: And I'll give you an example. The

118
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.730
Anthony Taylor: insurance companies.

119
00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:42.359
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And this will. This will surprise you when you hear this is out there, probably.

120
00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.610
Anthony Taylor: but they are required by law

121
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:53.349
Anthony Taylor: to publish every negotiated rate they do with every doctor

122
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:54.800
Anthony Taylor: period.

123
00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:03.360
Anthony Taylor: every ICD. 9, every Cpt. You don't know what those are. That's your diagnosis and your procedures. That's how they bill you.

124
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:13.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Well. the diagnosis is how they decide what procedures are allowed and the procedures is how they do you okay?

125
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.740
Anthony Taylor: And every negotiated rate has to be published

126
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.790
Anthony Taylor: freely and openly.

127
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.500
Anthony Taylor: The format to do that

128
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:31.590
Anthony Taylor: is incredibly complicated.

129
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay, aye.

130
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.710
Anthony Taylor: parse that data out once a year for my organization.

131
00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.540
Anthony Taylor: united health ecbs, and

132
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.099
Anthony Taylor: and it is

133
00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:55.150
Anthony Taylor: about 5 TB of data. But we can see every negotiated rate

134
00:13:55.370 --> 00:14:02.310
Anthony Taylor: for every Npi code. Npi is the national physician identifier. Okay.

135
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:07.770
Anthony Taylor:  and feel free to correct me if I set that number.

136
00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:12.680
Anthony Taylor: but it's it's basically the identifier used to identify a medical something.

137
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:15.329
Anthony Taylor: All right. Not necessarily just a doctor.

138
00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:23.980
Anthony Taylor: And and what negotiator rate they have with that insurance company. So you go. You get your arm put in a cast.

139
00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:28.300
Anthony Taylor: Okay, there's a negotiated rate. There is a a step

140
00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:34.070
Anthony Taylor: price that the insurance company says they will pay that doctor. If he does that tax

141
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:39.229
Anthony Taylor: it's done. It's set. There's none of this crazy. Oh, well, that'll be yeah.

142
00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:45.899
Anthony Taylor: $5,000. Nope. they could. Bill you any damn thing they want. This is what the insurance company.

143
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:49.000
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So anyway.

144
00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:55.770
Anthony Taylor: that exists, it's very, very cool.  the process would be to build that to probably

145
00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:59.310
Anthony Taylor: a good week or 2, and then it took like a month

146
00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.700
Anthony Taylor: to run the data

147
00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.330
Anthony Taylor: to get it all take you brought in.

148
00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.840
Anthony Taylor: It's very helpful for us as an organization.

149
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:12.139
Anthony Taylor: But it's hard to get good news, is it? Only gets updated like once.

150
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:15.590
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. anyway.

151
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:22.820
Anthony Taylor: exciting stuff. What are some other ones? Data. Gov is a great here, let's go there.

152
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:29.650
Anthony Taylor: Data. Gov is a great website. Look at this, 260

153
00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.420
Anthony Taylor: 1,000 data sets are available.

154
00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:47.070
Anthony Taylor: Okay. what kind of stuff? Well, there's all kinds of stuff in here can see recently added data sets. coast-wide reference monitoring system. land change, monitoring, assessment and projection.

155
00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:51.100
Anthony Taylor: These are fun. Let's see, let's find something. Human health

156
00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.509
Anthony Taylor: EPA impaired waters with the of the elder.

157
00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:56.500
Okay.

158
00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:59.130
Anthony Taylor: Super Fund site information.

159
00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:07.729
Anthony Taylor: concentrated animal feeding operations per county. This one's downloadable. You can just download the whole thing.

160
00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:13.940
Anthony Taylor: I know these are not interesting. What do you want? Interesting for? Free from the government

161
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:20.000
Anthony Taylor: map of arsenic concentrations in groundwater? And this is, this sounds like a good

162
00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:26.540
Anthony Taylor: okay. And here you can just download the data and learn how to process it. And you'll be fine.

163
00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.620
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

164
00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:36.120
Anthony Taylor:  that's that. So there's lots of stuff here. All of this

165
00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:38.350
Anthony Taylor: is, look at that.

166
00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:39.770
Anthony Taylor: No license.

167
00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:44.120
Anthony Taylor: It's all data. It's government. We paid for it already.

168
00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:52.069
Anthony Taylor: Okay, there are some data that they, some government data that you have to pay for. But it's fairly rare.

169
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:57.609
Anthony Taylor: You can also do. There's also you can do this for Australia. Singapore.

170
00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.690
Anthony Taylor: Okay, then there's this one.

171
00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:09.320
Anthony Taylor: So there is some stuff you have to be careful with.

172
00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:15.539
Anthony Taylor:  so this is a whole article on what you have to pay attention to.

173
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:33.369
Anthony Taylor: You're in class, and we worry about it. If you're going to use it in an or in a company. Okay? Then you usually will have a legal department that will deal with this for you. Okay, this is never something I do. The only thing I need to know at my job when it comes to stuff like this is that, oh.

174
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:36.939
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna send a note over to legal to make sure this is okay.

175
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.520
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then you set it legal. And in a month or 2 you hear back.

176
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.449
Anthony Taylor: And usually it's, Oh, yeah, that's a

177
00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.979
Anthony Taylor: okay, or don't you dare? That's the other one they love to give.

178
00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:49.970
It's like.

179
00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:52.270
Anthony Taylor: sorry I already be

180
00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:55.519
Anthony Taylor:  We're gonna go to

181
00:17:55.690 --> 00:18:01.060
Anthony Taylor: my my love, the school I've been teaching at data science for the last 4 or 5 years

182
00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:07.849
Anthony Taylor: has one of the best data repositories period and a discussion.

183
00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:10.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay,

184
00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.380
Anthony Taylor: it was, we were one of the best machine learning

185
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:17.749
Anthony Taylor: teaching organizations in country and with lots

186
00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:20.680
Anthony Taylor: of great data. Okay?

187
00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:30.329
Anthony Taylor: And all of it. I mean, you can look at this. It even gives you like. Here's the code. Right? Bring it right into python.

188
00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:32.760
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

189
00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:39.730
Anthony Taylor: But this tells you the metadata. This tells you the tables. Everything you need to know

190
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:40.999
Anthony Taylor: to bring this in.

191
00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:43.690
The licensing on this

192
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:54.440
Anthony Taylor: is there? It is DC. Bye. So this is the this is the one the CC buy.

193
00:18:55.510 --> 00:19:00.079
Anthony Taylor: See if I can get back to the slide show. Where did the slide show? Go, man, there it is.

194
00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:03.719
Anthony Taylor: Is this one.

195
00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

196
00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:17.520
What else we got here. That one you guys are gonna look with. There's another one. And I'm just kind of going through some of these. So you guys actually

197
00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:20.119
Anthony Taylor: kind of to answer Clayton's question.

198
00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:26.590
Anthony Taylor: But these are examples. I think these are in your activity. By the way. but like, here's some AI ready data.

199
00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:34.360
Anthony Taylor:  this one's a little more complicated. But there's lots of data sets here to work on.

200
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:39.370
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And again, you always want to look for the

201
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:52.020
Anthony Taylor: you may now note this one, look at this. this, this one they properly cited. You see this. This is how they properly cite it. Well, look, that's exactly what we were just at

202
00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:54.950
Anthony Taylor: the Uc Irvine step.

203
00:19:55.570 --> 00:20:01.209
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so this data is just data. They pulled from there. But they may have made some changes to it

204
00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.729
Anthony Taylor: long as they properly cite it. They're allowed to do that

205
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:10.599
Anthony Taylor: and see. And this is the licenses, public

206
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:15.569
and spelt wrong, which is kind of weird is how they spell it in other countries.

207
00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.250
Anthony Taylor: LICE, and C.

208
00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:20.320
I don't know.

209
00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.440
Anthony Taylor: Are you guys, are you guys excited about all this stuff.

210
00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:26.790
Okay? Good.

211
00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:36.600
Anthony Taylor: Kaggle is spectacular. Do be aware that they, kaggle is not all public. There are data sets that are licensed there.

212
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:46.330
Anthony Taylor: So you have to be aware of that. Okay, alright. Any questions about why, seeing any of that stuff, we do have a short activity. By short, I'm really shoulder.

213
00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:50.400
Let's see what the instructions are.

214
00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:55.149
Anthony Taylor: So what they want you to do is just go to a couple of these that we just went to.

215
00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:59.830
Anthony Taylor: or some of the other ones, check them out, try to little kite any

216
00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:07.790
Anthony Taylor: licensing or terms of use information and answer the question, Is it a general license for the website?

217
00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:12.039
Anthony Taylor: Or is a license associated to individual data sets

218
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:17.039
Anthony Taylor: all we want you to do. It's gonna take me longer to set up the breakout room.

219
00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So

220
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:28.979
Anthony Taylor: who let's just let's just have a couple people tell me, raise your hand. Tell me about the site you went to, and what license you got.

221
00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:34.140
Masarirambi, Rodney: So go for it, Clayton.

222
00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.310
Anthony Taylor: You're first. God raise your hand right.

223
00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:51.650
Clayton Graves: So I found all the possible combinations for tic tac toe to solve when for X, and it was cited by the Uci. Didn't find license, but it was specifically cited to

224
00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:55.310
Clayton Graves: Uci, and it asks that you cite them

225
00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:05.530
Clayton Graves: when dealing actually say that anywhere but but source was there.

226
00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.280
Clayton Graves: Site was there? That's what you do.

227
00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:16.000
Anthony Taylor: Odds are good. Uci's is probably a web-wide, like everything on their site. CC, by.

228
00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:20.020
But yeah, if you went back to the Uci wind you would see

229
00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:23.669
Anthony Taylor: that's good. That's good, Rodney. What'd you look at? What'd you find?

230
00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:38.950
Masarirambi, Rodney: So we went to a couple of different like national ones. The New Zealand, the one was actually pretty interesting, cause there's a whole lot of like outdoor activity stuff that was like right there, like straight off the bat. It was like walking, hiking and that kind of stuff, and was just like kind of interesting.

231
00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:51.730
Masarirambi, Rodney: We were fearful that we might become those people who start now using a database to find out where we're gonna go. You know, hiking.

232
00:22:52.330 --> 00:23:07.749
Anthony Taylor: there is an app for that. There was one. Somebody made one so that you can use it. You don't need to do that, you? I'll teach you how to do that. That's just so. Brain dead simple. The fact that people are making money on it makes me feel bad for myself.

233
00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.829
Anthony Taylor: because I'm like I could have done that.

234
00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:13.990
Masarirambi, Rodney: Yeah.

235
00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:19.250
Masarirambi, Rodney: But anyway, I'm gonna teach you guys how to do it. So maybe you guys will market right away.

236
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:21.830
Anthony Taylor: You'll be making the money.

237
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:26.750
Masarirambi, Rodney: we'll commons license and do that.

238
00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:31.610
Anthony Taylor: I like it. Well, no, if you're gonna make it happen, is it? Then? No

239
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:33.390
Anthony Taylor: commercial license?

240
00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:37.020
Anthony Taylor: Alright. One more.

241
00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.380
Anthony Taylor: Anybody.

242
00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:45.319
Anthony Taylor: Okay, Gabe, show us what you got.

243
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:49.420
Vasquez, Gabriel: We have found a tribe being data set.

244
00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:54.690
Vasquez, Gabriel: Yeah, like BEAN

245
00:23:55.090 --> 00:24:04.240
Vasquez, Gabriel: got it where they took a bunch of pictures of like a bunch. They took 13,000 different pictures of

246
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:05.940
Vasquez, Gabriel: grains of bean.

247
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:08.080
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

248
00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:11.589
Vasquez, Gabriel: And it was a CC. By license.

249
00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:13.259
Anthony Taylor: There you go.

250
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:19.530
Anthony Taylor: There you go. Some people might be going. Why would I need thousands of pictures of a theme?

251
00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:21.730
Anthony Taylor: There's a good reason.

252
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:27.199
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you're probably looking for something, and they want to be able to identify them using

253
00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:30.540
Anthony Taylor: machine learning. That's why you would do that.

254
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay. alright. Well, that's bad enough.

255
00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:46.100
Anthony Taylor: I think I just closed my slideshow, I did not. Alright. Let's move all so licensing thing really cool. It's fun.

256
00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:54.179
Anthony Taylor: I mean, if so, a lot of times, and this is one of the things I often say.  with our curriculum team.

257
00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.510
Anthony Taylor: And if they're listening, I love you guys.

258
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:10.309
Anthony Taylor: They they tend to give do the lesson plans as if some of you might actually work like in a startup. Okay. I have never met a data student that left this class and worked in a startup.

259
00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:12.989
Anthony Taylor: Not that you couldn't. You absolutely could.

260
00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:19.449
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but typically your skill set is stronger and you don't need to work going to start

261
00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:23.090
Anthony Taylor: so you'll you'll you'll be fine

262
00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:27.700
Anthony Taylor: not. The startups are bad a lot of money to start up if you get in at the right time.

263
00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:30.690
Anthony Taylor: and it's just usually you start off, not making it

264
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:34.140
Anthony Taylor: alright. That's the problem with startups.

265
00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:42.509
Anthony Taylor:  but you know what if you got the time and guts go for it. Alright. So where I did this.

266
00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:46.920
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

267
00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:50.300
Anthony Taylor: Last chance. The questions on licensing

268
00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:58.049
Anthony Taylor: the reason I mentioned the startup thing. Licensing is important. If you're in a startup

269
00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:10.370
Anthony Taylor: and you don't have a legal department, and you're trying to sell something. If you start selling something, and you're using somebody's data and not following license. Your startup will be shut down with.

270
00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:20.849
Anthony Taylor: probably by a lawsuit, and any money you make would be gone. Okay, so that's why this is important if you're working in an organization.

271
00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:24.510
Anthony Taylor: probably not going to run into that, too.

272
00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:27.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so

273
00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:36.240
Anthony Taylor: we're going to pull data from an HTML table. So Panda's library includes a little web scraper. What is web scraping?

274
00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:45.369
Anthony Taylor:  web scraping is basically programmatically taking information off of webpage.

275
00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:54.090
sonja baro: Anthony, we used to call it. We used to call it poor man, or the cheater way of integrating.

276
00:26:55.320 --> 00:27:09.350
Anthony Taylor: Well, it's like a poor man's Api, I suppose that's true. But  for some reason they like to use this one. So like this website. So say, you wanted to

277
00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:11.400
Anthony Taylor: create an app that

278
00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:19.719
Anthony Taylor: looked at hockey data. And you couldn't find hockey data anywhere. So you went to nhl.com. It's actually possible

279
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.420
Anthony Taylor: to come in here with a program with python.

280
00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.729
Anthony Taylor: Open this web page in Python.

281
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.420
Anthony Taylor: Look at the code that's making this page work.

282
00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:37.040
Anthony Taylor: and grab all of the information and off of it, and then present it

283
00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:43.839
Anthony Taylor: any way you like by any way you like as table as another web page. Anything you want.

284
00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:49.360
Anthony Taylor: The the most popular one is we used to actually teach it

285
00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:54.299
Anthony Taylor: was was was scraping reddit. How many of you use? Reddit?

286
00:27:56.380 --> 00:28:00.050
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But it's an interesting site. Okay?

287
00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:02.580
Anthony Taylor:  it's free. Right?

288
00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:04.989
Anthony Taylor: Why is it free?

289
00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:12.019
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Because they get all your data. Well, not just that. There's a there's actually a better reason

290
00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:21.250
Anthony Taylor: with ads all the time. Ad Matt hit it on the head. So if you were scraping their information to your website.

291
00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.450
Anthony Taylor: Is anyone seeing the ads?

292
00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:29.210
Anthony Taylor: No. So they sued.

293
00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:36.820
Anthony Taylor: This went to the Supreme Court. No joke all the way up to the Supreme Court.

294
00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.730
Anthony Taylor: And the Supreme Court ordered

295
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:43.220
Anthony Taylor: that, legally speaking.

296
00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.589
Anthony Taylor: if your site is public, it is public.

297
00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:53.640
Anthony Taylor: and therefore, if I want to scrape your sight. I can scrape.

298
00:28:55.220 --> 00:29:06.290
Anthony Taylor: Okay. They even went as far as today that you have to do it. You have can't, because it's it's very easy. If you're a website owned to make it so it's impossible straight?

299
00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:12.810
Anthony Taylor: But even that they ordered that you can't make it impossible

300
00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:15.630
Anthony Taylor: you could make it difficult.

301
00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:20.090
Anthony Taylor: and Reddit did is almost impossible

302
00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.660
Anthony Taylor: unless you have certain tools to do it.

303
00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:25.040
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but

304
00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:29.130
Anthony Taylor: that's websites out there aren't smart enough or don't know how to stop.

305
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:36.320
Anthony Taylor: So you just could go scrape their stuff or they don't care. Maybe they wet their stuff up that. Why, some of these new sites are behind paywalls.

306
00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:43.340
Anthony Taylor: Well, pay wells hurt. But guess what I can write. We can write a program that'll fire Matt Login and password

307
00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:50.879
Anthony Taylor: won't necessarily hack it. But if you have a login, a password, you log in, you could scrape it. You're breaking licenses there. But

308
00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.750
Anthony Taylor: anyway, yes, Meredith.

309
00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:56.070
Meredith McCanse (she/her): if you scrape a website.

310
00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:11.650
Meredith McCanse (she/her): is that. And so you pull that data into your own website, maybe, is that live meaning, if the original source website changes, do you lose it? Or is it? Just? You take it at 1 point in time, and then you have the data static.

311
00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:14.659
Anthony Taylor: So it's yours. I mean, you could call. You could

312
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:18.610
Anthony Taylor: watch their web. You could ping their website every hour and stuff change.

313
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:22.459
Meredith McCanse (she/her): But you, I think the key there is. You have to do that.

314
00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:31.110
sonja baro: otherwise it won't be reflected if it changes in an hour, and you don't ping it again. You'll not miss that update

315
00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:38.090
Meredith McCanse (she/her): right, but you won't lose it if it if they take it off. Yeah, no.

316
00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:42.259
Anthony Taylor: most people that do Scr, and let me give you a little tidbit.

317
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:49.259
Anthony Taylor: I told you guys who my last client for art. When I was consulted, my last client was right.

318
00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:54.360
Anthony Taylor: These guys. okay.

319
00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:58.350
Anthony Taylor: so guess what these guys hey?

320
00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:03.390
Anthony Taylor: An organization to do about every 5 min of the day

321
00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:12.830
Masarirambi, Rodney: to check their competitors. Prices

322
00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:20.630
Anthony Taylor: absolutely like they they pay in the range of like 1.2 million dollars a year

323
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:25.860
Anthony Taylor: for a program that probably anyone in this room could write

324
00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:37.340
Anthony Taylor: that goes to this website fills in these values, sends back how much they want for a midsize car. And this zip code, or this airport at this time.

325
00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:45.110
Anthony Taylor: and that's I mean it, does it? 24, 7 all day long, hitting this site, hitting this site.

326
00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:49.219
Anthony Taylor: Says the information to Herbs. Guess what they're doing the same thing to hers.

327
00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:56.519
Anthony Taylor: pulling the information back, pulling the information back because they're not gonna openly share. Why would they do that? That'd be stupid.

328
00:31:58.310 --> 00:32:02.170
Anthony Taylor: 1.2 million dollars a year.

329
00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:08.360
Anthony Taylor: That's nuts. And it's a program. Guys. I guarantee you, the people running it.

330
00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:10.520
Anthony Taylor: They're not. They're probably.

331
00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.910
Anthony Taylor: How did you know at work or something?

332
00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:14.650
Anthony Taylor: Just collect the money?

333
00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:17.050
Anthony Taylor: Because it's that simple.

334
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.719
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Anyway.

335
00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:24.150
Anthony Taylor: that's enough. That was way off to the side. But I thought, you guys get a kick out of that.

336
00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.640
Anthony Taylor: Do you guys get a kick out of that

337
00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:37.200
Anthony Taylor: good? So pandas has a very gentle way to scrape websites specifically sites. Well, all sites are HTML,

338
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:40.780
Anthony Taylor: but sites that have HTML cables.

339
00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:42.930
Anthony Taylor: and we'll show you an example.

340
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:48.339
Anthony Taylor:  here, you know what? It's probably easier. Well, there you go.

341
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:50.070
Anthony Taylor: So this is the table

342
00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:56.300
Anthony Taylor: you guys see in the background, in. we can tell

343
00:32:57.870 --> 00:33:03.290
Anthony Taylor: pandas. Go to this. Yeah, URL, and just grab any table on that page.

344
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:11.790
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And it will, and it'll grab more than one if there's more than one. And then, when it's done, we can tell it which table we want and make a data frame out.

345
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:21.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay, once you get it, it almost always requires dropping unnecessary data, renaming column, splitting value.

346
00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:25.989
Anthony Taylor: dropping a necessary column and then resetting index. Maybe

347
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.360
Anthony Taylor: I totally normal.

348
00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:32.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay,

349
00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:38.129
Anthony Taylor: so renaming columns. We've talked about this already. So that's cool.

350
00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:42.420
Anthony Taylor: We'll we'll we'll do this in the code. It'll make more sense.

351
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:52.459
Anthony Taylor: So like these Site population 2 State Territory population 3. We could just say, hey, the index would be 0 1, 2.

352
00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:58.149
Anthony Taylor: Name that city population 0 1, 3. Name, that state slash, third world population.

353
00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:00.770
Anthony Taylor: and then boom! It's done?

354
00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.010
Anthony Taylor: We can drop a column.

355
00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:09.119
Anthony Taylor: That's that. So let's go look! And what this looks like.

356
00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:12.560
Anthony Taylor: A

357
00:34:12.969 --> 00:34:13.819
Anthony Taylor: here we go.

358
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:19.520
Anthony Taylor: So to do this, we need your pandas.

359
00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:24.320
Anthony Taylor: and then we're gonna go here. So let's go look and see what this looks like.

360
00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.879
Anthony Taylor: So here's go away. Here's

361
00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:31.489
Anthony Taylor: the the webpage. We're going to go straight.

362
00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:43.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay. right here. You can see a table. Now if you right click and do inspect. And and I don't know if we're gonna actually teach this in class.

363
00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:46.750
Anthony Taylor: But if you click this little icon right here.

364
00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:48.330
Anthony Taylor: and then

365
00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:53.639
Anthony Taylor: I go in here. you will see

366
00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:57.440
Anthony Taylor: that this is, in fact, a table tag.

367
00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:00.880
Anthony Taylor: You guys see that right there.

368
00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:06.299
Anthony Taylor: So what Panda is doing is looking for a table tag.

369
00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:12.820
Anthony Taylor: and if it finds it it will parse everything in that table into rows.

370
00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:20.529
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's what it's gonna do. Now, there can be more than one table, this one.

371
00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:22.910
Anthony Taylor: I don't think it has more than one table.

372
00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.700
Anthony Taylor: See this? The only thing it might be a table is this one?

373
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:36.379
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, this is also a table.

374
00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:42.349
Anthony Taylor: So when we pull this in, it's gonna pull this in. But it's also gonna pull these little things.

375
00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:46.229
Anthony Taylor: Okay, anything that has a table tag.

376
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:50.419
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So let's go back to our code.

377
00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:56.580
Anthony Taylor: So here, we're going to pass in that. Yeah. URL, and then we're going to read it in.

378
00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:02.539
Anthony Taylor: So it went out to that website and it grabbed this data and looking here

379
00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:06.869
Anthony Taylor: here to go there, it is

380
00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:15.519
Anthony Taylor: that first table. New South Wales, Sydney. 5 million. Okay. New South Wales, Sydney, 5 million.

381
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:22.829
Anthony Taylor: Now this looks a little weird because this slash, remember, this works in python code. It also works in python output.

382
00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.540
Anthony Taylor: So this slash is big. There's more

383
00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:30.729
Anthony Taylor: alright to this one data frame.

384
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:36.300
Anthony Taylor: So there you go. You can see what it returned. Now the thing here.

385
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.240
Anthony Taylor: let's go to a text editor.

386
00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:42.850
Anthony Taylor: Look at this. So here's the first table.

387
00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:51.380
Anthony Taylor: But this has continued, and then look at this. What the heck are all these things?

388
00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.860
Anthony Taylor: These are other tables that are on that web page.

389
00:36:56.050 --> 00:37:02.870
Anthony Taylor: I'll tell you. In the old days. when I used to have to walk uphill both ways, as Clinton pointed out.

390
00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:08.830
Anthony Taylor: we didn't have pool. HTML tags that allowed us to physician

391
00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:12.830
Anthony Taylor: items anywhere we want on a web page. How did we do it?

392
00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.360
Anthony Taylor: Tables?

393
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:21.419
Anthony Taylor: We would create a table on the webpage. And if we wanted something over here, we would put it in that cell.

394
00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:31.320
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's how we did it. We didn't have all the cool capabilities we have today. So old web pages tend to have a lot of tables.

395
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:34.829
Anthony Taylor: But we don't have to worry about that here.

396
00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:41.869
Anthony Taylor: All right. So that's what the data is. So that was more than one table. So when it returns more than one table.

397
00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:46.640
Anthony Taylor: you'll see that all of those tables are actually a list.

398
00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:51.629
Anthony Taylor: so we can actually say, Hey, give me

399
00:37:52.900 --> 00:38:02.299
Anthony Taylor: a table. So it turns out there must be one before this. There's like an empty one before this. I don't know why. Cause see? This? Says one, let's go to 0.

400
00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:09.059
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So 0 is just. And this is probably what I just said, somebody was positioning.

401
00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:13.390
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, like

402
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:21.769
Clayton Graves: looking at that hot mess. How can you tell where one table ends and another begins?

403
00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:24.379
Clayton Graves: It seems kind of confusing.

404
00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:38.479
Anthony Taylor: Bring that eyeball in it. I mean, you could do a lot of things right? You could say like, since now that we know it's a list, everything we've learned about lists are now available, right? Which means we could do a link to find out how many are there.

405
00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:46.770
Anthony Taylor: We could cycle through it, output one at a time, and see what each one looks like.  yeah.

406
00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:51.039
Anthony Taylor: that's that's that's some of your options. In this case

407
00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:58.979
Anthony Taylor: we saw there was one at the top which was not really obvious. But once we, you know, if we would have cycled through it, we would've saw. Oh, well, there's the one I want.

408
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Why don't you have it? You got it.

409
00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:04.710
Anthony Taylor: It's good. I mean, again, we're dealing with

410
00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:07.890
Anthony Taylor: somebody didn't write this code for us to do.

411
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:14.619
Anthony Taylor: We're kind of taking advantage of understanding how the code was written

412
00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.989
Anthony Taylor: to do this. So yes, I'm

413
00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:25.990
sonja baro: I just wanna clarify Clayton. When you said hot mess. I thought you were talking about the

414
00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:33.900
sonja baro: no, the the the website with where you went it almost looked like the HTML with the tags on it.

415
00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.190
sonja baro: Is that what you this one.

416
00:39:36.370 --> 00:40:00.829
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, like, in now, over to the right, like, where? How do you know where one ends? And one begins? Yeah. And it's not easy, like I said, all you could do is either cycle through it, you can, you know, go to the text, editor, and I mean, this is not obvious that this is a table, and

417
00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:03.490
Anthony Taylor: this is a table, and

418
00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:10.249
Anthony Taylor: you know I mean it totally is not I agree with like, it's not simple thing, but good news is

419
00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.669
Anthony Taylor: because we know how to handle a lift.

420
00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:19.459
Anthony Taylor: We can like, do a link, find out how there are. We could just cycle through each one. We can do whatever we need to do.

421
00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:26.389
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. So, looking at this, you can see we've got some column names that are weird.

422
00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:32.009
Anthony Taylor:  and we have. Here's a column, that's all noles.

423
00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:41.149
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So there's some cleanup here. So here we're gonna list the columns. We're gonna this is what I was showing you. In fact, let's let's do this.

424
00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.400
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to

425
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:47.140
Anthony Taylor: comment that out.

426
00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:51.180
Anthony Taylor: So you guys can see. So here's the list of columns.

427
00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:56.339
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we've never done renaming in this manner. But you can't.

428
00:40:56.550 --> 00:41:02.219
Anthony Taylor: So what we're gonna do is we're gonna take the index, 2 column 0 1, 2

429
00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:12.810
Anthony Taylor: and rename and just set it equal to city population. And then 0 1, 2, 3, we're gonna set it equal to State Territory population.

430
00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:15.979
Anthony Taylor: Then we're going to assign

431
00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:18.690
Anthony Taylor: this list. This corrected list

432
00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:23.140
Anthony Taylor: to our columns, and that will rename our columns. Okay.

433
00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.930
Anthony Taylor: that's a little easier than rename up.

434
00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:30.900
Anthony Taylor: And then now you can see they've been renamed.

435
00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:33.410
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

436
00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:42.150
Raugewitz, Tania: can you? Okay? Sorry to be up to. So when you said you, you set it equal to.

437
00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:45.589
Raugewitz, Tania: I know you probably can't go back. But there. So there's a listed name right here.

438
00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:46.510
Raugewitz, Tania: Yeah.

439
00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:49.949
Anthony Taylor: Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, we can.

440
00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.780
Anthony Taylor: Here, let me comment this back out

441
00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:54.320
Anthony Taylor: there you go.

442
00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:59.259
Raugewitz, Tania: And oh, okay. So the equal to is already done.

443
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:07.860
Anthony Taylor: Well, now it is. Yeah, because we already, I mean, we could re pull it in and it'll but but yeah, so you found the index?

444
00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:10.720
Raugewitz, Tania: And then. okay, oh.

445
00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:18.370
Anthony Taylor: so we just found which which column we wanted to be made. And then we set that index in this list

446
00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:25.969
Anthony Taylor: to that name, and then we just assign the list to Dfc columns and boom. It's renamed.

447
00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:27.760
Raugewitz, Tania: Okay, I got thanks

448
00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:29.380
to cool.

449
00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:33.120
Anthony Taylor: It's you could also do the rename method that we learned before.

450
00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:45.220
Anthony Taylor: Right? We do data frame and then dot rename, and then columns equals and then do it in a dictionary. You guys remember that? But yeah, this way, I like this way, I,

451
00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:46.070
Anthony Taylor: so

452
00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:50.840
Anthony Taylor: okay, to drop a column. Can I ask you another question.

453
00:42:51.300 --> 00:43:01.380
Meredith McCanse (she/her): What was the you did? Some kind of shortcut you? You selected all of those rows, and you did one sort of shortcut to put comment. The hashtags in front. How? What was? How did you do that?

454
00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:07.739
Anthony Taylor:  that see that slash?

455
00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:14.740
Anthony Taylor: So what I'm doing is I'm hitting control. I highlight, and you actually don't have to highlight the whole column

456
00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:21.139
Anthony Taylor: or the whole thing and then hit control, slash, and that'll comment everything that it's highlighted

457
00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.770
Anthony Taylor: control. Slash, slash again into an hire

458
00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:26.790
Anthony Taylor: or command slash, I think, on a map.

459
00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:30.590
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Cool. Thank you.

460
00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.100
Anthony Taylor: Isn't that fun?

461
00:43:32.970 --> 00:43:37.680
Anthony Taylor: Alright? So that's been renamed now we're gonna drop the image column.

462
00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:44.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this. We've done this before. Okay. we can reset the index.

463
00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:48.210
Anthony Taylor: I'm not sure. Why

464
00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:49.890
Anthony Taylor: did we delete anything?

465
00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:54.980
Anthony Taylor: I'm not sure why, we're resetting index. But okay, we set the index for 5

466
00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:04.449
Anthony Taylor:  and then here we're gonna get only records where the State and Territory is New South Wales.

467
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.820
Anthony Taylor: So it's just one record. And then we're gonna output it. So this is just a little work flow

468
00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:11.120
Anthony Taylor: that you could do.

469
00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:16.270
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you can go. You find the date of the line, you pull it in, you clean it up.

470
00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:22.260
Anthony Taylor: If you need it for something, you can put it in a database. Put it in the file, do it.

471
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:25.660
Anthony Taylor: It's a pretty cool thing to do.

472
00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:32.199
Anthony Taylor: so most important cause everything after we pulled the data

473
00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:36.340
Anthony Taylor: was just panda stuff that we've been doing for for a week or so. Okay.

474
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:39.150
Anthony Taylor: this is the new stuff right here.

475
00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:41.280
Anthony Taylor: Okay, yeah. Kate.

476
00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:53.800
Vasquez, Gabriel: for the images column. Why didn't the pandas do like a links to the pictures just in case you wanted to go to them?

477
00:44:54.540 --> 00:45:01.859
Anthony Taylor: If you we were doing like regular scraping with beautiful soup. We could totally do it. Did you guys do scraping in yours? Game?

478
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:06.130
Vasquez, Gabriel: No, sadly. Yeah. The data one we do like

479
00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:09.000
Anthony Taylor: a full week of nothing. That's great.

480
00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:14.900
Anthony Taylor: But yeah. So the library, by the way, if anyone's interested, it's called beautiful soup.

481
00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:17.990
Anthony Taylor: and that's how most people

482
00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:25.780
Anthony Taylor: scrape websites. And yeah, if you were using that, you could totally say, you know what. Give me the link for the image

483
00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:32.320
Anthony Taylor: instead of it, just nulling it out. you could get the link. But pandas! Isn't that clever?

484
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:34.729
Pulling? It's good for getting the data.

485
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:40.310
Anthony Taylor:  By the way, I do think data camp as a scraping

486
00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:45.519
Anthony Taylor: course as well. So there, you guys are interested in going deeper. Let me.

487
00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:51.269
Clayton Graves: There are some great books out there about it about scraping with python

488
00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:53.269
Anthony Taylor: if you like paper.

489
00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:57.380
Clayton Graves: I do like paper. Gotcha.

490
00:45:57.390 --> 00:45:59.400
Anthony Taylor: I know you do, sir. It's awesome.

491
00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:01.989
michael mcpherson: Alright, I like

492
00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:03.690
Anthony Taylor: I

493
00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:11.710
Anthony Taylor: okay, alright. Let's see how you guys do. Let's give you a little exercise with this.

494
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:15.309
Anthony Taylor: So you're going to use the read HDMI to do that same thing.

495
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:19.429
Anthony Taylor:  you have a new website somewhere in there.

496
00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:26.900
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you're gonna pull it in. drop in a check. The data types. How do we check data types?

497
00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:31.220
Meredith McCanse (she/her): D type?

498
00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:36.040
Anthony Taylor: Very good. The Gd column requires some cleaning.

499
00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:45.279
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So take a look at that. See what it needs. Remove plus sign. Replace the hyphen. So

500
00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:48.239
Anthony Taylor: this request what? I'll

501
00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:52.049
Anthony Taylor: I'm looking to everybody for this. How would we replace

502
00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:54.930
Anthony Taylor: a character in a column? We have done.

503
00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:07.540
Dipinto, Matt: isn't it? You do the column that you treat it as a string with a dot str, and then run a dot replace on it.

504
00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:09.969
Anthony Taylor: Perfect! There you go!

505
00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:17.139
Anthony Taylor: That was we did do that, believe it or not. We didn't do very much of it, but we did, too.

506
00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:29.529
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And then it asks you to do the loop to convert the following columns to this data type. So basically, it wants you to convert all of these numeric ones to an integer.

507
00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.430
Anthony Taylor: But

508
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:37.009
Anthony Taylor: the reason you have to get rid of this plus minus is because you can't convert that to an integer when there's a plus.

509
00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:40.609
Anthony Taylor: and then you can export Csv. If you want.

510
00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:44.399
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So this is a good exercise.

511
00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:51.540
Anthony Taylor: You guys excited about this one a little bit. Maybe there are some things that you may not remember, but I promise you.

512
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:55.400
Anthony Taylor: They're totally googable. And you have done

513
00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:58.350
Anthony Taylor: okay. Alright.

514
00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:02.839
Clayton Graves: So through every single one. and could not find it

515
00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:17.909
Anthony Taylor: alright. So let me see. 77, II follow. Okay. So let me explain what I did, because once I realized that this was done, that just what this means is they've changed the website since we did this active.

516
00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:23.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Because I can tell you in the solution you're gonna get it says, Use table 74.

517
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:35.979
Dipinto, Matt: I'm telling you I'm mildly agitated about this. I pulled the way back machine up and pulled up this thing from 2021, and it's still the same missing file. So this is such an antiquated. They've just been running this thing

518
00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:40.460
Dipinto, Matt: not functionally for years. I would like to participate.

519
00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:43.600
Anthony Taylor:  So

520
00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:53.770
Anthony Taylor: what you need to learn because this could happen on any website. Okay, is, how could I find it? What's the easiest way to find

521
00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:58.550
Anthony Taylor: alright? Well, we know basically what it looks like. So what I did is, I said, you know what

522
00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:04.029
Anthony Taylor: I mean, and I didn't. I could have got a I could have said I could have got a link of the

523
00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:10.270
Anthony Taylor: the tables list. I probably should. I knew it was somewhere between one and 79.

524
00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:13.240
Anthony Taylor: So what I said is, I said, Loop through

525
00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:16.149
Anthony Taylor: print which one we're on.

526
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:18.270
Anthony Taylor: and then show me the table.

527
00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:29.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now, Vs code is not going to show you that automatically you'll have to go to the text editor. But then you can scroll through. looking more or less for the format you're looking for.

528
00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:45.280
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And say, Well, which one is this? Well, this is table 11. But look at all this other junk here. So maybe I want this. Maybe I don't right. But almost all of these have junk like that is 1718 looks pretty good.

529
00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:55.600
Raugewitz, Tania: Let's go down to the one they said, original. okay, so what you're telling us that the actual table that we were looking for isn't really in

530
00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:59.880
Anthony Taylor: here. No, that's it. I mean, it's just. It's just difficult to find

531
00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:04.619
sonja baro: right? It's really difficult to find. And it's not between 70 and 80.

532
00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:13.970
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I don't think the exact one is in there. I think there's one that's close to it, but it's not the exact. It's not. The exact is the screenshot that shown in the readney file.

533
00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:15.940
Anthony Taylor: That's possible.

534
00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:22.960
Raugewitz, Tania: And so that's like it's it's just such a futile exercise. I mean, it's a set up to fail. Kind of exercise.

535
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:29.080
Clayton Graves: We're not really understanding, sister. Yes, exactly.

536
00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:31.010
Anthony Taylor: I think, Michael.

537
00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:34.420
Gebrekristos, Hafton: I think index number 12 is closer to that

538
00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:36.030
Gebrekristos, Hafton: to what you have.

539
00:50:38.330 --> 00:50:44.500
Raugewitz, Tania: I mean, if it's going to be similar to this table, put similar to this table versus, this is the table you're looking for.

540
00:50:44.730 --> 00:50:52.510
Anthony Taylor: you, you guys are are, I am 100% on board with you on this. What I want to make this into

541
00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:56.189
Anthony Taylor: is, here's what you would do, because this could happen

542
00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:57.820
Anthony Taylor: on the job

543
00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:06.030
Anthony Taylor: right where you're like looking for something, and you can't find it because there's too many. So this is how we would address this.

544
00:51:06.330 --> 00:51:08.200
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

545
00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:13.680
Anthony Taylor: so well, my table 12 is ugly dude.

546
00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:18.490
Anthony Taylor: Afton, is that you don't mean this one

547
00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:24.000
Gebrekristos, Hafton: now? If you go back to your list. the tales list

548
00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:27.560
Anthony Taylor: over here.

549
00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:32.169
Gebrekristos, Hafton: Yeah, if you look at 1, 2, and then it's 12.

550
00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:36.779
Anthony Taylor: Well, that's what I was looking at on on here. This is index 12

551
00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.650
Anthony Taylor: wherever I just have.

552
00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:41.269
Anthony Taylor: But I doing

553
00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:43.269
Gebrekristos, Hafton: that's ugly.

554
00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:49.719
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Well, that's insane. So I mean, we could do 12 here if you wanna look at it. That's what I did

555
00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:53.119
Gebrekristos, Hafton: looks closer to.

556
00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:58.910
Anthony Taylor: I can see the details. Yeah. yeah, see? That's that's weird, too.

557
00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:06.650
Anthony Taylor: So okay, so let's go back to what would we do? Okay, if you run into this situation, you have to know how to find the table

558
00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:15.050
Anthony Taylor: and trying to just manually go through this and find it. You can find stuff that's similar like this.

559
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:16.720
Anthony Taylor: right?

560
00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:19.819
Anthony Taylor: That looks similar. That looks right. But

561
00:52:19.850 --> 00:52:34.150
Anthony Taylor: you have to know which table this is. Why are you gonna figure that out looking? That's why we or that's why I did this little loop here. says I'm gonna loop through the tables. I'm gonna say which index I'm on.

562
00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:35.740
Anthony Taylor: and then

563
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to print the table so that I can go and attempt

564
00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:41.470
Anthony Taylor: defined

565
00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:45.090
Anthony Taylor: the best table. Now I will tell you, even though that one looks good.

566
00:52:45.310 --> 00:52:49.900
Anthony Taylor:  problem with this table. Is this right? Here? This is Jump.

567
00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:51.829
Anthony Taylor: So we all want to deal with that.

568
00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:55.729
This one looks pretty good. 18

569
00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:01.560
Anthony Taylor: 18 looks pretty good. Let's try 18. Yeah, Ron.

570
00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:06.499
Masarirambi, Rodney: so just make sure I understand this correctly

571
00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:16.360
Masarirambi, Rodney: with the way the list was, and say, Try to find the correct table. What we should have done was after we didn't find it was go further down, and

572
00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:25.860
Masarirambi, Rodney: there will be instructions for for doing this or no. No, I'm giving you those instructions. They, this activity is broken. There is no question. This activity is broken.

573
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:33.100
Anthony Taylor: not gonna lie. And if I would have known of a sooner I would have, I would have corrected this before again. But

574
00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:41.720
Anthony Taylor: yeah, I got called in Meredith, and then showed me as like so I left them, came out here and tried to come up way. Make this into a learning experience

575
00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:49.270
Anthony Taylor: alright cause it sucks, and it was broken. But check it out. So, using the method I just showed you.

576
00:53:49.310 --> 00:53:50.980
Anthony Taylor: we found a table

577
00:53:51.790 --> 00:53:55.959
Anthony Taylor: that looks mostly well is that the one in the readme

578
00:53:56.570 --> 00:54:03.570
Anthony Taylor: hold on similar similar.

579
00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:07.160
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, that's well, the data doesn't matter. The data changes.

580
00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:16.870
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So I just ran a query through all of them to find one. That's the final result. And I, there were none that had that. So

581
00:54:17.090 --> 00:54:18.100
Anthony Taylor: yeah.

582
00:54:18.370 --> 00:54:22.070
Derek Rikke: so just go to the website and look for the table.

583
00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:30.760
Anthony Taylor: Well, yeah, that's what I would try that. They're all like this. They're all little tables like this.

584
00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:34.420
Anthony Taylor: right? That the problem with it is on the website. They're all little bitty tables.

585
00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:48.700
Anthony Taylor: So I mean, and honestly, I I'm not gonna show you this. But I could show you how you could take all those little bitty tables. Make them into one big tape. Okay, but you can't do that with just scraping. You have to do other things.

586
00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:54.309
Anthony Taylor: So now that we have that able to run. Yeah, see? Now, we're able

587
00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:55.470
Anthony Taylor: buses.

588
00:54:55.740 --> 00:55:00.420
Anthony Taylor:  should. Yep, you can now clean this up.

589
00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:04.529
Anthony Taylor: So once we found the table, 18 will work.

590
00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:09.189
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Then you're able to run the rest or do the rest of that.

591
00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:25.140
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I have a question. Yes, Meredith Anthony, on the step, were your saving the table to a data frame. What's the difference between? So the syntax that you use here to do? It is different than the class exercise. We just did. What's the difference?

592
00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:41.659
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yeah, the class exercise just said, Df equals tables and then in square brackets, put the index of the table. It didn't use like Pd dot data frame or anything.  or maybe I'm looking at the wrong step. But

593
00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:49.150
Anthony Taylor: yeah, that I was probably just having you look at the table first. Oh. yeah, I don't see where it did that. But

594
00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:58.459
Anthony Taylor: yeah, no, this is the only way you could do it, cause you want to pass one of those tables into a data frame. And we're only passing 18.

595
00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:01.590
Anthony Taylor: In this case. Index 18.

596
00:56:02.110 --> 00:56:11.629
Anthony Taylor: You have to do Pd dot data frame. because each one of these is just an object that we need to put in there.

597
00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:14.640
Anthony Taylor: So yeah.

598
00:56:16.770 --> 00:56:21.470
Anthony Taylor: yeah.

599
00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:30.530
Anthony Taylor: oh, okay, let's go back and look, hold on. Hold.

600
00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:33.630
Meredith McCanse (she/her): It's in self. 5, I think.

601
00:56:34.070 --> 00:56:38.810
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So here we read this into.

602
00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:44.050
Anthony Taylor: No, it's we can slice it.

603
00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:48.860
Anthony Taylor:  Well, alright, let's go back and look and see

604
00:56:50.010 --> 00:56:52.110
Anthony Taylor: if we can do no

605
00:56:54.360 --> 00:57:01.759
Anthony Taylor: Df equals tables. One, I guess each object is a data frame in that, and the one that I just did.

606
00:57:01.790 --> 00:57:08.339
Anthony Taylor: Let's see if that's the case here. Yeah, that worked. I would do. Pd, dot data frame.

607
00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:12.539
Anthony Taylor: Okay, don't not do that, because this is confusing.

608
00:57:13.290 --> 00:57:16.280
Anthony Taylor: In my opinion. Do? Pd, dot data?

609
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:22.090
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, you can do it that way. But it's not always good to take a shortcut.

610
00:57:23.370 --> 00:57:26.339
Anthony Taylor: Prefer you do that all right. Well, Clayton, what's up?

611
00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:36.719
Clayton Graves: So in this exercise we were kind of just looking for anything that sort of fit what the instruction said, but

612
00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:53.859
Clayton Graves: it might make going through that loop like you did. Easier, wouldn't it?

613
00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:58.479
Anthony Taylor: A 100%? So if you were to go

614
00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:03.349
Anthony Taylor: let's talk about what you just said, because you're right. So if you were to go to this website

615
00:58:03.830 --> 00:58:14.349
Anthony Taylor: and you were looking at it. And  you're like looking through this. And you're going okay. I want this table.

616
00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:19.200
Anthony Taylor: Okay, which is the one that was in the picture. Basically, right?

617
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:22.700
Anthony Taylor: So I want this table. So this would be fairly easy to find.

618
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:33.939
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And that's basically what we did. We look for. We found a table that looked like this when moved on the the table in the instructions look like it was a combination of all of this

619
00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:43.250
Anthony Taylor: right? And that's a lot more effort. Then we need to go through for this particular demo.

620
00:58:43.370 --> 00:58:46.720
Anthony Taylor:  yeah.

621
00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:54.750
Anthony Taylor: So so yeah, so normally you would. You wouldn't start at the code. You would start at the webpage.

622
00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:57.509
Anthony Taylor: find what you want to, what you want to get

623
00:58:57.550 --> 00:58:58.810
Anthony Taylor: and then go get it.

624
00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:06.339
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna be honest with you guys. If I had to scrape this particular web page, I would not use pandas to do it.

625
00:59:07.970 --> 00:59:15.260
Anthony Taylor: This would be much better with a more intelligence framework that would just combine all of these tables into a single paper.

626
00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:19.590
Anthony Taylor: But that's okay.

627
00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:25.440
Anthony Taylor: the good news. We made it into a learning experience the bad news I have to write up a ticket.

628
00:59:26.090 --> 00:59:29.720
Anthony Taylor:  but the good news is we made it into.

629
00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:31.620
Anthony Taylor: If you use this.

630
00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:37.770
Anthony Taylor: and with your knowledge of the web page. you can go and get

631
00:59:37.930 --> 00:59:41.550
Anthony Taylor: the you'll find your tapes. I mean, how else would you do it?

632
00:59:41.610 --> 00:59:47.149
Clayton Graves: Will this be corrected in time for us? Forward to be useful to us for the challenge?

633
00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:54.529
Anthony Taylor: Well, I mean the bottom line is, is it? Is? It is corrected. Now.

634
00:59:54.770 --> 01:00:02.520
Anthony Taylor: here's how to do it. Here's the table. All the code works exactly the way it was. It's just not a big giant team. It's a little small table.

635
01:00:03.550 --> 01:00:11.650
Anthony Taylor: right? So you can. Everything is as good as it can get right now. The the instructions is what needs to be correct.

636
01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:19.949
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but but this solution is is, if you want, I can save, in fact, I'll do it. Now.

637
01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:26.439
Anthony Taylor: I will save this solution, so that when I push the solutions up later you'll get this solution

638
01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:28.980
sonja baro: perfect instead of the one that's wrong.

639
01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:34.820
Clayton Graves: I want that data frame.

640
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:37.730
Clayton Graves: Got it, Luke?

641
01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:47.840
sonja baro: Yeah, you got it because we use that to come back re and reinforce what we hear tonight. And then also, when we're working with challenge

642
01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:50.610
sonja baro: 100%. Thank you. My.

643
01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:54.630
Anthony Taylor: you know what like, I said, trying to make it into learning things. So

644
01:00:54.700 --> 01:01:00.770
Anthony Taylor: since we kind of got all caught up and picked the right table. Here's the replace to get rid of that plus and minus.

645
01:01:01.310 --> 01:01:06.670
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So we have the column name dot string dot replace. Just like, Matt said.

646
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:09.010
Anthony Taylor: We're replacing the plus sign

647
01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:11.289
Anthony Taylor: with nothing. And the

648
01:01:12.850 --> 01:01:15.030
Anthony Taylor: this one with the dash.

649
01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.600
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Not sure what.

650
01:01:17.790 --> 01:01:30.800
Anthony Taylor: Oh, that's that's not a dash. That's something else that's like a special character. So we're replacing that with this. And then that gives us this nice clean. all the numbers are integers.

651
01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:33.830
Anthony Taylor: Then we have our columns

652
01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:43.650
Anthony Taylor: list, and we're going to go through and make sure. All of these columns are, in fact, integers. Notice some of them, aren't there? Oh, no, they're all there. Buzz.

653
01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:49.940
Anthony Taylor: Well, index doesn't count. DLDW DLTF GAGD. Points.

654
01:01:50.480 --> 01:02:01.769
Anthony Taylor: So the one we found was a good representative example. It was definitely not the full giant table that they showed. but it looks like that full giant paper doesn't even exist.

655
01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:05.160
Anthony Taylor: So that's that.

656
01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:08.640
Anthony Taylor: And

657
01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:13.659
Anthony Taylor: to you, Mr. Matt, with the Wayback machine, it might not have been this. Yeah, URL.

658
01:02:15.010 --> 01:02:20.219
Anthony Taylor: When they wrote this code they went and they went. Oh, there it is. We do it this yeah, URL instead.

659
01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:21.030
Anthony Taylor: So

660
01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:26.109
Anthony Taylor: unless we go back and look at the git repository to see what the oil used to be.

661
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:28.439
Anthony Taylor: We don't know what they were doing.

662
01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:31.560
Dipinto, Matt: So I try not to be too hard on those guys.

663
01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:36.939
Anthony Taylor: They are doing a lot. But yeah, that one's almost that one's really tucky.

664
01:02:39.730 --> 01:02:43.759
Anthony Taylor: The good news is, we made it into a burning thing

665
01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:45.469
Anthony Taylor: that I'm happy about.

666
01:02:47.530 --> 01:02:49.540
Anthony Taylor: So

667
01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:54.290
Anthony Taylor: we're done with Panda Scrapy. Alright.

668
01:02:56.270 --> 01:02:59.300
Anthony Taylor: I'll make a deal with you guys, cause I feel bad about that.

669
01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:03.290
Anthony Taylor: I will do our first extra review.

670
01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:10.280
Anthony Taylor: Let's say Thursday.

671
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:13.570
Anthony Taylor: and I will teach you how to scrape properly.

672
01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:21.000
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so it is extra material that we do not normally teach you. But I will run you through it

673
01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:25.079
Anthony Taylor:  and and it'll be fast, but it will be recorded.

674
01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:30.960
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so you'll you'll be able to participate. See how we would scrape

675
01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:33.550
Anthony Taylor: other ways that you can scrape

676
01:03:33.690 --> 01:03:35.950
Anthony Taylor: alright just an intro.

677
01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:41.840
Anthony Taylor: If you guys are interested, you can come. If you're not, don't worry about you can watch the video.

678
01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:43.360
But

679
01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:51.640
Anthony Taylor: is anyone interested in that before I even bother putting it together.

680
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:58.160
Anthony Taylor: Alright, alright! Good. Okay. Apis. So

681
01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:14.880
Anthony Taylor: that's a great which I love that the response and content of live data cannot be censored or predicted. So if you hit an Api, and it says something that offends you

682
01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.289
Anthony Taylor: deal with it.

683
01:04:16.610 --> 01:04:24.729
Anthony Taylor: It's not. It's just. That's just the way the Internet works. Okay, we have no control over the Apis. You call

684
01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:30.229
Clayton Graves: if you're surprised and welcome to your first day on the Internet, that's

685
01:04:32.250 --> 01:04:37.169
Anthony Taylor: it's entirely possible. And there is a lot of stuff out there that could return

686
01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:39.279
Anthony Taylor: stuff that may all fit.

687
01:04:39.550 --> 01:04:45.590
Anthony Taylor: Not are anyone's intentions here? Okay, so what is an Api.

688
01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:47.929
Anthony Taylor: what is an Api? Anybody know

689
01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:53.539
Dipinto, Matt: application program interface?

690
01:04:54.240 --> 01:05:01.330
Anthony Taylor: That is what it is. So I have an application. I have data that you what

691
01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:11.099
Anthony Taylor: okay, you want to use my data, you like my data, you like my data, right? So I don't want you directly accessing my data.

692
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:15.030
Anthony Taylor: I want to control how you access my data.

693
01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:20.379
Anthony Taylor: And on top of that I probably want to charge you for accessing my data.

694
01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:26.749
Anthony Taylor: So what do I do? Well, I build an Api. An application interface

695
01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:34.239
Anthony Taylor: to get is so that I can give you the definition. saying, This is how you're going to do it.

696
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:37.990
Anthony Taylor: Here's a security token, if necessary.

697
01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:42.819
Anthony Taylor: And here's what's available. That'll be

698
01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:46.010
Anthony Taylor: $20 every time you make the call.

699
01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:48.959
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Happens all the time

700
01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:50.759
Anthony Taylor: all over the world.

701
01:05:51.310 --> 01:05:57.550
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So that's basically how Api's work good news is. There's lots of free Api

702
01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:10.920
Anthony Taylor:  so application programming interface set of functions. Packets together provide developers. It means communicate with a server and integrating third party stuff. That's way complicated, more complicated than what I just said.

703
01:06:11.290 --> 01:06:13.020
Anthony Taylor: So think of it this way.

704
01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:17.869
Anthony Taylor: Business has data. You want the data.

705
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:25.049
Anthony Taylor: You either a go through whatever rigamarole they ask you to go through to get a token

706
01:06:25.650 --> 01:06:28.799
Anthony Taylor: or B pay them for a token.

707
01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:34.760
Anthony Taylor: or if you're really lucky, it costs nothing, and maybe you don't even need to.

708
01:06:35.550 --> 01:06:39.120
Anthony Taylor: The token is how you identify yourself to

709
01:06:39.350 --> 01:06:41.569
Anthony Taylor: the the person that owns the date.

710
01:06:42.350 --> 01:06:46.269
Anthony Taylor: You ask for it. It comes back to you. That's an Api.

711
01:06:49.100 --> 01:07:04.469
Anthony Taylor: I hope, like I have to look. If you learn how to make them, we're gonna learn how to call them. I know in the data class, we learn how to make them.  it's another thing I could do in an extra review. If we don't, it'll and that lecture takes like 10.

712
01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:10.399
Anthony Taylor: No kidding. Not only will I tell you how to make it. I'll tell you how to make it and host

713
01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.820
Anthony Taylor: in 10 to 15 min. It's that easy.

714
01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:16.130
Anthony Taylor: But

715
01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:19.289
Anthony Taylor: right now we're gonna call them. That's not always easy.

716
01:07:19.930 --> 01:07:24.990
Anthony Taylor: So Apis are developed by companies looking to offer programmatic services and functions to the development community.

717
01:07:25.070 --> 01:07:29.810
Anthony Taylor: I have data. You want my data. I'm going to sell you the data I created Api

718
01:07:30.570 --> 01:07:31.280
Anthony Taylor: easy.

719
01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:35.999
Anthony Taylor: They're used to extract data, play games, connect programs. Absolutely.

720
01:07:36.310 --> 01:07:40.230
Anthony Taylor: Almost everything you do on this device

721
01:07:41.570 --> 01:07:43.090
Anthony Taylor: is calling an Api.

722
01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:46.130
Anthony Taylor: Practically everything you do

723
01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:52.689
Anthony Taylor: is calling an Api. Okay, you do a search calling an Api.

724
01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:58.150
Anthony Taylor: What's it? What's it passing? What's passing? What you put in the search bar

725
01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:09.280
Anthony Taylor: passes it up to Google, Google, right? It looks at it as an Api interface does. The search sends back the results. Your application on your phone parses the results, shows it to you in a pretty

726
01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.120
Anthony Taylor: Api.

727
01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:13.970
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

728
01:08:14.550 --> 01:08:18.000
Anthony Taylor: they work like old school telephone operators.

729
01:08:18.130 --> 01:08:24.599
Anthony Taylor: You asked. It sends back the response hopefully. That response is the one you're hoping for.

730
01:08:25.939 --> 01:08:27.189
Anthony Taylor: That's pretty much it

731
01:08:27.450 --> 01:08:30.259
Anthony Taylor: you can't ask, and nobody's home. That's possible, too.

732
01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:34.799
Anthony Taylor: So you have web apps. They go to an Api gateway.

733
01:08:35.130 --> 01:08:39.769
Anthony Taylor: mobile partners. All of these people can access, not just data.

734
01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:50.279
Anthony Taylor: application services, videos. products. any. Okay. they're pretty amazing.

735
01:08:50.890 --> 01:08:56.649
Anthony Taylor:  the probably

736
01:08:57.479 --> 01:09:07.049
Anthony Taylor: the most important thing to understand about Apis. And this is this is from data, from a data perspective. The most important thing to understand about Apis is that

737
01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:19.859
Anthony Taylor: there are a lot of companies that charge for date. Okay? And Api's the best way to get from a application or an AI perspective. We're gonna use the the whole open. AI.

738
01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:31.169
Anthony Taylor: The reason you are here is because Openai opened an Api so that you could call their Llllm.

739
01:09:32.189 --> 01:09:33.310
Anthony Taylor: And that's it.

740
01:09:34.010 --> 01:09:40.459
Anthony Taylor: If that didn't happen last year. None of you would care about AI.

741
01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:47.909
Anthony Taylor: How many of you cared about AI before you heard about Chat T. Vt. Or any of those? Nope.

742
01:09:48.430 --> 01:09:50.050
Anthony Taylor: Oh, okay, Curry.

743
01:09:51.859 --> 01:09:59.030
Anthony Taylor: But right? I mean, nobody really cared. And there certainly weren't any classes right? So

744
01:09:59.850 --> 01:10:07.190
Anthony Taylor: it was because they created an Api that Api allows you to take a tool like Python

745
01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:15.380
Anthony Taylor: or Javascript. and send in some information, and thousands of servers

746
01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:18.360
Anthony Taylor: execute and send you back a response.

747
01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:22.170
Anthony Taylor: Api. Okay.

748
01:10:22.410 --> 01:10:35.150
Anthony Taylor:  So the client server model you make a request. It sends a response. With the response comes a a number, a 200, good, 404. At 500.

749
01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.119
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna talk about all

750
01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:47.529
Anthony Taylor: client server model web browsers are clients. The Internet is serving mobile devices are clients.

751
01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:56.439
Anthony Taylor: Some of the newer phones like Pixel 8 knows they have servers in them. but most of it is client.

752
01:10:57.490 --> 01:10:59.789
Anthony Taylor: Okay, command line. And

753
01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:04.940
Anthony Taylor: yes, it can be so. All these clients go through the Internet, they go to a server.

754
01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:08.000
Anthony Taylor: Data gets passed back and forth. Whether that be

755
01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:11.670
Anthony Taylor: web pages, Tiktok videos, it doesn't matter

756
01:11:12.210 --> 01:11:21.149
Anthony Taylor: for Apis. We send a request, typically with Json, which looks like a little dictionary that tells the server what it is I want.

757
01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:30.200
Anthony Taylor: The response comes back also in Json like a dictionary and get, and then you have to parse it and make it useful.

758
01:11:31.410 --> 01:11:32.320
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

759
01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:43.400
Anthony Taylor: alright. So what is an Api? I thought we already talked.  yeah, we did. So we're going to make a request. Gonna go to a server. Server is going to respond, Json.

760
01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:45.020
Anthony Taylor: and you get it in your client.

761
01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:48.739
Anthony Taylor: This is what the response will look like

762
01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:54.530
Anthony Taylor: could look like they could look like anything but a notice. Curly bracket

763
01:11:55.050 --> 01:11:56.730
Anthony Taylor: key value

764
01:11:58.060 --> 01:11:58.980
Anthony Taylor: got it.

765
01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:00.809
Anthony Taylor: It's just dictionary

766
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.629
Anthony Taylor: test a dictionary. treat it like a dictionary.

767
01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:08.330
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Hi.

768
01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:15.060
Anthony Taylor: I know we're like going over. Break a little bit, but we'll I'll now send you guys a break.

769
01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:17.020
Anthony Taylor: zoom.

770
01:12:18.450 --> 01:12:19.600
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

771
01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:28.449
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to import requests. If you get module not found, just create a new cell type.

772
01:12:29.210 --> 01:12:31.460
Anthony Taylor: Install requests.

773
01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.239
Anthony Taylor: run, that's up.

774
01:12:33.970 --> 01:12:38.039
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then you can delete it. You don't need to ever do it again.

775
01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:48.610
Anthony Taylor: Alright! So we're going to run this. Here's this, this is our first Api. Now, before I actually do anything with this.

776
01:12:50.970 --> 01:12:52.060
Anthony Taylor: let's

777
01:12:55.130 --> 01:13:00.650
Anthony Taylor: let's take a look at what this does. So this is just a normal website. Okay.

778
01:13:01.090 --> 01:13:04.700
Anthony Taylor: and it's going to create this link.

779
01:13:05.390 --> 01:13:09.190
Anthony Taylor: Let's go to that link. So I want you guys to notice

780
01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:14.870
Anthony Taylor: what this is. So I click that link. Look, it's just a regular website.

781
01:13:15.970 --> 01:13:16.820
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

782
01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:19.150
Anthony Taylor: And I'm getting

783
01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:25.840
Anthony Taylor: dictionaries. First, I'm getting brackets. So technically, it's a Json object is like a list. But

784
01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:34.080
Anthony Taylor: usually there's just one in. So we have a dictionary. Here. then, we have an array. another dictionary.

785
01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:37.829
Anthony Taylor: This key has a dictionary, as it's

786
01:13:38.590 --> 01:13:42.329
Anthony Taylor: value. which is in fact. And so you could do

787
01:13:42.430 --> 01:13:46.760
Anthony Taylor: this key, you'd have to do vindicator bracket Id

788
01:13:47.210 --> 01:13:48.829
Anthony Taylor: to get this value.

789
01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:56.010
Anthony Taylor: Okay, don't worry. We're gonna go through all this. But this is what is sent back to our program.

790
01:13:57.580 --> 01:13:59.999
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we're building this. Yeah. URL,

791
01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:09.029
Anthony Taylor: we're going to do a request. Get so request get is the equivalent of opening your browser and clicking on this. Yeah. URL,

792
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:15.830
Anthony Taylor: okay, so we run that we got a 200, a response, 200 means

793
01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:20.420
Anthony Taylor: thumbs up green light. Okay.

794
01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:31.370
Anthony Taylor: if we wanted to see if you wanted to see what a 400 or 404 looks like. This is a really weird website. All it does is give you a 404. Response.

795
01:14:31.950 --> 01:14:35.280
Anthony Taylor: If you want to see the text of the 4

796
01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:39.819
Anthony Taylor: 404, not found? Has everyone seen a 404 before.

797
01:14:40.110 --> 01:14:45.560
Anthony Taylor: That's when you accidentally back finger your yeah, URL, and you go to a place that doesn't exist.

798
01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:50.959
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you either get a 404, or the. Would you like to buy this domain?

799
01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:54.310
Anthony Taylor: I sure you've all seen that

800
01:14:55.060 --> 01:15:01.740
Anthony Taylor: a 500 is a server error. This typically means that the Apo broke their Api.

801
01:15:02.230 --> 01:15:04.310
Anthony Taylor: Don't worry. They're not going to be mad.

802
01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:12.400
Anthony Taylor: Just means you asked it to do something that it doesn't know what to do so. It returns a 500 and says, and I don't know what you do.

803
01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:18.999
Anthony Taylor: Usually this is a problem either with your request or with the Api itself.

804
01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:22.330
Anthony Taylor: But so those are the different responses.

805
01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:27.070
Anthony Taylor: Go back up here. We're going to redid this request. Let's save the response

806
01:15:27.650 --> 01:15:30.369
Anthony Taylor: to a variable response. Data.

807
01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:34.820
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Now, if we looked at response data.

808
01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:40.749
Anthony Taylor: we would see all it gave us was the code.

809
01:15:41.210 --> 01:15:42.120
Anthony Taylor: However.

810
01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:46.780
Anthony Taylor: if we say, Give us response data, dot content.

811
01:15:48.090 --> 01:15:53.919
Anthony Taylor: We'll see the actual data that's being returned. Now, notice, it's really huge.

812
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:56.550
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but if you call.

813
01:15:58.290 --> 01:15:59.800
Anthony Taylor: it's justice

814
01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:06.260
Anthony Taylor: all flattened out. Now, many of you might have went to this webpage. It didn't look pretty like this, did it?

815
01:16:08.670 --> 01:16:11.800
Anthony Taylor: Did anybody go to this web page? It didn't look pretty, I forgot to tell you.

816
01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:13.519
Anthony Taylor: Well, yeah, that's it.

817
01:16:13.770 --> 01:16:21.120
Anthony Taylor: There is an extension that I use called Json format. It's just a chrome extension.

818
01:16:22.490 --> 01:16:24.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if you don't use it.

819
01:16:27.230 --> 01:16:28.270
It's really a

820
01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:38.909
Anthony Taylor: that's gonna disable it. But anyway, you got a big blob of text. If you didn't use it. If you go and download that extension and install it. It'll look pretty like this

821
01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:48.049
Anthony Taylor: if we're only doing Apis for a week. But I would recommend getting alright. Anyone needs help, install extension. Let me know.

822
01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:57.170
Anthony Taylor: Not now, but later. Okay, where'd my mouse go? There it is.  hi!

823
01:16:57.370 --> 01:17:00.470
Anthony Taylor: So now we can see we have our data. So now.

824
01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:04.080
Anthony Taylor: let's clean this up a little bit and

825
01:17:04.110 --> 01:17:10.690
Anthony Taylor: ask for it in Json format again. If you get the module not found, do a pip install Json.

826
01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:16.299
Anthony Taylor: Once we have that once we have the Json Module installed.

827
01:17:16.670 --> 01:17:18.850
Anthony Taylor: we can ask Python

828
01:17:18.890 --> 01:17:23.100
Anthony Taylor: to dump this Json data that we called it data

829
01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:29.609
Anthony Taylor: and do indents of 4. And what it'll do is effectively

830
01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:37.200
Anthony Taylor: critify our Json. which now, magically, it looks like that.

831
01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:39.750
Anthony Taylor: See how that works.

832
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:46.710
Anthony Taylor: So this allows us to parse, because we all know we're gonna have to parse this right? So if I wanted

833
01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:51.280
Anthony Taylor:  the country value.

834
01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:53.159
Anthony Taylor: So let's go through this real quick

835
01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:56.699
Anthony Taylor: data. That's the name of this whole block

836
01:17:57.430 --> 01:18:03.350
Anthony Taylor: index one. So we can see this is an index in an array.

837
01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:07.490
Anthony Taylor: So this is 0. This is one.

838
01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:15.490
Anthony Taylor: Okay, because there's the comma. So in next one in that list, we want number one.

839
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:21.250
Anthony Taylor: So we have. we're gonna have to go to a text center here. So we have

840
01:18:22.450 --> 01:18:24.610
Anthony Taylor: one. Or here's 0.

841
01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:31.170
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And here's one alright. So we're somewhere in here.

842
01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:35.870
Anthony Taylor: And we want country and then value.

843
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:42.030
Anthony Taylor: So here's country and value. So we're look, we should get United States

844
01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:43.799
Anthony Taylor: alright for that.

845
01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:46.940
Anthony Taylor: And this one we just want value.

846
01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:49.540
Anthony Taylor: And out of the same block.

847
01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:55.290
Anthony Taylor: Which is this big ol number right there. So let's see if that worked

848
01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:57.950
Anthony Taylor: poop. Look at that

849
01:18:59.450 --> 01:19:00.400
Anthony Taylor: alright.

850
01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:09.490
Anthony Taylor: Now, we've done a little bit of this. When we looked at dictionaries, everyone should have some familiarity with this. I know it's a lot more intimidating when it looks like

851
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:10.770
Anthony Taylor: there is

852
01:19:11.230 --> 01:19:15.520
Anthony Taylor: okay. But how would you like yet another cool tool?

853
01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:24.209
Anthony Taylor: This is why I love Mr. Mr. Dude. Go to extensions

854
01:19:24.990 --> 01:19:28.140
Anthony Taylor: and type. Json.

855
01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:30.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

856
01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:37.229
Anthony Taylor: there you go. Actually, it says, I have it. Oh, I know what's wrong.

857
01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:43.850
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So what you would need to do to use Json path you could use Json path status, part or path

858
01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:56.249
Anthony Taylor: is you take the Json that we just looked at. There's that. So go to a text editor. See? This doesn't know it's Json yet. So if I copy this

859
01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:58.230
Anthony Taylor: and throw it into a file

860
01:20:05.820 --> 01:20:14.010
Anthony Taylor: and call it Json text. Jason. and then paste it. Okay. So now let me show you a cool thing with this Json path.

861
01:20:14.370 --> 01:20:17.239
Anthony Taylor: Let's say, I want this

862
01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:20.949
Anthony Taylor: if I click right here. look at what it just did down here

863
01:20:24.290 --> 01:20:28.889
Anthony Taylor: gave me the exact path to that specific key.

864
01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:41.660
Anthony Taylor: Fantastic. I installed this on my work computer, the second I saw it. Because if you work with a lot of Json oh, my God. it's amazing.

865
01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:45.420
Anthony Taylor: Okay. alright.

866
01:20:47.150 --> 01:20:48.610
Anthony Taylor: that exciting stuff.

867
01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:55.570
Anthony Taylor: Sorry! What was that? Tell you what? Again? No, go ahead. There's a couple of them. There's Json at

868
01:20:55.870 --> 01:20:59.580
Anthony Taylor: that one, I think, is Json path status bar or something like that.

869
01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:03.320
Anthony Taylor: it's fairly straightforward.

870
01:21:04.650 --> 01:21:13.320
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so here's what we're gonna do. because I want to make duck done sure the instructions are right on the next exercise, since that was such a ugly disaster.

871
01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:16.850
Anthony Taylor:  We'll take our break now

872
01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:25.069
Anthony Taylor: when you come back we'll do yet. Alright. So come back in day 30.

873
01:21:26.890 --> 01:21:27.930
Anthony Taylor: Thank you.

874
01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:38.950
Anthony Taylor: Welcome back. But he. Hi. so how do we do?

875
01:21:40.450 --> 01:21:41.700
Anthony Taylor: Pretty? Okay.

876
01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:47.630
Anthony Taylor: III did anybody see the value of having like Json Path tools there.

877
01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:54.969
Anthony Taylor: if you've got a lot of experience doing this, you don't need it, but if you don't, they sure are, Andy.

878
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.319
Clayton Graves: I am having trouble interpreting it.

879
01:21:57.910 --> 01:22:03.400
Anthony Taylor: II totally understand. And and we'll talk about that while we go through this. So

880
01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:10.210
Anthony Taylor: I gotta import libraries. Here's all these cool. Anybody get a chance to do anything other than Star Wars.

881
01:22:11.970 --> 01:22:17.039
Anthony Taylor: Star Wars. One always keeps people's attention for quite a while. It's pretty cool.

882
01:22:17.380 --> 01:22:24.669
Anthony Taylor: Alright, so here. We're just going to do a get from the URL. We're looking at the people one.

883
01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:27.669
Anthony Taylor: and it pulled in a bunch of data

884
01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:33.519
Anthony Taylor: here. We're gonna see what it looks like. Oh, we got a response. 200. Yay, look at the content.

885
01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:37.300
And turn it to Json.

886
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:39.950
Anthony Taylor: Now let's just data.

887
01:22:40.270 --> 01:22:47.300
Anthony Taylor: Remember when you're in Vs code. If you wanted to. Just look at that without having to type it, you could go to variables.

888
01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:50.950
Anthony Taylor: and then you can see what it is. Alright.

889
01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:56.269
Anthony Taylor: Just remember you can always do that if you choose, that you want to.

890
01:22:56.700 --> 01:23:03.860
Anthony Taylor:  So here we're going to format it. Make it a little easier to read. So we can see there's 82

891
01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:05.680
Anthony Taylor: people in here.

892
01:23:05.790 --> 01:23:07.920
Anthony Taylor: Okay,

893
01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:12.230
Anthony Taylor: this is interesting. If I wanted to get more

894
01:23:12.510 --> 01:23:23.219
Anthony Taylor: right like cause. There's not 82 in this return. So I could actually come in here and pass this. Yeah. URL in and get the next page of results. That's kind of cool

895
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:26.099
Anthony Taylor: something I have to deal with a lot.

896
01:23:26.370 --> 01:23:32.399
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But if you do the Json file.

897
01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:39.790
Anthony Taylor: so I'm going to create a file gonna call it SW. Dot Json. Okay?

898
01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:50.690
Anthony Taylor: And then I'm going to copy this Json data into it. Wonder if I could? Just you know what hold on.

899
01:23:53.790 --> 01:24:01.840
Anthony Taylor: think I might just be able to tell it. It's Json. Save us a second. huh? Did it work? It did. Okay?

900
01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:06.400
Anthony Taylor: So I wanna do you guys see what I did there at the bottom

901
01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:15.570
Anthony Taylor: before it just said text, and then I clicked it, and then went and found Json and try to lose Json. Now my

902
01:24:15.630 --> 01:24:17.090
Anthony Taylor: Pathfinder will work.

903
01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:24.980
Anthony Taylor: So I wanted the name. So I click here and it says, results 0 name. So let's look at this for a second.

904
01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:29.509
Anthony Taylor: This one does not start with a square bracket.

905
01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:38.899
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's a dictionary object, pure and simple. So we come in here. If we wanted count we could just count

906
01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:44.829
Anthony Taylor: right. But we don't. We want this name. So we go down to results.

907
01:24:44.850 --> 01:24:47.169
Anthony Taylor: Now, this is a square bracket.

908
01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:55.920
Anthony Taylor: so we want the first result and we want name results. There you go. Click

909
01:24:56.280 --> 01:24:58.809
Anthony Taylor: results 0 name.

910
01:24:59.530 --> 01:25:01.750
Anthony Taylor: So when we come back over here.

911
01:25:01.790 --> 01:25:08.870
Anthony Taylor: you can see we have to call the object we call data right here. We called it data, okay.

912
01:25:09.390 --> 01:25:12.409
Anthony Taylor: and then the first key.

913
01:25:12.650 --> 01:25:15.770
Anthony Taylor: the array index and the second key.

914
01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:22.820
Anthony Taylor: And then we could do the same for the birth year. which is right there. So results

915
01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:24.890
Anthony Taylor: 0 birth year.

916
01:25:26.130 --> 01:25:27.310
Anthony Taylor: And there you go.

917
01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:29.930
Anthony Taylor: Yes, Sonia.

918
01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:33.640
sonja baro: So I just wanna check because

919
01:25:33.890 --> 01:25:47.810
sonja baro: when we looked at that, we thought that that the first bracket was was actually the list that would. And so we dropped down and we use index 0. And it worked as well.

920
01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:57.850
Anthony Taylor: You mean, without the results. Or also, we told results.

921
01:25:58.070 --> 01:26:00.539
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, cause it's, oh, are you sure?

922
01:26:00.850 --> 01:26:06.689
Anthony Taylor: Name equals data results. 0 name

923
01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:09.180
Anthony Taylor: right here. Yeah.

924
01:26:09.790 --> 01:26:14.430
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Oh, no. That's what I showed you. And that's what's in the

925
01:26:14.530 --> 01:26:18.390
Anthony Taylor: yeah. If you go down here, you'll I didn't have to use that. So

926
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:25.720
sonja baro: if you go down here, that's you'll see. That's what's there along the top.

927
01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:33.559
Anthony Taylor: It's not as easy to read is this, I definitely prefer this. You can just copy it and then away you go.

928
01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:47.749
Anthony Taylor: But it is there, in the in. It's in the top. If you look at, I don't have it installed, but if you, if you have that one, it has, like little Cookie Cookie Trail, and still say results in 0 the name.

929
01:26:47.830 --> 01:26:50.030
sonja baro: Okay, thank you.

930
01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:53.040
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Anthony, will you show again how you

931
01:26:53.870 --> 01:27:03.779
Anthony Taylor: you put this into the and then you yeah, let's do that. So here you can see the result, and it says it doesn't show you those things. So I went to text editor.

932
01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:10.509
Anthony Taylor: So when I go here down here at the bottom. It says, plain text. you guys see that at the bottom here?

933
01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:12.030
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yeah.

934
01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:16.360
Anthony Taylor: So when you click that you can go to Json

935
01:27:17.330 --> 01:27:20.730
Anthony Taylor: and select it. And now it's a Json form.

936
01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:27.960
Anthony Taylor: You clicked on the plain text word, and then right where it said and yes, so now you can use the

937
01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:31.109
Anthony Taylor: that your, your, your cool little Ada.

938
01:27:32.590 --> 01:27:33.460
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay.

939
01:27:34.690 --> 01:27:37.639
Anthony Taylor: cool. Did you guys have any other question again.

940
01:27:37.780 --> 01:27:38.790
michael mcpherson: do it again.

941
01:27:39.150 --> 01:27:40.359
Anthony Taylor: Sure. Okay.

942
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:43.240
Anthony Taylor: Who's this?

943
01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:50.509
Anthony Taylor: So we we we pulled out the data. Go to text editor. See? Right here in the bottom, it says plain text.

944
01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:55.749
Anthony Taylor: Right? If you click that, you can either type Json

945
01:27:56.150 --> 01:28:04.069
Anthony Taylor: or scroll down to Json and select it, and now that it knows it's Json, it'll let you use your

946
01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:08.370
Anthony Taylor: your extension. So when I click, you can see down here. There's the path.

947
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:12.490
michael mcpherson: Got it? Thanks.

948
01:28:12.770 --> 01:28:18.209
Sihong Zhou: I do not have the pass. I did. You install the extension.

949
01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:20.560
Sihong Zhou: What extension?

950
01:28:20.770 --> 01:28:25.719
Anthony Taylor: Go to extensions and type. Json path. That is bar.

951
01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:31.090
Sihong Zhou: Okay, thank you. And that that's the one you want. I don't like this one.

952
01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:38.520
Anthony Taylor: You can use either one. But I think that this one's better. But that's personal preference

953
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:43.019
Anthony Taylor: that one's so bad, right?

954
01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:47.120
Anthony Taylor: Not really. I mean the dictionary thing.

955
01:28:47.230 --> 01:28:55.170
Anthony Taylor: Honestly, we've all done that before. So it's just refreshing and getting better at it. But that cool little add on will help a lot.

956
01:28:55.600 --> 01:29:03.360
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So another. So it's cool that we can call an Api right? We've learned it. We just did it.

957
01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:07.930
Anthony Taylor: The Star Wars is a database online. Did anybody actually go to the website?

958
01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:12.789
Anthony Taylor: Anybody? Nobody went there.

959
01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:14.839
Anthony Taylor: If you just click it.

960
01:29:17.610 --> 01:29:31.010
Anthony Taylor: it's actually a website. This is what it returns. But you can go to the homepage here. and and it talks about what it is. how it works and what the guy did. It's just a database.

961
01:29:31.170 --> 01:29:37.349
Anthony Taylor: And it's got a cool thing. Okay? And you can even like type. Some requests here play with it

962
01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:39.940
Anthony Taylor: starships request.

963
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:49.299
Anthony Taylor: There you go. pretty cool. Right? Well. you could have done that with any one of these. But let's go look at

964
01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:52.520
Anthony Taylor: in the next one.

965
01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:59.269
Anthony Taylor: I'll just go here. Okay, so

966
01:29:59.410 --> 01:30:00.160
Anthony Taylor: we're

967
01:30:01.410 --> 01:30:04.010
Anthony Taylor: that's the stupid one. Hold on.

968
01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:07.010
Anthony Taylor: you know what. Let me just close all these way easier.

969
01:30:10.090 --> 01:30:20.310
Anthony Taylor: too many open. I can't find where we are. All right. So we're going to do yeah, URL parameters. Alright. So let's just go to this website. Let's see what it looks like.

970
01:30:22.450 --> 01:30:30.920
Anthony Taylor: Well, this was us actually calling, yeah, URL, so let's get rid of that run that. And here we are. So this is actually a really fun. Api.

971
01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:39.819
Anthony Taylor:  basically, you pass numbers api.com. If you just pass in a number, you will get trivia about that number.

972
01:30:41.970 --> 01:30:43.479
Anthony Taylor: whatever number you pass it.

973
01:30:43.950 --> 01:30:49.889
Anthony Taylor: but you can also pass in a number and the the slash map.

974
01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:52.179
Anthony Taylor: and it'll give you

975
01:30:52.710 --> 01:30:54.669
information about that.

976
01:30:54.690 --> 01:30:59.730
Anthony Taylor: Mathematic information about the number. You can pass in a date in this format

977
01:30:59.850 --> 01:31:04.069
Anthony Taylor: month day, and then the word date.

978
01:31:04.150 --> 01:31:06.980
Anthony Taylor: and it'll give you something that happened on that day.

979
01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:09.209
Anthony Taylor: Pretty cool, right?

980
01:31:09.790 --> 01:31:17.579
Anthony Taylor: And it, basically, it just looks like that. Okay, that's actually, I think they even have it in python.

981
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:27.560
Anthony Taylor: Not really. But that's okay, because we have it. So here, you can see

982
01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:37.820
Anthony Taylor: we're passing in this. So let's let me take this off for a second show you what it looks like. So we just did this. This is what we get.

983
01:31:39.650 --> 01:31:41.559
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now.

984
01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:46.739
Anthony Taylor: this is perfectly fine for our uses, because it's basically still a Json. O

985
01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:51.590
Anthony Taylor: I oh, how did that happen? I thought I took that off.

986
01:31:52.050 --> 01:31:53.580
Anthony Taylor: So let's not put that on.

987
01:31:56.700 --> 01:32:06.470
Anthony Taylor: There we go. That's what I expected to see. So this is just text, there's no brackets, there's no formatting. So this we could use. But it would be difficult.

988
01:32:07.170 --> 01:32:12.369
Anthony Taylor: The numbers website gives us the ability to add

989
01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:18.100
Anthony Taylor: another parameter with this question mark.

990
01:32:18.570 --> 01:32:26.730
Anthony Taylor: And when we run that, it actually returns the data so that instructs the Api return the data as adjacent.

991
01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:32.340
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And that's called a query parameter.

992
01:32:32.490 --> 01:32:35.079
Anthony Taylor: They're calling it a yeah URL brand. Okay.

993
01:32:35.810 --> 01:32:38.460
Anthony Taylor: alright. So to put that back.

994
01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:48.709
Anthony Taylor: And we call this, the result comes back in Json format. And we can actually go in.

995
01:32:48.930 --> 01:32:53.750
Anthony Taylor: call the response and say, I just want the text.

996
01:32:54.250 --> 01:32:56.620
Anthony Taylor: And that's what you see right there.

997
01:32:58.520 --> 01:32:59.350
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

998
01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:07.409
Anthony Taylor: So if we want to do it for number 8, same thing, we're just going to pass in a new number. Everything is exactly the same

999
01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:10.440
Anthony Taylor: 8 is the number of furlongs in a mile.

1000
01:33:12.710 --> 01:33:21.219
Anthony Taylor: That's it. Now, if you wanted to do one of the other ones say you wanted to do math per 8, right? Based on what we just saw.

1001
01:33:21.690 --> 01:33:23.250
Anthony Taylor: Whoops. Don't do that.

1002
01:33:23.710 --> 01:33:28.240
Anthony Taylor: Run this cell. And now you get the math

1003
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:32.289
Anthony Taylor: object. If you wanted to do date.

1004
01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:35.770
Anthony Taylor: So say, you wanted to do 6,

1005
01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:38.199
Anthony Taylor: 27

1006
01:33:39.650 --> 01:33:42.329
Anthony Taylor: date. You could do that also.

1007
01:33:46.630 --> 01:33:47.640
Anthony Taylor: Yes, I

1008
01:33:48.410 --> 01:33:56.549
sonja baro: is this because of the makeup of that particular website or.

1009
01:33:56.730 --> 01:34:03.409
sonja baro: okay. So just because they've allowed in their Api send us parameters.

1010
01:34:04.340 --> 01:34:19.589
Anthony Taylor: and we'll respond that way. But somebody another, a Api, may not be set that way will likely will not, unless it specifically states that most Apis will have some kind of documentation. And on that site you saw it was all there at the bottom.

1011
01:34:19.630 --> 01:34:31.420
Anthony Taylor:  but yeah, so so you know the question work. The URL parameters. Sometimes there'll be stuff like format equals Json. Sometimes it'll be actual parameters

1012
01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:44.519
Anthony Taylor: like it could be month equals 6. Day equals 27, and then you wouldn't have them on this side. It would be after that question. But if you guys, I mean, if you look at your web pages

1013
01:34:44.900 --> 01:34:50.830
Anthony Taylor: right like this, one's not a good example. But let's go. let's go here.

1014
01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:54.519
Anthony Taylor: I want you to look at this. Yeah, URL,

1015
01:34:56.010 --> 01:34:59.529
Anthony Taylor: look at that. Look at the question, Mark. You see it.

1016
01:34:59.710 --> 01:35:01.509
Anthony Taylor: Here's the question mark

1017
01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:04.840
Anthony Taylor: in front of it. And then all this stuff

1018
01:35:06.310 --> 01:35:09.379
Anthony Taylor: are considered. Yeah, URL, parameters. There's lots of them

1019
01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:18.960
Anthony Taylor: think there's a few.

1020
01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:29.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So it's a very common thing to see that. As as as a way to pass parameters into your Api.

1021
01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:36.400
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if we get to the point where we learn how to make them, you'll understand a little better. But think of it this way

1022
01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:39.799
Anthony Taylor: again. They just have a big giant database.

1023
01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:43.969
Anthony Taylor: What they're saying is, okay. Whatever they passed here, we're gonna filter by month

1024
01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:47.400
Anthony Taylor: and by day, and they want dates. So we'll send them a date back.

1025
01:35:48.410 --> 01:35:53.460
Anthony Taylor: And because they added this, we'll send it in a Json format done.

1026
01:35:54.730 --> 01:35:58.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay? It's a very fun one to play with.

1027
01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:01.670
Anthony Taylor: Any questions about that bottom line?

1028
01:36:01.730 --> 01:36:08.049
Anthony Taylor: You put a question mark. You can put either a key value pair like value equals something.

1029
01:36:08.340 --> 01:36:13.490
Anthony Taylor: Or it could just be a word. By the way, if you need more than one.

1030
01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:15.730
Anthony Taylor: you do an ampersand.

1031
01:36:17.450 --> 01:36:24.820
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then you can type the next one. Don't put a space or an underscore that doesn't work. Okay?

1032
01:36:26.340 --> 01:36:28.600
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So let's look at

1033
01:36:30.030 --> 01:36:31.820
Anthony Taylor: yeah, there's

1034
01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:33.910
Anthony Taylor: well.

1035
01:36:34.150 --> 01:36:39.490
Anthony Taylor: you know, let's make this and everyone do. Maybe we can get through everything today without killing ourselves.

1036
01:36:40.050 --> 01:36:42.420
Anthony Taylor: So let's just make this into an everyone dude

1037
01:36:44.010 --> 01:36:44.830
I

1038
01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:50.710
Anthony Taylor: everybody open this up

1039
01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:54.250
Anthony Taylor: and let's plow food. It'll be fun.

1040
01:36:56.680 --> 01:37:07.359
Anthony Taylor: So house of requests use the Deka cards Api, to play a game of blackjack with Parker parameterize the deck cards. Api request you arrows order to create deck cards. That sounds like fun. Actually.

1041
01:37:08.190 --> 01:37:12.449
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna prep for the game. So we got a 6 count.

1042
01:37:13.170 --> 01:37:16.439
Anthony Taylor: Thanks. So let's just let's open this up. See what it looks like.

1043
01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:19.660
Anthony Taylor: So we got a deck, Id.

1044
01:37:20.570 --> 01:37:23.500
Anthony Taylor: and is it shuffled. Yeah, hey, that's interesting.

1045
01:37:23.670 --> 01:37:33.970
Anthony Taylor: So execute to create a deck part. So we're going to just do our response. So we need our response data. We'll keep the names similar.

1046
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:37.569
Anthony Taylor: Okay, equals request

1047
01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:43.579
Anthony Taylor: dock. Yet we're going to path them to create that. Yeah. URL,

1048
01:37:44.690 --> 01:37:50.479
Anthony Taylor: okay? And then we can take a look at our response, and all we want to see is if it's a 200,

1049
01:37:50.790 --> 01:37:53.020
Anthony Taylor: and it is so we're good. There

1050
01:37:53.310 --> 01:38:00.950
Anthony Taylor: now, what we need out of this is the deck. Id. I assume this is in the instruction. But so the deck id

1051
01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:18.680
Anthony Taylor: is this value right here? Okay, so this is all. Just one layer. So all we gotta do is say, get id.

1052
01:38:18.690 --> 01:38:20.109
Anthony Taylor: and we're going to get.

1053
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:24.350
Anthony Taylor: oh.

1054
01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:29.720
Anthony Taylor: okay. So we have to assign it something first. So deck id

1055
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:34.599
Anthony Taylor: equals response data.

1056
01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:40.749
Anthony Taylor: bracket, tech id.

1057
01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:47.010
Anthony Taylor: And now we can print it out and we still can't print it out. What did I, Miss

1058
01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:55.450
Anthony Taylor: Deck? Id tech id response data. Chris, that gets. oh.

1059
01:38:55.710 --> 01:39:07.580
Anthony Taylor: okay, why is that not working? What? What did I say? Response data was, we just printed it out a minute ago. It was just 200, right? So we got to convert this to Json. The good news is we can actually do this all in one line.

1060
01:39:08.150 --> 01:39:13.389
Anthony Taylor: We don't have to. Do. You know, we have to do another line to do this. Let's rerun this.

1061
01:39:13.450 --> 01:39:17.810
Anthony Taylor: Now, when we run this, we'll get our deck. Icon. Okay?

1062
01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:20.540
Anthony Taylor: So the interesting thing here

1063
01:39:20.570 --> 01:39:32.469
Anthony Taylor: is the way this works is, you call the De cards Api. You give it the deck id, and you say. draw and tell it how many cards you want.

1064
01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:37.669
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we can run these. This is just going to show us the rl, let's go take a peek.

1065
01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:40.779
Anthony Taylor: And this is what the output will look like.

1066
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:48.120
Anthony Taylor: So you'll see 9 of hearts. There's an image, 8 of clubs. There's an image, and there you go.

1067
01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:54.769
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we have that. So, player, one is going to draw 2 cards.

1068
01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:56.450
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna do

1069
01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:59.689
Anthony Taylor: drawn cards. We'll just call it drawn cards

1070
01:40:01.740 --> 01:40:05.690
Anthony Taylor: equals. And then we're going to call this. Yeah. URL,

1071
01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:09.930
Anthony Taylor: okay, so we're going to say, Request

1072
01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:20.610
Anthony Taylor: die. Yes. And we call this drawcard's URL solution draw cards. Yeah, URL, okay.

1073
01:40:20.970 --> 01:40:25.029
Anthony Taylor:  and then we're going to say.

1074
01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:32.240
Anthony Taylor: select the cards value. So remember. we looked at it. Let's go back and look at it again.

1075
01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:37.260
Anthony Taylor: So to get the value of the car

1076
01:40:39.150 --> 01:40:42.490
Anthony Taylor: right? We're gonna have to go cards.

1077
01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:48.849
Anthony Taylor: And we have and a list here. And there's 2 items in it.

1078
01:40:49.330 --> 01:40:53.370
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we're going to say cards 0.

1079
01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:57.100
Anthony Taylor: And this will give us the first one. I guess we'll just do.

1080
01:40:59.450 --> 01:41:02.409
Anthony Taylor: We can do either code

1081
01:41:02.590 --> 01:41:06.469
Anthony Taylor: or you could do value and suit. You want to separate.

1082
01:41:07.390 --> 01:41:10.319
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then the second card value would suit.

1083
01:41:11.070 --> 01:41:15.760
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so I'm just going to minimize this for now, actually what I would recommend for you guys

1084
01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:19.980
Anthony Taylor: if you do something like this, since they didn't actually add it in, you

1085
01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:28.750
Anthony Taylor: just like throw it in like that. So you can have it to refer to. Okay? So we're gonna say, player one.

1086
01:41:28.910 --> 01:41:44.349
Meredith McCanse (she/her): do you have to when you pull? When you did the get command, alert in the cell before this. Do you have to change it to Json before we do this stuff?

1087
01:41:44.650 --> 01:41:52.319
Anthony Taylor: Love that? Yes, you do. Very, very good. I was waiting for it to fail again. For you guys thought you'd like that.

1088
01:41:52.920 --> 01:42:03.779
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so now we convert Json, this would be the basic output, realize we're running it separately. And the way this Api works it has a deck of car.

1089
01:42:04.090 --> 01:42:06.859
Anthony Taylor: So once you use that card, you can't get it to get.

1090
01:42:07.150 --> 01:42:16.139
Anthony Taylor: Well, that's not true. It's got 6 decks of funds. But it's unlike. Okay. So player, one card one, we're gonna say, equals.

1091
01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:20.500
Anthony Taylor: is that what we call it drawn cards. drawn cards.

1092
01:42:24.790 --> 01:42:26.050
brackets.

1093
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:27.650
Anthony Taylor: cards.

1094
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:36.209
Anthony Taylor: bracket 0. That's the first card  and then value.

1095
01:42:38.450 --> 01:42:42.970
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now we're gonna make this into like a string. So let's do F,

1096
01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:49.789
and then in here we'll do.

1097
01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:54.219
Anthony Taylor: But I'm just gonna copy this. There's no reason to retype it all that silly.

1098
01:42:55.070 --> 01:42:58.899
Anthony Taylor: So paste it in here and change it to

1099
01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:00.790
Anthony Taylor: suit

1100
01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:08.450
Anthony Taylor: right? That's what it says right there. Okay, so that's their first card. Let's just copy the whole thing

1101
01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:12.830
Anthony Taylor: and paste and get their second card.

1102
01:43:14.210 --> 01:43:17.250
Anthony Taylor: and we just gotta change the index to one.

1103
01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:23.159
Anthony Taylor: And there you go. And now, when we run this look.

1104
01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:24.490
Anthony Taylor: I missed something

1105
01:43:25.470 --> 01:43:31.159
Anthony Taylor:  Oh, gotta put a quote at the end.

1106
01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:32.800
Anthony Taylor: Silly.

1107
01:43:35.910 --> 01:43:41.899
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And there you go. 9 of space. We can put a little space in here. Make this a little nicer.

1108
01:43:43.910 --> 01:43:47.979
Anthony Taylor: Funny thing is, they even have an image in here. So technically, you can even pull the image. But

1109
01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:51.299
Anthony Taylor: so there we go. We got 9 space, Jack. Art, that's pretty good.

1110
01:43:52.260 --> 01:44:03.200
Anthony Taylor: So now, since we're playing blackjack, right, we need to decide if we're going to draw another card or not.  so to do that.

1111
01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:06.380
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna take

1112
01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:10.219
Anthony Taylor: this guy.

1113
01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:14.380
Anthony Taylor: copy that, bring it down here

1114
01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:17.190
Anthony Taylor: and

1115
01:44:17.890 --> 01:44:21.410
change the count to one, because we only want one at a time. Right?

1116
01:44:21.650 --> 01:44:28.450
Anthony Taylor: So same deck. Id, but we're only going to pull one car. Okay? And then

1117
01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:31.769
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna do the same thing we did

1118
01:44:32.140 --> 01:44:33.360
Anthony Taylor: here.

1119
01:44:34.410 --> 01:44:36.469
Anthony Taylor: except we're only going to draw one card.

1120
01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:39.950
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

1121
01:44:40.370 --> 01:44:43.630
Anthony Taylor:  and that's it.

1122
01:44:43.710 --> 01:44:48.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So that's drawing a third part. which would be really stupid if you have a jack and a duck.

1123
01:44:49.950 --> 01:44:51.189
Anthony Taylor: Okay, don't do that.

1124
01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:59.569
Anthony Taylor:  Oh, and then it wants us to do basically the same thing again.

1125
01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:02.820
Anthony Taylor: except for this time. We'll just grab this guy

1126
01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:05.640
Anthony Taylor: pace. Now.

1127
01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:08.899
Anthony Taylor: what value? Which one is it going to be? 0? One or 2

1128
01:45:12.650 --> 01:45:13.600
Clayton Graves: 0

1129
01:45:14.230 --> 01:45:22.649
Anthony Taylor: 0? Why, click? Because it's the only thing that's being returned. It's just one card we're just doing. We're doing a whole new call

1130
01:45:23.190 --> 01:45:34.409
Anthony Taylor: right? And you're right. We're only returning one card, so it has to be the only one that's there which would be a 0. Okay, so this will be player one card 3,

1131
01:45:34.710 --> 01:45:39.369
Clayton Graves: and we can run this. Now you need to put that 0. And then bracket.

1132
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:42.679
Anthony Taylor: I'm just surprised growing up.

1133
01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:45.110
Anthony Taylor: sure. Did. Thank you very much.

1134
01:45:46.270 --> 01:45:49.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay. There. Oh, this guy totally busted. Yes.

1135
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:53.720
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Anthony, where did you define drawn cards.

1136
01:45:56.290 --> 01:45:57.280
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay?

1137
01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:03.479
Anthony Taylor: Because we could've called to something else. But I mean, yeah, it's just a variable. So.

1138
01:46:04.020 --> 01:46:10.920
Anthony Taylor: but mostly I just reused everything we did up above, because it's all so which wouldn't make this a great candidate for a function.

1139
01:46:11.110 --> 01:46:12.880
Anthony Taylor: But we won't get into that.

1140
01:46:13.170 --> 01:46:16.010
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So now it says.

1141
01:46:17.090 --> 01:46:22.530
Anthony Taylor:  let's do, player. 2

1142
01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:33.540
Anthony Taylor: player. One points is he busted? Is what he did. We could. We could play with this. We could say, if they did more than 21 they busted. Otherwise they have. you know.

1143
01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:34.990
Whatever.

1144
01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:36.060
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1145
01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:40.539
Anthony Taylor: But let's do. Player 2. Let's do this. This is more interesting to me.

1146
01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:47.910
Anthony Taylor: So let's go here. It's going to be exactly the same thing. except

1147
01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:54.309
Anthony Taylor: don't need that.

1148
01:46:55.260 --> 01:46:58.070
Oh, we need to draw 2 cards, so we need

1149
01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:01.620
Anthony Taylor: this one. Also

1150
01:47:04.980 --> 01:47:12.259
Anthony Taylor: make sure you change that to player 2 card one, I sure will. Thank you, sir. And okay. So first we got making it 2,

1151
01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:15.690
Anthony Taylor: and then here, we're gonna change this to player 2

1152
01:47:16.870 --> 01:47:22.429
Anthony Taylor: player, 2 card, one card 2. That's pretty much all we need right.

1153
01:47:24.100 --> 01:47:27.890
Anthony Taylor: unless we wanna do a third card which we could take this entire block.

1154
01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:31.030
Anthony Taylor: But here.

1155
01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:34.999
Anthony Taylor: because this is already there, the only change is the variable

1156
01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:42.430
Anthony Taylor: to player 2, and this variable is already there, so we'll get rid of that. and there you go.

1157
01:47:43.070 --> 01:47:49.519
Anthony Taylor: So there might follow what I did there. I mostly just recopied everything we did, but we're doing the same thing. We're just changing it to a second player.

1158
01:47:50.130 --> 01:47:54.600
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So they got 6, 8, 4, hey? They got 21,

1159
01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:56.959
only one.

1160
01:47:58.140 --> 01:48:05.519
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now, if we wanted to like, do it, it's manually means they want you just to say it.

1161
01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:09.160
Anthony Taylor: Okay, because this would be complicated

1162
01:48:10.330 --> 01:48:19.350
Anthony Taylor: to come up with, because we'd have to come up with what aces are and what jacks are. So, unless the return actually had

1163
01:48:19.890 --> 01:48:21.210
Anthony Taylor: the value

1164
01:48:21.540 --> 01:48:27.350
Anthony Taylor: the the numeric value. it would be pretty hard to to do that.

1165
01:48:27.390 --> 01:48:35.540
Anthony Taylor: But that's why they're saying manually do it. So this guy is that a used case for using the input

1166
01:48:37.380 --> 01:48:39.849
Anthony Taylor: you could use the input. But again.

1167
01:48:40.060 --> 01:48:43.030
Anthony Taylor: you wouldn't make it this way. But you could.

1168
01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:46.830
Anthony Taylor: You could totally use an input and say, Hey, if they want another card.

1169
01:48:47.140 --> 01:49:08.860
sonja baro: What you know. Are you using the jack as a one, or sorry the ace is a one, or do maybe use it as an 11. Yeah. But but what I'm saying is, you could build it function or a query to the user to say, Hey, tell me how you want to play this

1170
01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:16.639
sonja baro: right? I could, I could make a function just to say by default, I'm gonna give you the best option. But

1171
01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:27.639
Anthony Taylor: so cause like a really crazy blackjack player might go. You know what? I want that to be a one, and I want to double down.

1172
01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:35.230
Anthony Taylor: hey? Double down every. The next part is always a 10. That's the way you win. Yes, sir, Ron.

1173
01:49:36.390 --> 01:49:48.130
Masarirambi, Rodney: sorry. A little bit earlier up above you said that you could have called the image and put that in there. Do you mind just doing that real quick? I'm really we'd have to

1174
01:49:48.170 --> 01:50:01.839
Anthony Taylor: install like different libraries to show you. But if you had an application. If you had an application, that would be something you definitely want to do. Yeah. And there are. There are libraries in python that will let you do that.

1175
01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:12.400
Anthony Taylor: Outside of visual things like map platform live, you can show an image but like there's there's it's I think it's called inter tk, I

1176
01:50:12.830 --> 01:50:13.710
Anthony Taylor: and

1177
01:50:13.890 --> 01:50:18.149
Anthony Taylor: ktr, I think that one as a ui, there's a couple of them that do

1178
01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:24.580
Anthony Taylor: but yeah, we could bring in the URL. We just can't really visualize it without another library.

1179
01:50:24.890 --> 01:50:29.910
Anthony Taylor: But good question. So anyway, that's it. That was the whole thing. Any questions.

1180
01:50:32.870 --> 01:50:33.920
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

1181
01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:38.930
Anthony Taylor:  okay.

1182
01:50:40.570 --> 01:50:45.209
Anthony Taylor: So now I'm feeling a little better because we're still a little behind, but not horrible.

1183
01:50:46.060 --> 01:50:50.550
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So here, all we're gonna do this time we're gonna go and call

1184
01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:53.290
Anthony Taylor:  another.

1185
01:50:54.090 --> 01:50:57.790
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, URL, and it's going to give us some data.

1186
01:50:58.190 --> 01:51:03.370
Anthony Taylor: Let's go. Let's just take a quick look. There you go pretty cool.

1187
01:51:04.540 --> 01:51:09.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so it's got links. It's got description.

1188
01:51:10.250 --> 01:51:13.260
Anthony Taylor: Size covers.

1189
01:51:14.180 --> 01:51:16.439
Anthony Taylor: It's book information. Okay?

1190
01:51:17.170 --> 01:51:24.910
Anthony Taylor:  so here we have an empty list to store responses.

1191
01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:29.830
Anthony Taylor: Now, that may not make a lot of sense right now we'll bear with. So

1192
01:51:31.130 --> 01:51:37.710
Anthony Taylor: we have passed into this print response for for X and range 3

1193
01:51:37.950 --> 01:51:39.030
Anthony Taylor: offset.

1194
01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:46.170
Anthony Taylor: Oh, so when we put a question mark at the end of this.

1195
01:51:46.380 --> 01:51:56.829
Anthony Taylor: It's gonna give us a different. You are out. So let's run this real quick. So it's gonna make 3 requests.

1196
01:51:57.330 --> 01:52:01.099
Anthony Taylor: All right. Let's see how many books we got, 150 books.

1197
01:52:02.050 --> 01:52:04.060
Anthony Taylor: and if we dump this out.

1198
01:52:04.630 --> 01:52:12.389
Anthony Taylor: this is what they look like. So we have joy of fiction, joy of imagination. Blah! Blah! Blah! Right? Let's go to our text. Editor.

1199
01:52:12.590 --> 01:52:14.369
Anthony Taylor: Change it to Json.

1200
01:52:18.450 --> 01:52:25.370
Anthony Taylor:  and we can kind of see, one of the other cool things that you can do with these tools

1201
01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:32.069
Anthony Taylor: is if we want to see. see, we can minimize like the areas.

1202
01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:34.990
Anthony Taylor: So here's the authors

1203
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:37.140
Anthony Taylor: subject type.

1204
01:52:37.880 --> 01:52:43.100
Anthony Taylor: There we go. Here's where it breaks. So subject. So subjects is where it's gonna break.

1205
01:52:43.540 --> 01:52:51.740
Anthony Taylor: And we can go through and get more and more stuff. Once you have these authors, we can make more calls because you saw how the first one

1206
01:52:52.340 --> 01:52:56.350
Anthony Taylor:  first one has this crazy number.

1207
01:52:57.030 --> 01:53:02.070
Anthony Taylor: Okay. we'll look at how the authors are. So if we want to call this author

1208
01:53:02.260 --> 01:53:05.460
Anthony Taylor: or this author, we could call with that number.

1209
01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:07.369
Anthony Taylor: And this, by the way, Guy.

1210
01:53:07.990 --> 01:53:11.579
Anthony Taylor: II have to deal with this all the time, and I'll explain it. We have time.

1211
01:53:11.820 --> 01:53:15.469
Anthony Taylor: So we we got this. We have 150 books. This is what it looks like.

1212
01:53:15.930 --> 01:53:19.870
Anthony Taylor:  So now that we have this

1213
01:53:22.190 --> 01:53:23.240
Anthony Taylor: list.

1214
01:53:24.730 --> 01:53:27.619
Anthony Taylor: and in that list we put

1215
01:53:28.970 --> 01:53:33.590
Anthony Taylor: dictionaries right? Cause. Jason's like a dictionary.

1216
01:53:33.890 --> 01:53:37.739
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we now have what a list of

1217
01:53:38.650 --> 01:53:43.970
Anthony Taylor: dictionary. which means we can use Pd dot data frame

1218
01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:50.890
Anthony Taylor: pass in that list. And we should get a nice data frame. Now, it's not perfect.

1219
01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:52.510
Anthony Taylor: but

1220
01:53:52.670 --> 01:53:56.269
Anthony Taylor: you can see like covers as a whole list of stuff.

1221
01:53:56.580 --> 01:53:59.020
Anthony Taylor: Authors has a list of stuff.

1222
01:53:59.230 --> 01:54:06.580
Anthony Taylor: but it is, in fact, a data frame that you can use, and a zone very, very convenient.

1223
01:54:06.910 --> 01:54:08.389
Anthony Taylor: We could

1224
01:54:08.630 --> 01:54:16.690
Anthony Taylor: go another step and do Json dot normalize. And by doing this, this will get rid of a lot of the junk, but not all.

1225
01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:26.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay. It's supposed to like kind of flatten it out a bit. In fact. yeah, we have 19 columns here.

1226
01:54:27.190 --> 01:54:43.879
Anthony Taylor: And here we have 23. Okay, so it flattened out like 4 of them. which is okay. And then if you wanted to save it to a file, you okay? Or you could. If this, if you had a database, you could write it to a database or something like that.

1227
01:54:44.740 --> 01:54:48.430
Anthony Taylor: So the moral of that story is

1228
01:54:48.900 --> 01:54:58.870
Anthony Taylor:  you can, if you have an Api that has like a new rick thing or something like that so that you could like Page

1229
01:54:59.060 --> 01:55:01.620
Anthony Taylor: or look for stuff.

1230
01:55:01.730 --> 01:55:07.360
Anthony Taylor: Okay, with numbers, you can do something like this and just cycle through, make multiple calls.

1231
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:09.230
Anthony Taylor: So

1232
01:55:16.850 --> 01:55:24.519
Anthony Taylor: alright. Let's do this one, too, as an everyone do just real quick. I do have an example. I wanted to explain to you, but I don't want to

1233
01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:30.070
Anthony Taylor: go way over. So let's let's do this one.

1234
01:55:31.270 --> 01:55:33.820
Anthony Taylor: And if we have time after.

1235
01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:38.069
Anthony Taylor: we'll talk about examples, I have.

1236
01:55:40.030 --> 01:55:40.920
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1237
01:55:41.050 --> 01:55:43.770
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna start with this guy here.

1238
01:55:48.540 --> 01:55:54.399
Anthony Taylor: and it's gonna re import pandas and all of that, it's cool. They gave us this nice list.

1239
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:59.819
Anthony Taylor: So in this particular case. the URL to call.

1240
01:56:00.010 --> 01:56:06.449
Anthony Taylor: Is this one here? But then it has this question. Mark, remember how I told you. Sometimes they have, like a

1241
01:56:06.470 --> 01:56:08.139
Anthony Taylor: Q equals, or

1242
01:56:08.330 --> 01:56:13.730
Anthony Taylor: you know, whatever equals. Well, this is an example of that. Q equals

1243
01:56:14.490 --> 01:56:17.390
Anthony Taylor: requires the name of a TV show.

1244
01:56:19.110 --> 01:56:20.709
Anthony Taylor: So if we put

1245
01:56:20.770 --> 01:56:25.480
Anthony Taylor: altered carbon, this URL. Will return.

1246
01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:27.460
Anthony Taylor: Jason.

1247
01:56:28.090 --> 01:56:30.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so

1248
01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:36.490
Anthony Taylor: let's create a couple lists for titles.

1249
01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:41.959
Anthony Taylor: Will it return the Json automatically, or will you have to specify that?

1250
01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:49.999
Anthony Taylor: Well, the way we would find that out is, that's a and that's a fantastic question. And it is appropriate.

1251
01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:57.510
Anthony Taylor: Would be to go to this. Yeah, URL or to the Api itself.

1252
01:56:57.690 --> 01:57:04.239
Anthony Taylor: and we would have to look at the documentation to find out what it turns. But see here, you can see

1253
01:57:04.420 --> 01:57:10.310
Anthony Taylor: pretty straightforward. It gives you an example. Cool thing is that examples return in Json.

1254
01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:16.619
Anthony Taylor: We could read the documentation or safely assume it's going to return. Json, because it did.

1255
01:57:16.950 --> 01:57:17.790
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1256
01:57:18.010 --> 01:57:21.149
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, all all Api Pip document.

1257
01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:25.970
Anthony Taylor: if they don't. you probably don't want to use them anymore. Okay.

1258
01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:34.639
Anthony Taylor: so since we're going to, obviously what we're going to do here is we're going to go through each one of these, call them and save it to a data frame.

1259
01:57:35.330 --> 01:57:41.030
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we need these lists to hold the results.

1260
01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:53.400
Anthony Taylor: And now we're gonna loop through it. So we're gonna say for show in TV shows. we've all done this.

1261
01:57:53.610 --> 01:58:07.380
Anthony Taylor: And then we're gonna say, target, yeah. URL, so this will be, we're gonna we're gonna format the yeah. URL, okay? So we can say, f curly brackets, base. URL.

1262
01:58:07.420 --> 01:58:12.039
Anthony Taylor: And what we want to do is basically just add to the end of it whatever show is

1263
01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:27.369
Anthony Taylor: okay. So the first one will be this URL plus altered cardboard. Okay, so once we have that we can do our requests. Should that be show or TV shows.

1264
01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:34.240
Anthony Taylor: remember, TV shows is the name of the list show will be each item in the list

1265
01:58:34.270 --> 01:58:35.670
Anthony Taylor: as we loop through.

1266
01:58:36.100 --> 01:58:40.449
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So response, we're gonna do our get so requests

1267
01:58:40.610 --> 01:58:45.719
Anthony Taylor: not yet. And we're going to pass in our URL

1268
01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:52.670
Anthony Taylor: target, URL. And then remember, we need to tell it. It's Json.

1269
01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:58.389
Anthony Taylor: okay, so that we can parse now that we have that we can do

1270
01:58:58.540 --> 01:59:03.489
Anthony Taylor: titles append. Let's go back and look at that. That example.

1271
01:59:07.310 --> 01:59:09.530
Anthony Taylor: So where is title?

1272
01:59:10.630 --> 01:59:15.010
Anthony Taylor: It's name. So we're gonna come in. It's 0

1273
01:59:15.050 --> 01:59:19.690
Anthony Taylor: brackets. So 0 bracket show name.

1274
01:59:20.430 --> 01:59:22.409
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I'm good with that.

1275
01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:32.130
Anthony Taylor: So we're going to do titles. Append response. because that's what we called our response bracket, 0

1276
01:59:32.650 --> 01:59:34.730
Anthony Taylor: bracket show

1277
01:59:37.670 --> 01:59:39.359
Anthony Taylor: bracket name.

1278
01:59:40.710 --> 01:59:44.800
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So that gave us our title. And we're gonna put that in that list.

1279
01:59:44.960 --> 01:59:48.199
Anthony Taylor: Next, we want the

1280
01:59:48.630 --> 01:59:51.790
Anthony Taylor: rating. Let's go look at our example.

1281
01:59:53.330 --> 01:59:59.130
Anthony Taylor: Rating is way down there. That right? Or is there another one?

1282
02:00:00.250 --> 02:00:03.340
Anthony Taylor: So rating?

1283
02:00:04.220 --> 02:00:08.790
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so to get there, we need to do 0

1284
02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:15.749
Anthony Taylor: show rating average. Everybody see that?

1285
02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:18.800
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1286
02:00:19.230 --> 02:00:26.359
Anthony Taylor: okay, okay, okay. so to get there, we're gonna say, ratings of pen, because we want to put it in our list

1287
02:00:26.990 --> 02:00:35.600
Anthony Taylor: response brackets, 0 bracket show in quotes.

1288
02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:40.470
Anthony Taylor:  bracket ratings

1289
02:00:42.460 --> 02:00:43.630
Anthony Taylor: and

1290
02:00:43.780 --> 02:00:45.660
Anthony Taylor: bracket average.

1291
02:00:46.790 --> 02:00:50.440
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And so that'll append it to there.

1292
02:00:51.500 --> 02:00:59.069
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then, last, but not least, we're gonna put in all results. We're just gonna put the whole thing in. So we're gonna say, all results

1293
02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:03.880
Anthony Taylor: data pans response 0.

1294
02:01:05.410 --> 02:01:08.390
Anthony Taylor: And that's it. Well, we'll put show. Just

1295
02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:13.900
Anthony Taylor: so. It's not totally messy. Okay? So now we can loop through this.

1296
02:01:15.180 --> 02:01:18.819
Anthony Taylor: And if it, why is it ratings?

1297
02:01:19.150 --> 02:01:30.289
Anthony Taylor: I think ratings doesn't have an S on it. I think it's just the word rating. I'm guessing you're right. Let's do a quick peek. Make sure. Yep, look at that ratings, not ratings

1298
02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:34.310
Anthony Taylor: that makes sense. Let's fix that. So that's what you're gonna get.

1299
02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:37.640
Anthony Taylor: If you put a key in that doesn't exist.

1300
02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:43.510
Anthony Taylor: And there we go. So now, what? It's literally

1301
02:01:44.210 --> 02:01:53.240
Anthony Taylor: making an Api call for every one of those names. Okay? So now we can create a data frame because we have all those lists.

1302
02:01:53.570 --> 02:01:57.390
Anthony Taylor: So we can say, shows

1303
02:01:57.590 --> 02:02:01.349
Anthony Taylor: df, equals. And here we'll just do Pd, dot data frame.

1304
02:02:02.330 --> 02:02:05.979
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And in here we're just gonna pass in

1305
02:02:06.150 --> 02:02:07.520
Anthony Taylor: this time

1306
02:02:08.650 --> 02:02:16.560
Anthony Taylor: dictionary of lists. right? Because we just made a bunch of lists.

1307
02:02:16.570 --> 02:02:20.139
Anthony Taylor: So now we can pass in here the title

1308
02:02:20.700 --> 02:02:24.229
Anthony Taylor: Colon and our titles

1309
02:02:24.670 --> 02:02:29.830
Anthony Taylor: lists that we made. and here we can pass some rating

1310
02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.640
Anthony Taylor: and pass in our ratings

1311
02:02:34.420 --> 02:02:38.899
Anthony Taylor: list that we made. and then that will give us

1312
02:02:43.370 --> 02:02:44.940
Anthony Taylor: chose. Df.

1313
02:02:46.150 --> 02:02:47.569
Anthony Taylor: that will give us that.

1314
02:02:47.980 --> 02:02:53.960
Anthony Taylor: That's pretty cool. This didn't exist a few seconds ago. We pulled this down from an Api.

1315
02:02:54.820 --> 02:03:06.629
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then the last thing it wants us to do is try to use Json normalize on the all results to see what that will look like. So we'll do all results.

1316
02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:09.970
Anthony Taylor: Underscore df.

1317
02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:15.759
Anthony Taylor: equals. And then we're just going to Pd, dot Json, normalize

1318
02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:18.840
Anthony Taylor: all underscore results

1319
02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:22.980
Anthony Taylor: and we'll show what it looks like

1320
02:03:24.910 --> 02:03:26.170
Anthony Taylor: and

1321
02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:28.480
Anthony Taylor: what's up.

1322
02:03:28.910 --> 02:03:32.640
Anthony Taylor: That's pretty cool that it flattened it all out. That is.

1323
02:03:33.090 --> 02:03:44.469
Anthony Taylor: have to tell you guys, that's way cool cause flattening it out like that really stinks when you have to do that, and you will have to do that if you work with this stuff very much

1324
02:03:44.750 --> 02:03:51.550
Anthony Taylor: and then if we just want to send this to do a Csv file. We can just do all that you have to.

1325
02:03:51.670 --> 02:03:55.200
Anthony Taylor: Csv. Now that the name

1326
02:03:56.270 --> 02:03:58.040
Anthony Taylor: of the Csv file

1327
02:04:02.770 --> 02:04:06.410
Anthony Taylor: and if you want the index or not. You can put that in there, too.

1328
02:04:10.230 --> 02:04:12.400
Anthony Taylor: and there you go, and then, voila!

1329
02:04:12.580 --> 02:04:13.719
Anthony Taylor: You have the file.

1330
02:04:16.110 --> 02:04:19.889
Meredith McCanse (she/her): You show the step that you normalize one more time.

1331
02:04:20.070 --> 02:04:22.060
Anthony Taylor: Yes'm right there.

1332
02:04:25.420 --> 02:04:26.739
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay, thank you.

1333
02:04:27.140 --> 02:04:28.229
Anthony Taylor: Not a problem.

1334
02:04:29.070 --> 02:04:33.779
Anthony Taylor: Alright ken. So real quick. Just a quick note on

1335
02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:40.750
Anthony Taylor: the card. One hard one actually had a really cool

1336
02:04:41.450 --> 02:04:45.299
Anthony Taylor:  example in it

1337
02:04:46.480 --> 02:04:50.110
Anthony Taylor: that I wanted to talk about very quickly. I know it's time to go, but

1338
02:04:50.190 --> 02:04:52.319
Anthony Taylor: wherever the cardin I don't know.

1339
02:04:52.770 --> 02:05:00.330
Anthony Taylor: It's in here somewhere there. It is so very often these Apis require you to get authenticated.

1340
02:05:01.230 --> 02:05:10.149
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And the way they do that is, you'll get a token or a client, id, basically a login and a password. You will make a call

1341
02:05:10.600 --> 02:05:16.980
Anthony Taylor: to a specific Api with that credential information.

1342
02:05:17.130 --> 02:05:21.310
Anthony Taylor: and it will return a value

1343
02:05:21.330 --> 02:05:25.890
Anthony Taylor: that you then have to include in every call you want to make.

1344
02:05:27.730 --> 02:05:30.799
Anthony Taylor: And that value is basically your session key.

1345
02:05:31.030 --> 02:05:37.879
Anthony Taylor: So you make the call. You get credentials. Get this value, and then you're going to call it out just like we did here.

1346
02:05:38.530 --> 02:05:39.430
Anthony Taylor: right?

1347
02:05:39.610 --> 02:05:42.720
Anthony Taylor: And then we used it in our stuff later.

1348
02:05:43.550 --> 02:05:49.610
Anthony Taylor: So this is how authentication in more advanced Apis actually work.

1349
02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:56.549
Anthony Taylor: You'll have this way and I'll I'll you know what. Maybe I'll log into my work system. And I'll show you guys.

1350
02:05:57.130 --> 02:05:57.930
Anthony Taylor: bye.

1351
02:05:58.270 --> 02:06:05.129
Anthony Taylor: you know, in another class, I also realize before you go. Thursday is tomorrow. I'm not going to show you scraping tomorrow.

1352
02:06:05.540 --> 02:06:07.629
Anthony Taylor: So let's like, maybe plan.

1353
02:06:07.840 --> 02:06:10.539
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. Wednesday next week, or something.

1354
02:06:10.980 --> 02:06:11.920
Anthony Taylor: Alright

1355
02:06:12.050 --> 02:06:18.380
Anthony Taylor: sound. Good. Okay. guys, that's all I have for you today have a great day. We'll be here for 30.
