00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.219
Anthony Taylor: Expect them to catch up to Microsoft. Oh, Sonia, what's

2
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.350
Clayton Graves: What's going on?

3
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.329
Anthony Taylor: Alright! She must have a reason

4
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.930
Baro, Sonja: like that's how you did

5
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:33.870
Anthony Taylor: I just tell

6
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.440
Anthony Taylor: you were clearly distracted, Clayton.

7
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.649
Anthony Taylor: I actually saw you in the 3D glasses. I would I would just say anything. To be honest.

8
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.730
Anthony Taylor: I thought you really had them on, and and something was going on over there.

9
00:00:47.900 --> 00:01:02.800
Baro, Sonja: But no, I'm just playing. It was amusing. The other day I was, you know, irritating my group, probably with going through them all. So, anyway.

10
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.769
Baro, Sonja: Alright gay! God knows it! I love it.

11
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.330
Anthony Taylor: Distraction with some human that's awesome. So

12
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.039
Anthony Taylor: we're back in the lecture business folks. Now, we're gonna get

13
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:26.849
Anthony Taylor: real series. Okay. You guys probably have asked yourself the question. I got into an AI boot camp.

14
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:36.740
Anthony Taylor: I've learned tons of the new programming language. a whole lot of machine learning. but I haven't heard anyone even mention the word AI, right?

15
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.830
Anthony Taylor: Anybody thought that yourself. It's not entirely true. AI is parent of Ml, but

16
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.700
Anthony Taylor: the reality is is that we haven't really got into the real

17
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:56.629
Anthony Taylor: what everybody thinks of when they think of AI. Well, between now and Project 3, that is what we're going to be doing.

18
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now.

19
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.729
Anthony Taylor: this first one neural networks.

20
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:13.000
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna talk about them today extensively. We're gonna build our own kind of exciting  neural networks is what made it made it

21
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.800
Anthony Taylor: possible for us to get to where we are today with Llms and

22
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.630
Anthony Taylor: just the the Nlp. And everything that we're doing today. Without

23
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.560
Anthony Taylor: the advent of neural networks, we wouldn't have gotten

24
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.660
Anthony Taylor: okay. well.

25
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.399
Anthony Taylor: we would have still been waiting for normal, probably.

26
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:40.260
Anthony Taylor: But they're really super cool. And here's the crazy part. The concept of neural networks has been around since.

27
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.349
Anthony Taylor: if I would guess like a year at least, the first Terminator.

28
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.520
michael mcpherson: 1984

29
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.380
Derek Rikke: sixties, I'm gonna say sixties 42.

30
00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:04.870
Anthony Taylor: Natalie was pretty close. She's like almost the closest. So far in the fifties. The first architecture

31
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.200
Anthony Taylor: that eventually became what we're gonna learn is the perceptron.

32
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:23.900
Anthony Taylor: Okay, was actually created now in the fiftys. A computer with the power of your phone didn't even exist. A computer with a tenth or a fraction of the power of your phone would fill a room.

33
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.829
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so imagine now how far we've come since that first.

34
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.439
Anthony Taylor: you know, hey? Well, what if we did this? And the guy was, you know, they'd probably like, do one perceptron.

35
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.090
Anthony Taylor: and it takes like 2 days to figure it out. Okay, now, we do

36
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.929
Anthony Taylor: billions of perceptrons in

37
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.020
Anthony Taylor: minutes.

38
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.209
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so exciting stuff we'll get into that. You'll see that date again at some point.

39
00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:09.970
Anthony Taylor: Welcome back from Project 2. By the way, one more time freaking project to. We're amazing great work. The guys will get degrading them starting Monday. So expect hopefully by the end of the week you should have your grades. Yes, Natalie.

40
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:33.380
Mason, Natalie: my question on what you just said is, is this, is it because that it has different materials in it? Or is it specific to the software and hard like hardware of the product. No, no. I mean our phones. Yeah.

41
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:45.440
Anthony Taylor: yes. Well, okay, I'm not. In fact, maybe Clayton might give us a better answer. But I'll give you my best answer that I can recall from my hardware days. Okay, it was really silico

42
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:59.079
Anthony Taylor: is what's made it the difference. Alright, we've basically been able to take CPU chips and make them thinner and thinner and thinner and allow them more switches. So everything in a computer is a switch between 0 and one.

43
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.510
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So

44
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.260
Anthony Taylor: in the old days we'd have a switch with, you know, 500 switches that'd be a CPU

45
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.200
Anthony Taylor: can only do 500

46
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:21.169
Anthony Taylor: whatever I like. I'm not gonna say decisions, because the decision could be many of those switches as we got better and better. I mean. I don't even know what the chips today have. I would guess trillions.

47
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:34.020
Anthony Taylor: But there is actually a physics law of Edogenic corruption. Does anybody know the physics law that says you can only go so far. What is it, Meredith? I can't remember the name. No, I don't know that I was thinking of the

48
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:50.360
Meredith McCanse (she/her): the. I don't know sort of theory, that of the like technology increases exponentially and gets 12 gets better twice as fast, and everything gets twice as small on like an exponential curve. But II think you might be talking about something else more is that

49
00:05:50.500 --> 00:06:03.630
Anthony Taylor: that sounds like it, or that there is a term where basically, they said that there is a limit that we can go to. And then you know what they did when we hit the limit instead of one chip, they made 2,

50
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:14.879
Anthony Taylor: and then 3, and then 4, and now 10. So when you even go look at your computer right now, I would say, everybody in here probably has multiprocessor computers

51
00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.900
Anthony Taylor: which have lots of those little fins

52
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.780
Anthony Taylor: 1 billion wafer, you know, cpus on. And as multiple ones.

53
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:34.379
Anthony Taylor: So when you get it now? Clayton was talking about a supercomputer a little while ago, but even beyond that. quantum computing is taking us to a whole nother world.

54
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.790
Anthony Taylor: Okay. I mean, once once that becomes, I mean, it's pretty readily available.

55
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:47.950
Anthony Taylor: You can go on aws, or is your and use a quantum computer today? I mean. It'll cost you, you know, $20 a minute.

56
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.310
Anthony Taylor: but but you could do it.

57
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.320
Clayton Graves: you know you can go feel it from a performance standpoint.

58
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.559
Clayton Graves: Quantum computing is not all that.

59
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:11.830
Clayton Graves: But if you, if you, if you program it, if if you, if your program is is is geared towards it, yes, you you can see some, some pretty much. Yeah.

60
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:21.789
Clayton Graves: so so we're we're super computing has gone nowadays is sort of an expansion of that multiple core thing

61
00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.110
where, instead of having.

62
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:32.629
Clayton Graves: you know, multiple, a processor with multiple cores, you'll have multiple processors with multiple cores on multiple systems.

63
00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:37.660
Clayton Graves: all speaking to each other in a very, very fast, high speed

64
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:45.189
high speed communications network, which is what I'm responsible for is that that communication network

65
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.760
Clayton Graves: that allows all the computer nodes to talk to each other as if they were in the same chassis.

66
00:07:50.150 --> 00:08:00.809
Clayton Graves: And so when you end up with is thousands and thousands and thousands, I think I forget what the number is, but it's it's it's in the hundreds of thousands of compute nodes.

67
00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:06.250
Clayton Graves: all working together on a single issue. And each one of those.

68
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:16.170
Clayton Graves: Each one of those has multiple processors with multiple cores, terabytes of RAM. And it's all working in conjunction with each other. It's amazing.

69
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:31.699
Anthony Taylor: So I have to tell you guys, it's so cool that you asked that question, Natalie, because Clayton told me when he got here today that you know everybody knows Clayton's out of town right now. He's visiting the place where they're building the next big supercomputer, and he was looking at it literally today.

70
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:35.470
Anthony Taylor: So it's kind of cool as it's the timing of this which is spectacular.

71
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:41.529
Anthony Taylor: I will. I do want to show one other thing from a data perspective. We don't use a lot of supercomputers in data.

72
00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:51.060
Anthony Taylor: Okay? What we do more of which, when, as Clayton was describing it, it made me think of it. And I do want to differentiate it for all of you, because I don't want you to hear.

73
00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:52.350
Anthony Taylor: I have.

74
00:08:53.910 --> 00:09:04.640
Anthony Taylor: When I process data, I usually process it on between 10 and 12 different computers, as many as 500 cpus.

75
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:20.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And you're like, holy cow. Isn't that supercomputer? Well, no, the difference between that and what Clayton said, what I'm doing is distributed computing. So what has to happen for this to work is, yeah. I have all these like, say, I have 10 servers.

76
00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:27.109
Anthony Taylor: Then there's another circle. So I actually have 11. The eleventh server is basically

77
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:29.040
Anthony Taylor: orchestrating these 10.

78
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:38.710
Anthony Taylor: What Clinton's talking about. He's got one server that holds, you know, hundreds of servers inside it. So it's incredibly fast way faster than what I'm talking.

79
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.780
Anthony Taylor: However, distributed data is the

80
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:53.999
Anthony Taylor: by far. Well, again, I can't speak for supercomputing, because we don't use supercomputing and data. But distributed dating is data is how we deal with large scale data.

81
00:09:54.490 --> 00:10:00.450
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we don't cover that a lot in this class, we don't go into spark and stuff like that.

82
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.330
Anthony Taylor: But yeah.

83
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.450
Anthony Taylor: that's kind of my specialty is distributed data processing

84
00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.050
Anthony Taylor: of large scale data.

85
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:13.670
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So anyway. that was the coolest sign.

86
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.580
Anthony Taylor: Now, we're only 15 min late.

87
00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:18.840
Anthony Taylor: Hi.

88
00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:24.550
Anthony Taylor: anyway. Hopefully, everybody enjoyed that. That was was just the timing of that could not have been better.

89
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:33.530
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So neural networks. Some examples of neural networks. Okay, we use them every day.

90
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.539
Anthony Taylor: Now, I do want to remind you guys.

91
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:41.849
Anthony Taylor: what's the one thing about our Ml models that we often tend to forget?

92
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:48.870
Anthony Taylor: Does it take long to execute or basically get a prediction from a model.

93
00:10:52.670 --> 00:11:00.960
Anthony Taylor: I see some nods. I see some shades. The answer is, no. Once I train a model, it's basically just a function.

94
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:10.939
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's just it's just a single function bypassing data. It's gonna come back instantly, no matter how long it took to train.

95
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.079
Anthony Taylor: it could take a month to train.

96
00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:19.929
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But when it's done, the execution of the prediction

97
00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:21.970
Anthony Taylor: could be sub-sected.

98
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.470
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So when you see things like, Well.

99
00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:33.269
Anthony Taylor: how does that work with a voice-activated assistant. How is it using a neural network? Well, they use the neural network to train.

100
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:38.569
Anthony Taylor: And then they put the trained model into these devices.

101
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:43.989
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so you're not actually doing the neural network.

102
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:47.089
Anthony Taylor: You're running a trained model.

103
00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:50.839
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But it was a neural network that got you.

104
00:11:51.430 --> 00:12:03.339
Anthony Taylor: So voice activated. Chachi Pt, I love that they they. It's it's an it's a very innovative application of natural language processing. You guys will be doing that.

105
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:15.210
Anthony Taylor: Computer vision is been made possible with neural networks. And recommendation engines are just. I mean. it's so easy for neural networks. It's not even fun.

106
00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.569
Anthony Taylor: Okay. They're just that.

107
00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:22.229
Anthony Taylor: all right. And we're gonna learn how they get to be that good today

108
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.630
Anthony Taylor: all today.

109
00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.170
Anthony Taylor: But what's the problem with neural networks?

110
00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.130
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we've talked about this

111
00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.220
Anthony Taylor: interpretability.

112
00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:37.829
Anthony Taylor: And this gets people really upset right? People are all upset. How does that? AI know that?

113
00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:43.220
Anthony Taylor: How can it do this? I don't understand. Tell me.

114
00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.210
Anthony Taylor: Well, guess what? We don't know.

115
00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:48.090
Anthony Taylor: We know how we built it.

116
00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:54.970
Anthony Taylor: We know in theory, but we cannot tell you how it came up with every decision that it came up with.

117
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.290
Anthony Taylor: okay, we can tell you what the data was. Yes.

118
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:06.190
Baro, Sonja: So I wonder if I've been misunderstanding interpretability all along.

119
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:26.660
Baro, Sonja: because the way you just described. It was more like tran like transparency into the black box is the way I was. Think I was hearing what you were saying, which was, we don't know how it works. It just does right versus when I when I hear interpretability, I think, oh, okay, yeah, I can make sense of that.

120
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:30.730
Anthony Taylor: So? Right? So, yeah, I'm not a terrorist standpoint.

121
00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.419
Anthony Taylor: Right? I've all helped you with that.

122
00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:43.550
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. So from a developer standpoint, that's what you just said. I show you the code, you could follow the code, you get it right. This interpretability goes down to how did it come up with that answer.

123
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:56.999
Anthony Taylor: okay, okay. Now, in some of our models, that's pretty easy to do. We can go look at the output. We can look at some of the statistics, and we can see. Oh, okay, well, yeah, this is how it came up with that answer.

124
00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:09.359
Anthony Taylor: And and with that we can even. It's funny they put Random forest in here, because Random Forest actually gives us a little bit of visualization into interpretability. Right? When we do the features importance.

125
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:17.880
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we can look at that and go. Oh, well, this is going to be, you know. More likely this because it's looking at these factors first.

126
00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:19.649
Anthony Taylor: Yes. Well.

127
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Anthony Taylor: my tears escape

128
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:26.050
Anthony Taylor: But as we get into neural network and deep learning.

129
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:35.889
Anthony Taylor: I mean, there's so much going on that. And and there really isn't a way to see how it came up with that decision. Okay, so

130
00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:39.850
Anthony Taylor: we kind of give away

131
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:48.600
Anthony Taylor: that ability to explain what the model's coming up with to gain the ability to get models that can do

132
00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.110
Anthony Taylor: what used to seem impossible.

133
00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:57.679
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And which, quite frankly, most of the models you guys have worked with thus far

134
00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.339
Anthony Taylor: is impossible.

135
00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:08.009
Anthony Taylor: All right. You guys may have models that were getting like 50 s. And 60 s. But when we put them in neural network they might get 80 S. And 90 S.

136
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:15.169
Anthony Taylor: Okay, because the stuff we've taught you so far is surely a statistical argument.

137
00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:22.180
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And I'm not saying that neural networks isn't also just math, but it's math stacked on top of math

138
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:24.550
Anthony Taylor: a million times over.

139
00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.779
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we're gonna get to that.

140
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:33.039
Anthony Taylor: Alright, what is under network?

141
00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.789
Anthony Taylor: The neural networks effectively.

142
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:46.330
Anthony Taylor: I mean, what are we talking about? Brain? Why do we talk about the brain? What made them think neural network? It's like the brain. Well, they came up with that.

143
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.360
Anthony Taylor: A wow do

144
00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:57.659
Anthony Taylor: because of what's called the perceptron. We're going to look deeper into the perceptron. But the perceptron effectively looks like a neuron

145
00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:05.230
Anthony Taylor: when it's drawn. It looks like a neuron. So if you've ever in your life seen a picture of a neuron on Google.

146
00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:22.309
Anthony Taylor: okay. you ever seen a picture of a neuron? This is basically what a perceptron looks like. And you guys are going to see it. Okay in a little bit.

147
00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:28.669
Anthony Taylor: And so when they built, they said, Hey, it looks like a neuron all the way on neural network. Ha, ha! Ha!

148
00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:29.950
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

149
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:34.350
Anthony Taylor: these were nerds in the 50 s, you're talking the nerdiest of nerds.

150
00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you're nerdiest of nerves.

151
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:44.260
Anthony Taylor: So anyway, so a neural network is basically a whole bunch of perceptrons

152
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.070
Anthony Taylor: talking to each other, taking input outputting

153
00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:49.210
Anthony Taylor: something.

154
00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:53.439
Anthony Taylor: I will say, I will just let you know right now

155
00:16:54.500 --> 00:17:03.359
Anthony Taylor: that you have to train this on a neural network, you have to give it the answer. So what kind of learning is this

156
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.200
Anthony Taylor: still applies

157
00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:07.450
Meredith McCanse (she/her): supervised

158
00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:19.010
Anthony Taylor: supervise? So we still are gonna train with the with the answer. We're not gonna do clustering or anything like that, not saying it can't. It's just not normal. Now, I will tell you. They they

159
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:28.299
Anthony Taylor: you will see neural network referred to as a union, or in in or I mean just any. The reason that we add this A in here?

160
00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:30.430
Anthony Taylor: Okay,

161
00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:42.459
Anthony Taylor: because it's really its official name, because in the next, in the coming weeks you're gonna learn. Cnn, you're gonna learn. Rn. And Cnn is not a news station that makes up stories.

162
00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:54.079
Anthony Taylor: It's actually under our own network. Rnn is not Republican news network.

163
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:59.610
Anthony Taylor: Gosh. I just wanted to see if my Denver class was okay.

164
00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:08.799
Anthony Taylor:  Anyway, there is this Cnn, there is an R and it, we're going to learn all those. Okay. But

165
00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:11.090
Anthony Taylor: today we're going to focus on neural networks.

166
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:15.190
Anthony Taylor: So what is it? Exactly an advanced machine learning

167
00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.809
Anthony Taylor: that contains multiple layers of nodes

168
00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:26.430
Anthony Taylor: which are made up of perceptrons, and they each node performs an individual computation.

169
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:36.610
Anthony Taylor: That's pretty good. Answer. Okay, one of the things. And hopefully, we do this. I haven't looked to see if we're doing this in this class. We used to do it in.

170
00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.899
Anthony Taylor: the data science class is the in this data set

171
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:44.669
Anthony Taylor: super fun. It basically

172
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:51.179
Anthony Taylor: is a bunch of pictures. black and white pictures of handwritten numbers.

173
00:18:51.360 --> 00:19:02.680
Anthony Taylor: And basically we use a neural network to train it on these numbers, so that when you pass in a picture of a handwritten number, it can identify it. Correct, it's basically the most common

174
00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:08.270
Anthony Taylor: vision. Tutorial that you'll see out. Okay.

175
00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:15.219
Anthony Taylor: alright. So this is what the neural network looks like.

176
00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:19.670
Anthony Taylor: okay, so input in this case.

177
00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.579
Anthony Taylor: this tells me, I have 2 inputs.

178
00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:29.749
Anthony Taylor: Okay. all of this in the middle. All this, like turquoise color.

179
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:38.690
Anthony Taylor: is the different node layers. So if I was to look at this, I have 2 inputs, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

180
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:44.290
Anthony Taylor: node layers. I have 3 of them for one output.

181
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:49.000
Anthony Taylor: Now, one output could be almost any.

182
00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:56.419
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you can say, cat dog, that 2 outputs are one. Well, I'm only outputting one or the other.

183
00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.250
Anthony Taylor: Never both.

184
00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:04.959
Clayton Graves: Is there a minimum number of layers you need to have in order to be considered a neural network.

185
00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:14.290
Anthony Taylor: Well, actually, I'll give you a funny thing because they they used to do this right? Technically, what you're seeing on the screen is not under.

186
00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:16.290
Anthony Taylor: It's deep learning.

187
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:22.980
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But what is deep learning. Deep learning is a neural network with more than one hidden layer.

188
00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:36.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So one hidden layer is a neural network. Multiple in layers is deep learning. That's all. Yeah, that's the only difference. So if they still it's all under a

189
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:41.349
Clayton Graves: okay, well, let me repeat that back to you, because I wanna make sure I heard it correctly.

190
00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:49.509
Clayton Graves: One hidden layer is considered a neural network. Multiple hidden layers is considered deep learning.

191
00:20:52.470 --> 00:21:01.669
Anthony Taylor: Yes, that is correct. One hidden layer is a neural network, deep learning still a neural network. But it's considered deep learning. If there is more than one hidden layer.

192
00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:10.919
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I know it's kinda screwing here, but they used to. It's funny, cause the way the the curriculum in the data science class works

193
00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.290
Anthony Taylor: is a.

194
00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:15.300
Anthony Taylor: I lost my mouse. I lost my mouth.

195
00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:25.190
Anthony Taylor: they actually had. They differentiated to the point where we got a whole different lesson for deep learning versus neural network doesn't make sense. It's like adding one more line of code. And now you're a deep learning. But whatever?

196
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.310
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So this is how it works.

197
00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:38.009
Anthony Taylor: We send in stacks of photos images. Now these particular images. let's just stay there.

198
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:52.670
Anthony Taylor: I don't know 128 by 128 Byte. I know. That's a really small picture. Okay? But multiply 128 by 128, you get what? 756 or something like that? 700. So

199
00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:57.349
Anthony Taylor: anyway, the point is, that's how many inputs.

200
00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:11.220
Anthony Taylor: all right. So if this picture was 1,024 by 1,024, multiply those 2 numbers. That's how many inputs.

201
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:14.940
Anthony Taylor: That's a tremendous number.

202
00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:29.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so it takes those inputs and it sends it to the first hidden layer. The first hidden layer. initially, just kind of randomly applies some weight to the value to the things coming in.

203
00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.239
Anthony Taylor: and then

204
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:35.759
Anthony Taylor: does the math sends that the output, the probability

205
00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:39.119
Anthony Taylor: of what it thinks. This is to the next layer

206
00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:43.739
Anthony Taylor: that layer takes the information from the first layer, adds some more weight.

207
00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:53.109
Anthony Taylor: make some adjustments. And ultimately, and you're going to see this visually in a little bit. It basically is just trying to fit it to something.

208
00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.069
Anthony Taylor: and then it outputs the answer.

209
00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:06.909
Anthony Taylor:  when you know. So when you're dealing with pictures, you're talking about a massive amount of, because you basically have an input for every pixel of the picture

210
00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:08.690
Anthony Taylor: video.

211
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:16.150
Anthony Taylor: forget about it's just a ridiculous amount. Okay? But that's how it does

212
00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.879
Anthony Taylor: so it looks at every single pixel

213
00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:26.290
Anthony Taylor: and and determines. Is this a cat, or is this a dog? So as it's training it already knows its cat.

214
00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:34.220
Anthony Taylor: So it's basically just trying to look for patterns in the pixels to say, that's cat. and the same thing with the dog Saddam.

215
00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:40.150
Anthony Taylor: So eventually we'll pass in a picture, and it's going to go. Well, these pixels look most like that

216
00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:53.500
Anthony Taylor: or no. and then tell us the answer. believe it or not. This is a fairly sophisticated test. because while we, as humans, can identify cats and dogs most of the time, really easily.

217
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:55.549
Anthony Taylor: computers really struggle

218
00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:01.360
Anthony Taylor: alright. So this was like one of the first big tests of neural networks. She hasn't.

219
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:14.559
Baro, Sonja: So is there a way that it determines like the waiting, because I would imagine, like a pixel that looks like it's on the edge or the border of the cat. Does that get more weight? You know? How does it

220
00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.570
Baro, Sonja: determine the waiting

221
00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.400
Baro, Sonja: of both.

222
00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:26.890
Anthony Taylor: And this II mean, I don't know if this is where I normally talk about this. I won't get too heavily into it. It's based on contracts.

223
00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:37.760
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that makes sense. Okay? So it's based on contrast. That's how it determines the lines within picture. I do have some fun stuff.

224
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:47.079
Anthony Taylor: probably during R and N. We'll talk about and we'll show how it looks at the picture. But in the end it's shadows and highlights.

225
00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:51.450
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and shadows and highlights are determined by contrast.

226
00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:55.819
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Yeah. So anyway.

227
00:24:56.330 --> 00:25:04.219
Anthony Taylor: I think that's good on it. So alright. So what app? So we train? We have. You know these 4 things, we're gonna train them.

228
00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:17.610
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we train it all goes into our inputs. Whenever we finish training, we can pass in an input. It sends it through the nodes. And then it outputs hopefully the result we've won.

229
00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.679
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's

230
00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:24.800
Anthony Taylor: as simple as it can get. Right? There is of an explanation. Okay.

231
00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:28.600
Anthony Taylor:  we can absolutely do regression

232
00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:34.099
Anthony Taylor: with a neural network. You can do classification with a neural network, but still supervised training.

233
00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.110
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

234
00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:53.389
Anthony Taylor: the problem, as we kind of mentioned earlier, is, we often get into this black box scenario all right. We, we understand that we trained it with 10,000 pictures of cats and 10,000 pictures of dogs.

235
00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:59.379
Anthony Taylor: and then we sent in a picture of that even we were looking at and going

236
00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:07.379
Anthony Taylor: could be a cat could be a dog. Okay, it was probably some ugly bug.

237
00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:11.729
Anthony Taylor: but it was one of those. Wait, nobody has a pug. Right?

238
00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:17.120
Mason, Natalie: Yes. sorry, Natalie. I'm so offended.

239
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:19.200
Pun! Chihuahua.

240
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.090
Anthony Taylor: I don't know.

241
00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.290
Anthony Taylor: stuff. Stop.

242
00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:28.319
Mason, Natalie: Next we had one of those shoes.

243
00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:37.030
Anthony Taylor: So the point is, you can pass it that we're like, I don't get it. But somehow or another the bottle figures it out, and we might be

244
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:41.270
Anthony Taylor: not really sure how I did that.

245
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:57.470
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this becomes even more apparent in like the current Llm situation and stuff like that. One of the big drama around Chat Tpt. And all of these tools is that it's finding stuff that no one understands how it found.

246
00:26:58.410 --> 00:26:59.330
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

247
00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:00.789
Promise you.

248
00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:06.220
Anthony Taylor: It has not created the ability to make its own brain cells

249
00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:10.169
Anthony Taylor: all right. It's just relationships that we didn't see before.

250
00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:18.070
Anthony Taylor: You know, maybe how it got to. Those might be a stretch. But it's it's it's not sent here yet?

251
00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:34.619
Anthony Taylor:  okay, so we actually do, we have an activity. We have a couple of weird activities today. This one's not weird. This is a normal activity.  So what you guys are going to do as just to get your brains back in play

252
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:40.030
Anthony Taylor: is you're gonna go do a real quick, logistic regression.

253
00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:42.739
Anthony Taylor: Model

254
00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.969
Anthony Taylor: on subdiv. You only got to fill out like a cells.

255
00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.680
Anthony Taylor: Okay. though it's no big deal.

256
00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:52.379
Anthony Taylor: Alright, what's going on in chat.

257
00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:56.189
Mason, Natalie: since it is yet.

258
00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.380
Anthony Taylor: Cynthia, yet

259
00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.550
Anthony Taylor: the revolution will not.

260
00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:14.459
Mason, Natalie: Can you elaborate? That was quickly passed over. And that's a very important

261
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.580
Anthony Taylor: conspiracy. People something to work with.

262
00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:31.409
Mason, Natalie: That's a lot of what people are confused about is is this like they? They assume that AI means that it's fully sentient, and that it is going to.

263
00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:37.019
Mason, Natalie: you know, create itself where there's people behind the machines. There's people behind the robots like.

264
00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:45.509
Mason, Natalie: okay, so let's let's play devil's advocate as a group. For a few more minutes since we have a conversational day. Okay.

265
00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:47.960
Anthony Taylor: if you build a robot

266
00:28:49.190 --> 00:29:00.920
Anthony Taylor: that can fully keep itself functioning, in other words, it can charge, recharge itself. It can do everything it needs to do. Let's say it can walk fire guns, it can build things it can do. Whatever

267
00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:03.260
Anthony Taylor: is it possible

268
00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:09.789
Anthony Taylor: that it could based on what it's been trained with. I mean, let's just say it has Chat Gp's brain

269
00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:13.129
Anthony Taylor: couldn't learn to build another robot.

270
00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:16.600
Anthony Taylor: Why not?

271
00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:19.120
Mason, Natalie: If it had the tools

272
00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.890
Clayton Graves: if you trained it to.

273
00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:36.329
Anthony Taylor: Well, that's I'm saying Chatty, Pt. Or something like that, would probably have that that instruction in it. So it would have those instructions. Now, does it have a motion about now? Does it feel a need to build another robot because it needs a companion? Nope.

274
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:40.189
Anthony Taylor: why would it build another robot? I don't know. Maybe it just

275
00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:45.370
Anthony Taylor: decided to build another robot. Well, no, because this is where that black box thing comes into play

276
00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:53.090
Anthony Taylor: right? It's like, well, why would it build another? And would it build it better than itself? Would it simply build it better than itself, and then take itself apart.

277
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:55.330
Clayton Graves: Is it has

278
00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:59.670
Anthony Taylor: the same rank. right? It's still using chat cpt.

279
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.780
Clayton Graves: And I think there's a there's a certain amount of

280
00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:15.980
Clayton Graves: fear that goes into any new technology. I don't know if you guys remember  1520 years ago, that there was the the grey goo fear

281
00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:17.960
Clayton Graves: with nanobots

282
00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:23.090
Clayton Graves: where you would configure self replicating nanobots.

283
00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:29.429
Clayton Graves: who would then go out and autonom autonomously continue to self replicate

284
00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:38.280
Clayton Graves: and gobble up all the the the mass and carbon to use it to create more of itself, and everything would be overtaken by Grey Group.

285
00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:42.160
Clayton Graves: There was a legitimate theme. Why not?

286
00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:44.159
Clayton Graves: It was a legitimate fear.

287
00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:59.820
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, well, I mean, maybe, and I don't know. I don't remember. I don't remember how I mean, if the the only difference I would say between that and this I don't know. If there was actually examples that the public we're seeing outside of like sci-fi.

288
00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:04.670
Anthony Taylor: But today we are seeing robots being built with Llm.

289
00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:07.039
Anthony Taylor: Capabilities built into them.

290
00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:14.929
Anthony Taylor: So how good are they? They're probably the ways people I've I've heard some stuff where they're saying. You know, they're years away from being able to

291
00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:16.179
Anthony Taylor: even like

292
00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:18.949
Anthony Taylor: fully act like a human, not act like

293
00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:20.150
Anthony Taylor: move like

294
00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:27.120
Anthony Taylor:  I don't know why it wouldn't be possible. It's just.

295
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:37.470
Baro, Sonja: you know if if you're creating a robot, and then you just add the the computer piece that could add the Llm. To it. It's

296
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:41.550
Baro, Sonja: it just we don't know how to do it yet or not.

297
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:54.419
Anthony Taylor: I don't.

298
00:31:55.380 --> 00:32:02.420
Anthony Taylor: I mean other than thinking out the technology thinking through the technology. I mean, your opinions on this is just valid is mine.

299
00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:05.500
Anthony Taylor: Right? I mean human bridges. We see what it's doing.

300
00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:10.320
Clayton Graves: Human beings have the capability and the technology to make viruses.

301
00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:22.939
Clayton Graves: computer viruses and arguably real viruses. So it wouldn't be much of a stretch to create a robot that could act as a virus in some aspect.

302
00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:36.449
Clayton Graves: make its drive, to procreate, and constantly, absolutely, this can be done. But we are not at a point where we would be able to create an intelligence that would want to do that.

303
00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.970
Clayton Graves: We can't program to be told to do that. Yes, yeah.

304
00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:47.020
Anthony Taylor: yeah, we aren't at the point. And this is where the whole terminator theories and all this stuff I mean

305
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.540
Anthony Taylor: the Terminator theories are.

306
00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:53.460
Anthony Taylor: we've told the program to protect humanity.

307
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:57.689
Anthony Taylor: and it determined that protecting humanity meant have to destroy humanity

308
00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.060
Anthony Taylor: right? I don't know if the hell it wouldn't say that

309
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:04.040
Anthony Taylor: right? I mean one that didn't have markers on it

310
00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:08.910
Anthony Taylor: right or didn't have blockers, you know security protocols put in place. But

311
00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:18.639
Anthony Taylor: I don't see us as the race, at least for a long time. putting any kind of like, hey? We're gonna give them the button.

312
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:30.019
Anthony Taylor: you know. Let's do that. I do kind of trip out a little bit that, like, you know, going back to what map was saying the other day that I mean, we have probably more drones than we have manned flights these days.

313
00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:42.510
Anthony Taylor: Going, you know, in more stitch, which is great for our pilots. Right? It's great for our pilots. But I mean. wait. You know, how long's it gonna be before someone figures out how to

314
00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:48.819
Anthony Taylor: just take the drone. Yeah, we'll just hack the drone. I don't know how, you know if it's possible.

315
00:33:48.930 --> 00:34:04.000
Anthony Taylor: No idea, not in that department. I have a friend that's in that department, and I'm going to inquire with them. But they just went to like they're all in robotics and doing competitions and stuff. And they're also, they also just got back from a hackathon

316
00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:15.150
Mason, Natalie: in Hawaii. So I'll I'll check in with my buddy. He's the one who talked me into doing this class. Yeah, I'll see what his he, he always has some new update for me. So I'll share with you guys.

317
00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:22.559
Anthony Taylor: I will say that what I show you guys is mostly around like business level stuff and data stuff and

318
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:32.100
Anthony Taylor: fun stuff. But I can't help you with robots. But I think that's cool. I love the conversation. It was fun, all right, but it looks like people falling asleep on me. So

319
00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:36.099
Anthony Taylor: go do your activity. Breakdown.

320
00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.209
Mason, Natalie: Love to hear it.

321
00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:46.079
Anthony Taylor: Hi, gang! Welcome back! How'd you do with thinking on logistic regression model from 4 weeks ago?

322
00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.889
Anthony Taylor: Anybody have any trouble with it? What, Christine?

323
00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:52.760
Anthony Taylor: What group were you in?

324
00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:57.360
Kanouff, Christine: It wasn't the group. It was just me.

325
00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:58.870
Anthony Taylor: Oh.

326
00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:04.619
Kanouff, Christine: okay. But I did have to be told what to type on every line. So that was kind of pathetic.

327
00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:20.670
Anthony Taylor: Oh, come now, it's not pathetic at all. I had to look up an example. I can't do it from memory. I don't expect any of you to do it from memory. In fact, I would have been really impressed if some of you would have went. Got your full pipeline to made last.

328
00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:25.079
Mason, Natalie: That's what the Rodney did in our group.

329
00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.529
Anthony Taylor: That's not bad.

330
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:34.970
Anthony Taylor: Alright. But anyway, okay, so let's just quickly run through this.

331
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:38.650
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

332
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:44.169
Anthony Taylor: So we're just important this data. It's a really simple sample, simple sample

333
00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:52.700
Anthony Taylor: data set just to just get our head back and play. They gave us this cool visual, hey, guys, I don't care what you're doing.

334
00:35:52.810 --> 00:36:04.160
Anthony Taylor: Probably gonna get a hundred percent on this. Okay, this one's so spread out. You really don't even need a model could have just said. anything less than 0 is blue

335
00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:09.900
Anthony Taylor: greater than 0 is green pretty much done. Okay.

336
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:22.220
Anthony Taylor: but we're going to go ahead and prep. It's good practice. Do our train test split. gonna bring in logistic regression. But like they have these cool little extra things in here just to keep it from converging upon itself.

337
00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:30.259
Anthony Taylor: We're going to train our model with our training data. We're going to give predictions with our test data and print out our score

338
00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:33.379
Anthony Taylor: bing, bing! Bing! One big surprise.

339
00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:34.990
Anthony Taylor: That's it.

340
00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:40.949
Anthony Taylor: Any questions before we move on to a perceptron. Yes, Mary.

341
00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:57.959
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I guess it's more of a comment, but I find it compete. I have trouble in my head keeping track of all the different models and what they do. And I do find it confusing that it's called logistic regression when it's a classification model.

342
00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:06.019
Anthony Taylor: that was the first day of logistic regression. That's what we said. That's binary classification.

343
00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:12.060
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yeah. I know I had to look it up again. I just get tripped up by the fact that it has regression in the name.

344
00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:16.030
Anthony Taylor: It's all good. I agree. It's kind of

345
00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:17.750
Anthony Taylor: yeah, it's one of those.

346
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:21.559
Anthony Taylor: But alright, any other questions.

347
00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:28.529
Anthony Taylor: Okay. all right, let's get back to our cool slideshow. Today is a lot of fun lecture.

348
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.069
Anthony Taylor: Perceptron.

349
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.460
Anthony Taylor: So 1950,

350
00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:42.770
Anthony Taylor: when this guy was first made specifically 1957,

351
00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:45.710
Anthony Taylor: that was 10 years before I was born.

352
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:49.479
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's a long time ago

353
00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:59.419
Anthony Taylor: so artificial nerve records become popular, but originally designed off the the perceptron back to 1 57 by Frank Rosenblatt.

354
00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:06.470
Anthony Taylor: He proposed it based on the original Mcp neuron, which was probably before 19.

355
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:15.530
Anthony Taylor: It's an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. Now, you might ask yourself, but wait.

356
00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:19.889
Anthony Taylor: Can't we do more than just binary within neural network. Yes, you can.

357
00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:24.530
Anthony Taylor: Each perceptron is a binary classifier.

358
00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:28.479
Anthony Taylor: Many percept drawings and classify many things.

359
00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:36.660
Anthony Taylor: It enables neurons to learn to process elements in the training set one at a time. Okay, so there you go.

360
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:40.410
Anthony Taylor: But but but but there's the perceptron.

361
00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:44.839
Anthony Taylor: Does it look like a neuron.

362
00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:50.820
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Good. I'm glad. Yeah. Looks like a neuron. Because I would have felt bad if it did.

363
00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:55.339
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so there's 4 specific

364
00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:59.939
Anthony Taylor: things that we want to know about perceptron. And by no, I mean.

365
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:07.270
Anthony Taylor: so we can explain it to our friends. Okay, there's 4 sections.

366
00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:16.310
Anthony Taylor: There's the inputs. This is how many values we're going to pass in to train our model.

367
00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.250
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

368
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:24.369
Anthony Taylor: this could be 1, 2, 202 million

369
00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:29.760
Anthony Taylor: doesn't matter. Okay. as it passes them in.

370
00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:36.799
Anthony Taylor: You know I will. They're we're gonna refer to them as ex to the end or whatever. Okay?

371
00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:49.379
Anthony Taylor: Okay. The next thing it does is it gets its weight coefficient. Now, the next 2 things I'm going to talk about I don't want you to get too hung up on. Okay, when the first

372
00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:55.799
Anthony Taylor: epic of the model occurs. everything is just randomly set.

373
00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.999
Anthony Taylor: So it's just going to randomly throw some weights

374
00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:05.630
Anthony Taylor: on each of these inputs. It had knows nothing at this point.

375
00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:07.840
Anthony Taylor: knows nothing.

376
00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.010
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

377
00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:17.909
Anthony Taylor: So it's just going to randomly throw some weights. The next epic. It's going to go. Well, how far off were, okay, let's adjust those weights.

378
00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:22.170
Anthony Taylor: Then the next epic. Oh, okay, we're still off. Adjust the weights.

379
00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:32.460
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So first, so the inputs come in. They get assigned to these, these nodes. In this case it's single layer.

380
00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:37.429
Anthony Taylor: and they all you have weights that are calculated.

381
00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:44.239
Anthony Taylor: They are sent to this. Now there is. This bias doesn't always have bias.

382
00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:48.299
Anthony Taylor: And this is not the kind of bias that we talked about during headaches.

383
00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:53.239
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this is the kind of bias that says, Hey.

384
00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:56.540
Anthony Taylor: all of these weights are off by like 10%,

385
00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:05.630
Anthony Taylor: apply a but rather than change all the weights, why don't we just apply a bias to affect all of them at once.

386
00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:12.630
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so that's one way. But you don't absolutely have to have. But

387
00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:17.229
Anthony Taylor: okay, it's it's common. But it's it's not required.

388
00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:28.899
Anthony Taylor: You'll see it in almost any perceptron drawing lists. Okay, so now we have all these weights that get calculated. We may apply a bias, which is basically just a modifier.

389
00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:31.829
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to aggregate

390
00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:36.960
Anthony Taylor: the response. Are the the outputs of all of our hidden writer.

391
00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:43.090
Anthony Taylor: Okay. that summation, it's said to.

392
00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:48.950
Anthony Taylor: that's so weird. Why did they stop?

393
00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:59.520
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're gonna that's we're gonna stop there. We're gonna get to the activation function in a second. Okay, it's important. But first, let's go through these other things.

394
00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:03.300
Anthony Taylor: It's a literary didn't like linear, very good

395
00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:12.080
Anthony Taylor: linear binary classifier contains linear regression that separates the 2 into 2 groups. Most common use, so linearly separable.

396
00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:13.749
Anthony Taylor: not linearly separable.

397
00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:23.009
Anthony Taylor: Can a neural network deal with this? Absolutely? Okay. Since we'll provide the model with the features at supervisory talked about that.

398
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:27.179
Anthony Taylor: This is supposed to be an example of it. So

399
00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:34.460
Anthony Taylor: remember how I told you the first epic when the first epic runs, it just draws a line.

400
00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:36.259
Anthony Taylor: has no idea.

401
00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:44.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay, the second epic run, which is an iteration of training. And it goes, hey, you know, we missed one.

402
00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:49.639
Anthony Taylor: Let's make adjustments to our line placement to the weights

403
00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:55.940
Anthony Taylor: and move our line. Okay? So it says, input weights should change. If data's classified blah! Blah blah!

404
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:58.950
Anthony Taylor: But too fast. And the line moved

405
00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:03.560
Anthony Taylor: again. We're gonna see this visually in a few minutes. It's really cool. Yeah, Mary.

406
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:14.840
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Are you using the word epic is that mean like the next iteration of it? What does epic mean in this context?

407
00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:17.179
Anthony Taylor: A training run?

408
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:19.469
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And you and and you know what?

409
00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:23.060
Anthony Taylor: Hold that question, because in a few seconds I'm gonna show you exactly what

410
00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:26.849
Anthony Taylor: like, visually, exactly what it means. I promise.

411
00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:29.580
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Well.

412
00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:33.789
Anthony Taylor: see, I'd rather you guys see tensorflow playground before I show you this.

413
00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:36.299
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna jump ahead.

414
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:38.999
Anthony Taylor: and then come back to this slide.

415
00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:42.630
Anthony Taylor: Okay. let me get to the link.

416
00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:46.409
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to put a link in chats.

417
00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:51.360
Wait.

418
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:53.230
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna get into.

419
00:43:57.550 --> 00:43:59.330
Anthony Taylor: Well, no, you know what we'll do. We'll so

420
00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:06.300
Anthony Taylor: yep, I I'm gonna come back to the demo. But let's just move past it for a second. So the neural network is a single hidden layer.

421
00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:14.300
Anthony Taylor: The structure. We have the input layer. See? We've already covered this. Then we have the hidden layer. And then you have an out. Okay, we're gonna build that

422
00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:21.140
Anthony Taylor: in code in just a moment. Each neuron. Now, this is important. each neuron.

423
00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:26.620
Anthony Taylor: So these 2 items right here have their own distinct output.

424
00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:28.400
Anthony Taylor: They take the inputs.

425
00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:33.790
Anthony Taylor: they apply weight to it, and then they output a probability of

426
00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:41.520
Anthony Taylor: something. Now. if we could say, Oh, it's probability it's cap. This would make it interpretable? Nope, that's not how it works.

427
00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:43.440
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

428
00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:48.570
Anthony Taylor: we don't. We don't know. That's the problem. It's the interpretability problem.

429
00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:57.470
Anthony Taylor: Okay, how does one network combine each neurons output the activation function. So this is part 4 of the perceptron.

430
00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:03.600
Anthony Taylor: So when we build a model, the last thing we're going to do is apply an activation function.

431
00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:08.399
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, you actually, technically put an activation function on every node.

432
00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:18.789
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And you'll see when we build the layers out how to do that.  yeah. Well, here. So you see, activation function in at the end of each one.

433
00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:22.970
Anthony Taylor: It transforms the neural's output into a quantitative value.

434
00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:35.749
Anthony Taylor: and that output becomes the input for the next layer. So hidden layer. One data comes in, applies weights, applies an algorithm output, something, an activation function runs

435
00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:39.159
Anthony Taylor: and gives it a quantitative value

436
00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:47.140
Anthony Taylor: that it passes into the next layer. The next layer receives an output from every single layer before it.

437
00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:52.480
Anthony Taylor: so it goes brutal, and and every one of them get the same thing.

438
00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:56.560
Anthony Taylor: But now they basically think of it, it's been

439
00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:59.560
Anthony Taylor: aggregated for lack of a better term.

440
00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:12.330
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's come up with some decision. Here. It's gonna take those decisions, pass it to this layer. This layer is going to take those decisions, apply its own weights and come up with and pass it to the next layer. If there is a next.

441
00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:18.140
Anthony Taylor: if there's not, it's going to pass it to an activation function. This one right here.

442
00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:20.799
Anthony Taylor: that will then give us the

443
00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:23.800
Anthony Taylor: probability of is this

444
00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:25.280
Anthony Taylor: 0, or what?

445
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:27.899
Anthony Taylor: Alright? Now.

446
00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:34.110
Anthony Taylor: the main ones you're going to see are linear. Obviously.

447
00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:39.220
Anthony Taylor: okay, it's a one sided line. It's a it's 0 on the other. It's what

448
00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:44.099
Anthony Taylor: sigmoid. This is just like the logistic regression discussion.

449
00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:52.509
Anthony Taylor: Remember, when we had this, and we said, Hey, point 5, it's above. It's what if it's below? It's a 0. But we can apply a threshold.

450
00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:55.670
Anthony Taylor: and neural networks will do this for us.

451
00:46:55.850 --> 00:47:06.059
Anthony Taylor: or we can manually override it. But basically, it'll say, Yeah, one's more like 7, 5, or anything higher than point 1 5, it could be anything.

452
00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:10.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay. A tan function is negative one to one.

453
00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:19.889
Anthony Taylor: And again, it just depends on where the threshold that that is determined is a wreck. A relu.

454
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:22.309
Anthony Taylor: I think. Haven't we talked about all these before?

455
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:29.160
Anthony Taylor: I kind of remember talking about all these? No. it's sorry I do this a lot of times. This is the ninth time.

456
00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:33.019
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so relu, it takes the

457
00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:41.370
Anthony Taylor: inputs from all of the nodes. And it, it basically puts them on a 0 to infinity.

458
00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:46.540
Anthony Taylor: So there's no negative values at all. 0 to infinity.

459
00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:55.410
Anthony Taylor: that 0 to infinity. Again, that threshold could be anywhere along this line. whatever that threshold is above. It's a one below. It's a 0.

460
00:47:56.350 --> 00:48:02.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this is pretty cool. In some cases. You notice it's faster.

461
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:06.099
Anthony Taylor: Why? Because it's pretty easy. If it's this, it's that.

462
00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:07.980
Anthony Taylor: But

463
00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:11.779
Anthony Taylor: the leaky relu yet that's a real term.

464
00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:19.160
Anthony Taylor: Okay, they take all the negative numbers, and they just make them smaller or larger technically

465
00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:25.430
Anthony Taylor: right? Because if you make a negative number, negative 12 is is smaller than negative 5.

466
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:30.250
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so it basically allows for some negative numbers.

467
00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:31.870
Anthony Taylor: But

468
00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:35.779
Anthony Taylor: it makes them less so. It tends to work

469
00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:37.150
Anthony Taylor: alright.

470
00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:46.949
Anthony Taylor: The good news is I stopped Christine. She I don't know if it was because it was publicurilu, or she's like, what the hell? Okay? The bottom line is.

471
00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:52.529
Anthony Taylor: if you're using one in 4 that we just talked about. probably fine.

472
00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:58.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you may run into situations where you want to try some other ones.

473
00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:04.080
Anthony Taylor: Give it a try. There's lots of okay. Alright. So

474
00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:13.670
Anthony Taylor: okay, the reason they don't have you go here before now is because we haven't really mentioned the word tensorflow.

475
00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:17.670
Anthony Taylor: Tensorflow is a library

476
00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:24.189
Anthony Taylor: that the in python that allows us to create neural networks.

477
00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:29.880
Anthony Taylor: Very simply. I can tell you. When these first came out I

478
00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:36.710
Anthony Taylor: jumped on them and was trying, and we're not trying. I did do it. But, oh, my God!

479
00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:48.379
Anthony Taylor: Hundreds of lines of code to make one model. It was awful. Then, when Tensorflow came out, as you're going to see in a few minutes, it's like 5,

480
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:53.400
Anthony Taylor: okay ways and performs pretty well.

481
00:49:54.590 --> 00:49:58.640
Anthony Taylor: So we'll get back to this. Let's go to the tensorflow playback.

482
00:49:59.970 --> 00:50:04.190
Anthony Taylor: I'm gonna give you guys a link. Are you guys okay with

483
00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:07.400
Anthony Taylor: in chat? Or would you prefer to slack

484
00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:10.490
Anthony Taylor: a

485
00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:17.189
Meredith McCanse (she/her): in slack so they can access it later if we want to absent? Or

486
00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:19.600
Anthony Taylor: that's a good idea.

487
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:21.709
michael mcpherson: I second Meredith

488
00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:23.730
Anthony Taylor: alright. Alright!

489
00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:26.359
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So here you go.

490
00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:30.120
Anthony Taylor: Who just left was that clear?

491
00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:36.700
Clayton Graves: No, Clayton's still here? No, I'm still hanging out.

492
00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:40.160
Anthony Taylor: well, this is gonna be fun, Clayton, so you'll enjoy this one

493
00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:45.259
Anthony Taylor: alright. So everybody go here.

494
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:53.169
Anthony Taylor: So this should look somewhat familiar to what we've been talking about?

495
00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:57.309
Anthony Taylor: All right, you have an input layer, which is these, X's.

496
00:50:57.830 --> 00:51:01.759
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we have one hidden layer with one neuron.

497
00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:05.230
Anthony Taylor: and we can visually see

498
00:51:06.010 --> 00:51:13.199
Anthony Taylor: what our data points look like up above, we're using an active voice activation function, active VoIP

499
00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:16.040
Anthony Taylor: activation function of sigmoid.

500
00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:22.030
Anthony Taylor: We are trying to do a classification solution. So we just run this. There's your epics.

501
00:51:22.210 --> 00:51:25.849
Anthony Taylor: Meredith. See what's happening up here at the top.

502
00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:30.699
Anthony Taylor: How many iterations are running.

503
00:51:30.850 --> 00:51:36.889
Meredith McCanse (she/her): and Fdpo. CH. That helps. I was thinking, Bp, Icp.

504
00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:43.759
Meredith McCanse (she/her): it's all good that, but that makes sense, because epic that refers to like a time.

505
00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:51.750
Anthony Taylor: There you go.

506
00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:56.790
Anthony Taylor: We can see, this is like the whole thing. But these lines basically

507
00:51:56.870 --> 00:52:00.080
Anthony Taylor: can go in these 2 directions.

508
00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:09.649
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so for this really simple situation, what we're gonna watch is the loss we want to see the loss drop to about 0 0 1

509
00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:12.390
Anthony Taylor: if we can, as low as we think, it's going to get to.

510
00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:25.650
Anthony Taylor: So in 393 epic, we got a point 0 0 one loss. And you could clearly see the line cleanly divides the date.

511
00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:29.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Pretty awesome right?

512
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:34.110
Anthony Taylor: It's not bad now. Why would we want to improve that?

513
00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:37.730
Anthony Taylor: Well, we could by simply

514
00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:42.520
Anthony Taylor:  Well, we could do a number of things and see what they're asking us to do here.

515
00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:46.009
Anthony Taylor: It's there. Input. Yeah, we'll talk about all that.

516
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:49.160
A.

517
00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:56.839
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Okay, talk about all that epic. Okay? So what could we do? Well, we could add another neuron.

518
00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:01.890
Anthony Taylor: Let's run this. See how fast it gets to 0 1,

519
00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:05.159
Anthony Taylor: 217. And

520
00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:12.999
Anthony Taylor: now why do you think I want these epics to be fast or lower number? What does that translate into thing?

521
00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:25.809
Anthony Taylor: More accuracy? Money is true accuracy. We want point 0 0 one regardless. But really it comes down to. And actually, it's funny. When Meredith defined an epic.

522
00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:29.239
Anthony Taylor: she actually kind of said. it's a unit of time.

523
00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:33.949
Anthony Taylor: Okay, our measure of time. What did you say, Mayor? Measure of time?

524
00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:37.759
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I think, I said, like a band of time. But

525
00:53:37.770 --> 00:53:40.739
Anthony Taylor: there you go. That works. It's a good definition.

526
00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:42.870
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So

527
00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:57.680
Anthony Taylor: the doing it faster means we train faster. Alright. So if all it costs me is one extra neuron, and I can train entirely, 33% faster

528
00:53:57.770 --> 00:53:58.960
Anthony Taylor: might be worth it.

529
00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:03.040
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so let's see what happens when we add another.

530
00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:15.540
Baro, Sonja: So, Anthony, adding neurons is that like expanding your cpus, I mean, how do you or like.

531
00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:19.590
Anthony Taylor: how do you measure that? Well, it clearly.

532
00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:26.269
Anthony Taylor: well, that's the goal. But, as you can see, we really didn't save much time adding, an extra girl here did.

533
00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:28.389
Anthony Taylor: it's still 2, 38,

534
00:54:29.170 --> 00:54:44.439
Anthony Taylor: okay? But effectively, it's just adding computation time. Yeah. CPU, okay, if your computer, if your computer couldn't handle it. Then this, really, you're gonna get basically what you're seeing right here is it's not really improving.

535
00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:48.329
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So let's get rid of this guy. Let's check this again.

536
00:54:50.090 --> 00:54:52.400
Anthony Taylor: So we're still there. Let's add a layer.

537
00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:57.720
Anthony Taylor: So now we've gone from neural networks. deep learning.

538
00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:00.349
Anthony Taylor: See if it's any faster

539
00:55:03.730 --> 00:55:05.560
Anthony Taylor: now, actually lost.

540
00:55:06.590 --> 00:55:14.250
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So just because there's more doesn't mean better. So let's go back to one layer. This has been our best so far.

541
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:18.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but we can add another input.

542
00:55:20.890 --> 00:55:22.240
Anthony Taylor: Let's see what that does.

543
00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:26.530
Anthony Taylor: Oh, slightly better.

544
00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:31.319
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So we can do a lot of stuff with this. There's actually.

545
00:55:31.890 --> 00:55:35.560
Anthony Taylor: I don't like this, this tensorflow playground. Hold on.

546
00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:38.819
Anthony Taylor: There's another one like a newer version.

547
00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:44.980
Anthony Taylor: and it's the same people. But it

548
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:49.640
Anthony Taylor: it's just like that. One doesn't feel right? Yeah. I like this one way better.

549
00:55:50.900 --> 00:56:01.050
Anthony Taylor: If you guys go to playground tensorflow.org, you'll see this. It's the same idea. It's I don't know what that one that they put in there. I'm going to put this in slack.

550
00:56:02.330 --> 00:56:04.009
Anthony Taylor: In fact, I'm going to delete the old one.

551
00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:13.969
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Use that. This one's a little cooler. Look.

552
00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:16.470
Anthony Taylor: So this one

553
00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:20.580
Anthony Taylor: watch watch in here. Watch the square as we run it.

554
00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:31.660
Anthony Taylor: You see how you could actually see it moving. Each one of those movements was an epic adjusting the weight. So that was too fast. Right? So let's

555
00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:35.920
Anthony Taylor: let's do this. Let's add a little bit of noise.

556
00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:39.529
Anthony Taylor: Okay, let's see if we can make this go a little slower.

557
00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:42.430
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. alright. Well, here.

558
00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:44.620
Anthony Taylor: let's do this one.

559
00:56:46.040 --> 00:57:04.099
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so your data looks like this when you, when you plot it out. we want it to be able to separate. Now, I want you to watch every as these lines move. keep in mind. What's happening is is it's going. I'm changing the weights. I'm changing the weights. I'm changing the weights until it figures out the right weights

560
00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:06.510
Anthony Taylor: to make this work. So watch this.

561
00:57:19.450 --> 00:57:20.830
Anthony Taylor: So let's just go with that

562
00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:30.460
Anthony Taylor: and see how it moved. I love this. This is like one of my favorite visuals here. It actually every one of those movements was another epic

563
00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:38.459
Anthony Taylor: running and going. I can change the weights. I could do this. I could do that. Perhaps now this one tan works pretty nice.

564
00:57:38.570 --> 00:57:41.920
Anthony Taylor: but we could try like sigmoid. See if this can do it.

565
00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:46.379
Anthony Taylor: I ask you, sigmoid stellar comes

566
00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:52.530
Masarirambi, Rodney: flow.

567
00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:57.250
Anthony Taylor: It's going to get there. But it's going to take a while. Okay?

568
00:57:57.930 --> 00:57:59.940
Let's try the.

569
00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:06.439
Anthony Taylor: Now, this one's interesting. Look at that. Why is it doing that, guys.

570
00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:08.880
Anthony Taylor: Jennifer, why is it doing that?

571
00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:12.640
Anthony Taylor: Any thoughts

572
00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:21.619
Meredith McCanse (she/her): cause those are the negative ones. Right? Good job, both of you. Excellent, exactly

573
00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:28.320
Anthony Taylor: right. Reload doesn't have a negative capability. Okay, but tan. And this one works pretty good

574
00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:32.089
Anthony Taylor: cause. We have negative and positive

575
00:58:32.790 --> 00:58:37.749
Anthony Taylor: we should. Our test loss is really good right now.

576
00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:45.849
Anthony Taylor: But I would bet you, if you let this one run long enough, it'll get all the way to what. But so this goes back to what I saw. You guys

577
00:58:46.130 --> 00:58:49.540
Anthony Taylor: last session before project right?

578
00:58:49.790 --> 00:58:54.319
Anthony Taylor: Neural networks. Give it enough time. We'll figure it out.

579
00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:00.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay. You see how it's just crawling down right now.

580
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.330
Anthony Taylor: but it'll over fit the holy heck out of this

581
00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:10.529
Anthony Taylor: alright. So how do we stop it from overfitting? Well, we just delicate.

582
00:59:11.730 --> 00:59:15.130
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now, couple of other fun things here

583
00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:26.279
Anthony Taylor: that this shows us that a lot of people don't even realize is these lines. You see how some of them are thicker and some of them are thinner. It is. It is telling us that, hey.

584
00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:32.420
Anthony Taylor: the blue icons? The weight is 2.9. It gave it a lot of weight in from this neural

585
00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:34.720
Anthony Taylor: okay?

586
00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:38.040
Anthony Taylor: To this neuron it passed a very low weight.

587
00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:44.210
Anthony Taylor: this one pretty even to both, this one pretty even on the other side, to both.

588
00:59:45.330 --> 00:59:48.610
Anthony Taylor: See how it did that. It's really it's really a cool tool.

589
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:55.879
Anthony Taylor: So we can again, these are pretty high numbers. So let's add a few more inputs. See if we can make this perform better.

590
01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:12.120
Anthony Taylor: Hmm! Now I will tell you, I added, some noise. If you take the noise out.

591
01:00:13.350 --> 01:00:15.419
Anthony Taylor: this will probably go a lot better. Yeah.

592
01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:28.159
Meredith McCanse (she/her): okay, so can you guys see. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Oh, I was gonna ask you, after you explain that. Will you try the data set that's in the bottom right corner. That looks like a spiral.

593
01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:38.090
Anthony Taylor: Get to that one? No, no, no. So this is the next. So these 2 you could argue are linear. Right? Well, let's do one. That's not

594
01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:45.699
Anthony Taylor: okay. And for this one we're only going to stick with exactly what we had. In fact, I'm gonna get rid of

595
01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.269
Anthony Taylor: 2 of these.

596
01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.580
Anthony Taylor: And let's see if we can even get this.

597
01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:55.830
Anthony Taylor: Look at that. It's amazing, isn't it?

598
01:00:57.370 --> 01:01:01.819
Anthony Taylor: I mean that data there, we don't have a model that could do this so far.

599
01:01:02.830 --> 01:01:06.199
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And we did this with just 2 layers, 6 neurons.

600
01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:12.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, let's go to the one Meredith wanted to see. Now, this is a crazy data pattern.

601
01:01:13.810 --> 01:01:18.260
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Watch how hard this will work

602
01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:21.040
Anthony Taylor: to try to figure this out.

603
01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.669
Anthony Taylor: It literally looks like it's straining, doesn't it?

604
01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:43.570
Anthony Taylor: Now the question is, is, will it ever? Well, the answer is, is, probably

605
01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:48.030
Anthony Taylor: sometimes we just didn't give it enough to solve the problem.

606
01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:51.349
Anthony Taylor: So how do we give it more? So let's go ahead and stop this.

607
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:54.780
Anthony Taylor: and let's grab another layer.

608
01:01:58.490 --> 01:02:02.160
Anthony Taylor: We'll give it this many. Let's see if this can do it.

609
01:02:12.350 --> 01:02:20.729
Anthony Taylor: So you see, all those weights getting adjusted. This is, I mean, it's magical to think about what's happening, you know, mathematically in the back.

610
01:02:23.350 --> 01:02:25.720
Anthony Taylor: I mean, it just keeps doing this. And

611
01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:32.469
Mason, Natalie: I have a question, are you just like guessing how many of these to use with each layer

612
01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:38.609
Anthony Taylor: 100%. If there is no quantitative way other than let's try it. See?

613
01:02:39.070 --> 01:02:53.419
Mason, Natalie: Hmm, cause it would make sense to me in my brain that there needs to be more features, and then it gets smaller to funnel down the information. But I guess that's not necessarily what's happening

614
01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:56.039
Anthony Taylor: that let's see if you're right.

615
01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:08.069
Anthony Taylor: So I don't know if you need to. You don't have to do less neurons. But we could do that. Let's let's do something like that. I will tell you. Typically, you want to have almost as many in your first layer as you have in your inputs.

616
01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:11.340
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but we'll leave it like this. Let's just see what we get.

617
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:15.450
Anthony Taylor: Whoa

618
01:03:17.970 --> 01:03:19.870
Masarirambi, Rodney: has, like lots of tension

619
01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:21.050
Masarirambi, Rodney: more slow.

620
01:03:21.070 --> 01:03:25.259
Mason, Natalie: But look at that. I mean, it's very good.

621
01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:27.750
Mason, Natalie: So it's funneling down.

622
01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:33.319
Anthony Taylor: No, it has. It is is less to do with funneling down and more to do with how many features we passed.

623
01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:39.410
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so I mean we could. We could make these again.

624
01:03:39.490 --> 01:03:42.459
Anthony Taylor: and it might do a little better. Let's see.

625
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:50.659
Anthony Taylor: I mean, it looks like it may eventually get there.

626
01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:53.630
Anthony Taylor: Oh, yeah, here we go.

627
01:03:57.310 --> 01:04:02.870
Anthony Taylor: See how the weights are getting closer, lower and lower. So this will get. Yes, Christine.

628
01:04:04.270 --> 01:04:12.750
Kanouff, Christine: so what's like, what's the business case? Or can you bump this up, maybe to a 30,000 foot view?

629
01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:25.570
Kanouff, Christine: Is there any way to make some assumptions about? Why you would move into neural networks. Is it just because you're not getting predictable results? So now you're taking it to this level

630
01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.460
Anthony Taylor: correct, you're basically at. Well.

631
01:04:30.330 --> 01:04:36.260
Anthony Taylor: II know a lot of data scientists that just start at this level. They said, you know what? I'm just gonna start

632
01:04:36.610 --> 01:04:41.229
Anthony Taylor: right? Because we know we'll get the answer from this. We just know.

633
01:04:41.570 --> 01:04:43.300
Anthony Taylor: and we can build it

634
01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:47.439
Anthony Taylor: from here, and we will. There's almost no.

635
01:04:49.450 --> 01:04:53.539
Anthony Taylor: there's no pattern we can't match now. There could be no pattern

636
01:04:54.780 --> 01:05:02.190
Anthony Taylor: if it's just noise, there's no path. So it doesn't mean your machine learning model is always going to get a hundred percent or 90%.

637
01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:11.610
Anthony Taylor: Okay, what it means is that if you have a crazy pattern that that that probably would fit in most of the machine learning models you've learned so far.

638
01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:16.909
Anthony Taylor: neural networks will figure it out. If there is a pattern, it'll fight.

639
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:22.180
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So the the business justification for neural networks is.

640
01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:29.390
Anthony Taylor: I mean, it just works. Is it harder to code? Is it harder to work with? Is it more expensive? Yes, yes, and yes.

641
01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:32.170
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But

642
01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:38.529
Anthony Taylor: if you have somebody like you guys who know how to make em and know how to train em

643
01:05:39.790 --> 01:05:46.760
Anthony Taylor: know how to tune them. You can use neural networks just like any other model, and you'll get better results.

644
01:05:47.130 --> 01:05:54.289
Anthony Taylor: Because, again, even if it takes hours to train this. the final result will take milliseconds

645
01:05:54.740 --> 01:06:01.870
Anthony Taylor: because it's just building it out. The basically a formula that it can calculate, given certain inference.

646
01:06:03.110 --> 01:06:04.470
Anthony Taylor: So anyway.

647
01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:10.769
Anthony Taylor: the the bottom line is, you can play around with layers. You can play around with features.

648
01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:14.690
Anthony Taylor:  you can do a lot

649
01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:19.319
Anthony Taylor: you could play around with like I don't know that that tan was the best.

650
01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:23.190
Anthony Taylor: I don't know that one might not work at all. Let's see.

651
01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:28.510
Anthony Taylor: there's like nothing happened.

652
01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:39.899
Anthony Taylor: Maybe maybe tan's the only one that works in this.

653
01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:43.800
Anthony Taylor: Oh, no.

654
01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:55.049
Anthony Taylor: that's so cool. I get such a kick out of watching it do this movement thing. I'm just like to me. This is just

655
01:06:55.500 --> 01:07:07.429
Anthony Taylor: I mean, and I'm not that much of a geek. I know you guys don't that? But  it's it's just exciting to see how this works in such a visual way. It's it's just really cool

656
01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:17.610
Anthony Taylor: as as, an educator of this material. This, to me, is the most visual way to explain enrollment.

657
01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:23.310
Anthony Taylor: So are you guys following what's happening? Is everyone feeling? Okay with this, Christine. I saw you on mute.

658
01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:30.309
Kanouff, Christine: Well, I was just gonna ask how? No, how large of a data set is this working on right now

659
01:07:30.970 --> 01:07:34.170
Kanouff, Christine: can is it's telling us that anyone

660
01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:40.499
Anthony Taylor: it does. It might say, somewhere in the documentation, we can actually like, train the train test split on it.

661
01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:46.590
Anthony Taylor: We can change the batch sizes. We can change how much noise, just for this visual that we're looking at right now.

662
01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:51.130
Anthony Taylor:  I don't know. I honestly don't know. To be honest with

663
01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:54.660
Anthony Taylor: II mean, it's, however, many dots you see on the screen.

664
01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:59.009
Anthony Taylor: So it could be. Yeah, maybe a thousand or so.

665
01:08:00.070 --> 01:08:06.549
Anthony Taylor: But I will say this. Notice that right now I'm at 2,500 epics, and I'm at 0 0 9 0.

666
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:08.829
Anthony Taylor: This might be perfectly acceptable.

667
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:13.399
Anthony Taylor: And you're like, Well, gosh, it was a lot of ethics. It's like, yeah.

668
01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:19.749
Anthony Taylor: So you pay for the training. But you get the best answer. Is it over fit. Not yet.

669
01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:24.609
Anthony Taylor: right? It's still generalizing. So it's not bad.

670
01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.380
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

671
01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:37.659
Anthony Taylor: very exciting stuff. So feel free to fiddle around in here, you know, whatever you want to do? It has a lot of other information on here. You can read about.

672
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:49.329
Anthony Taylor: You can actually see the the test data if you switch it to test data. You can see the the dots that were actually test data

673
01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:51.969
Anthony Taylor: that it was using to come up with the lost

674
01:08:53.270 --> 01:08:54.029
Anthony Taylor: so

675
01:08:56.330 --> 01:08:59.859
Anthony Taylor: pretty excited. I loved its food. It's like.

676
01:08:59.970 --> 01:09:08.420
Anthony Taylor: I think I love tensorflow so much because I did do it before tensorflow existed. And and I don't even know it's like it's like

677
01:09:09.939 --> 01:09:15.410
Anthony Taylor: it's like, if you ever like. you know, cooked before microwaves existed.

678
01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:26.910
Anthony Taylor: Right? You know it was it just changed? You love microwaves. You're like, okay with microwave alright, cause you're like, Oh, my God, life is easier. Okay.

679
01:09:27.290 --> 01:09:32.389
Anthony Taylor: but anyway. I don't know if that was a great example. But I like.

680
01:09:32.649 --> 01:09:35.320
Anthony Taylor: okay. So now.

681
01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:41.689
Anthony Taylor: how we doing, we're doing okay, we're gonna go a little over. But I'm gonna show you my demo

682
01:09:44.270 --> 01:09:49.680
Anthony Taylor: of how to make a neural network. Okay. now.

683
01:09:50.930 --> 01:10:01.470
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to tell you I'm kind of glad we have our little extra thoughts today, because what they wanted me to do is show you this, send you to break. Come back. And then we do this together.

684
01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:05.620
Anthony Taylor: So I say this, let's just do this together.

685
01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:09.469
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but you guys already have the solution.

686
01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:11.430
Anthony Taylor: So you're gonna do one

687
01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:15.159
Anthony Taylor: in the next activity. Don't sweat it.

688
01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:18.049
Anthony Taylor: but we'll walk through this very slowly and careful.

689
01:10:18.230 --> 01:10:19.980
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so

690
01:10:21.810 --> 01:10:24.530
Anthony Taylor: nothing new except

691
01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:31.160
Anthony Taylor: import tensorflow in or so I will tell you. We might have a problem here, so I want everybody

692
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:33.149
Anthony Taylor: to run this first cell.

693
01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:38.050
Anthony Taylor: You might as well go ahead and run hip, install tensorflow

694
01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:39.940
Anthony Taylor: first.

695
01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:42.120
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

696
01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:45.129
Anthony Taylor: So that you don't run into.

697
01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:48.639
I mean, cause I guarantee you none of you have it.

698
01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:56.739
Anthony Taylor: Well, that's not true. Somebody who's already like taking a like big brand. because I know he's taking some classes on this.

699
01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:00.119
Anthony Taylor: So once you've installed that

700
01:11:03.070 --> 01:11:04.450
Anthony Taylor: run this first cell.

701
01:11:09.710 --> 01:11:13.480
Anthony Taylor: Now, if for some reason your tensorflow install does not work.

702
01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:18.810
Anthony Taylor: you know, I may send you over to Colab. We're not going to troubleshoot. Everybody's tensorflow.

703
01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:22.680
Anthony Taylor: Okay, is it working for advice? So far.

704
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:27.850
Mason, Natalie: it's taking a line time to install?

705
01:11:27.930 --> 01:11:30.400
Anthony Taylor: It does take a lot of stuff. Yeah.

706
01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:31.810
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Mine worked.

707
01:11:32.350 --> 01:11:36.699
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I see Mac and window users. So I'm gonna assume we're working.

708
01:11:36.850 --> 01:11:38.100
Anthony Taylor: So let's keep moving.

709
01:11:38.450 --> 01:11:49.210
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so it's just that library. That's it. All right, we're gonna bring in some data and we'll plot it out. So you guys can see, this is the same sample data from earlier.

710
01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:57.040
Anthony Taylor: Again, this is going to be a hundred percent match. There's no way to not match this. But that's okay. We're just learning how to bake it.

711
01:11:57.890 --> 01:12:01.109
We're still gonna do our train test split.

712
01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:05.610
Anthony Taylor: We must serve. Well.

713
01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:10.150
Anthony Taylor: you definitely want to scale when you're doing neural networks.

714
01:12:10.990 --> 01:12:12.080
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

715
01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:19.070
Anthony Taylor: Also, just as a side note, you must have all members.

716
01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:23.269
Anthony Taylor: You just must. There is no way around.

717
01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:26.040
Anthony Taylor: There is no ever. Is that different?

718
01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:30.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so to get the model, remember, model fit. Predict

719
01:12:30.290 --> 01:12:32.410
Anthony Taylor: we're going to bring in

720
01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:37.559
Anthony Taylor: Tf Kiras dot models sequential

721
01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:41.039
Anthony Taylor: and assign it to Indian model.

722
01:12:41.370 --> 01:12:43.300
Anthony Taylor: Don't worry about these warnings right now.

723
01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:48.449
Anthony Taylor: So our input, nodes. We're gonna say, you know, what?

724
01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:54.169
Anthony Taylor: What did I tell you guys earlier? You need an input for every feature, every incoming value.

725
01:12:54.360 --> 01:13:00.770
Anthony Taylor: So you know. And from what we've done before we're talking about the features in our table. So if our table as

726
01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:02.519
Anthony Taylor: 28 columns.

727
01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:07.319
Anthony Taylor: right, we're going to basically have 27 inputs

728
01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:10.349
Anthony Taylor: cause one predictor went a leap. Right?

729
01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:15.070
Anthony Taylor: So this is a really clean way to get the number of input notes.

730
01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:18.720
Anthony Taylor: Say, give me how many columns are in my X variable.

731
01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:21.770
Anthony Taylor: So first layer.

732
01:13:22.510 --> 01:13:24.929
Anthony Taylor: visually speaking, this is.

733
01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:31.999
Anthony Taylor: we find, the one from up above

734
01:13:33.730 --> 01:13:34.900
Anthony Taylor: this layer.

735
01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:42.259
Anthony Taylor: Okay, well, technically, it starts with this one. But then it also includes that first layer. So we're gonna say.

736
01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:44.330
Anthony Taylor: give me a layer

737
01:13:45.070 --> 01:13:47.610
Anthony Taylor: that has 5 units.

738
01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:54.870
Anthony Taylor: uses the relu activation and has whatever which we know is 2, right?

739
01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:13.040
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. And so, and then it has 2 inputs. where'd it go? Right? So what does that look like? Well, you know what. Actually, I got a cooler idea. Let's do it with tensorflow. So if I was drawing this in tensorflow

740
01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:15.370
Anthony Taylor: right now.

741
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.289
Anthony Taylor: this is what I've got what you see on the screen.

742
01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:22.390
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

743
01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.300
Anthony Taylor: 2 inputs.

744
01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:28.439
Anthony Taylor: 5 notes.

745
01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:33.380
Anthony Taylor: So 2 inputs. And the first layer is what's being drawn.

746
01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:35.100
Anthony Taylor: Aye.

747
01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:42.869
Anthony Taylor:  Now, what they want us to do is just do a regular neural network. We're not gonna do deep learning. Which means, what?

748
01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:45.100
Anthony Taylor: How many layers are we going to have?

749
01:14:46.230 --> 01:14:48.100
Anthony Taylor: What? So

750
01:14:48.370 --> 01:14:53.479
Anthony Taylor: the only thing you're going to have is this first layer and an output.

751
01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:58.650
Anthony Taylor: The output looks exactly the same, except

752
01:14:59.710 --> 01:15:03.799
Anthony Taylor: it had the units in the output is how many

753
01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:04.940
Anthony Taylor: output

754
01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:07.759
Anthony Taylor: columns you you are possible

755
01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:12.329
Anthony Taylor: in our case. There's only one. Okay, it's whatever

756
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:16.479
Anthony Taylor: it's either, you know, whatever one or 0 looks like.

757
01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:30.179
Anthony Taylor: okay.  and our activation, our final activation. We're going to use sigmoid. This is at the hidden layer level.

758
01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:33.339
Anthony Taylor: Typically in this class, we're going to use. Relu.

759
01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:35.789
Anthony Taylor: This is at the output.

760
01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:39.539
Anthony Taylor: the final like determination.

761
01:15:39.770 --> 01:15:43.610
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I will tell you. While you're in this class.

762
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:49.759
Anthony Taylor: If you see sigmoid, they probably are referring to the output almost every time.

763
01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:58.899
Anthony Taylor: Now, the cool thing is we can run these, create our first layer, create our second layer. The model has a a

764
01:15:59.250 --> 01:16:03.050
Anthony Taylor: a method called Summary. And it'll basically show us

765
01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:04.230
Anthony Taylor: we have

766
01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:10.049
Anthony Taylor: a dense layer where it says 15 parameters.

767
01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:13.070
Anthony Taylor: and then another one with 6 parameters.

768
01:16:14.230 --> 01:16:16.419
Anthony Taylor: Okay, why do you think that is

769
01:16:20.610 --> 01:16:21.550
Anthony Taylor: actually.

770
01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:25.160
Anthony Taylor: why am I struggling with that? Hold on parameters? 15.

771
01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:27.910
Anthony Taylor: It is. There is a calculation to that.

772
01:16:28.090 --> 01:16:35.060
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna come back to that. The parameters is is that? That's not features.

773
01:16:36.290 --> 01:16:39.860
Anthony Taylor: No, but it's a calculation of everything on the screen.

774
01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:43.390
Anthony Taylor: So like how many lines, how many.

775
01:16:43.490 --> 01:16:45.949
Baro, Sonja: how many times the

776
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:53.880
Anthony Taylor: the number of calculations? 2. Gotcha gotcha, 4, 5, 6,

777
01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:58.699
Anthony Taylor: 8, 9, 1011, 1213, 1415

778
01:16:58.860 --> 01:17:05.439
Anthony Taylor: right? And then the output which you don't really see here only has one, but it has 5 coming into it.

779
01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:14.400
Baro, Sonja: And this is important is we would use that value of knowing parameters. For what purpose?

780
01:17:14.770 --> 01:17:23.890
Anthony Taylor: You wouldn't. It's just it's it's just information, right? This is just so you can visualize what's built before you execute.

781
01:17:24.150 --> 01:17:31.269
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So you have 5, and you have what you have. One layer with 5 feet knows notice. It doesn't even tell us the input.

782
01:17:31.690 --> 01:17:35.100
Anthony Taylor: so we just yeah, we just have to go with.

783
01:17:35.310 --> 01:17:36.160
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

784
01:17:36.580 --> 01:17:47.450
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So now, this is the only thing different in a neural network versus everything we've done so far instead of model fit. Predict it's model

785
01:17:47.770 --> 01:17:50.450
Anthony Taylor: compile fit.

786
01:17:51.870 --> 01:17:57.689
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So what this is gonna do is it's gonna use this binary cross entropy.

787
01:17:57.730 --> 01:18:09.159
Anthony Taylor: loss, calculation. There's a couple of them feel free to look them up. This is the one we're gonna use. Okay, there is an optimizer just like 4 or 5 of them again.

788
01:18:09.550 --> 01:18:14.820
Anthony Taylor: feel free to look them up. We will look more into these when we go into tune

789
01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:23.100
Anthony Taylor: right now. just use these, or you can look them up if you really want to. The metric we're going to use is accuracy.

790
01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:40.330
Anthony Taylor: That's what we're gonna tell it to use as its metric. Once it's compiled. we can now fit. So model, compile, fit, predict. The fit is just like every fit we've done so far. With one exception.

791
01:18:40.370 --> 01:18:44.180
Anthony Taylor: we're going to tell it. How many epics we want it to run.

792
01:18:45.230 --> 01:18:49.330
Anthony Taylor: Now, you guys saw in tensor playground a hundred is fast.

793
01:18:51.970 --> 01:18:54.060
Anthony Taylor: right? So

794
01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:57.349
Anthony Taylor: I mean. maybe that that may not be enough.

795
01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:02.510
Anthony Taylor: Now, we know our data right now is super simple. So it's probably gonna be fun.

796
01:19:03.170 --> 01:19:04.070
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

797
01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:13.209
Anthony Taylor:  so we can run that it's going to compile it, and it's going to run. It's going to train 100 times

798
01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:20.430
Anthony Taylor: now the cool thing. Since this is fairly verbose, we can actually watch the accuracy go up

799
01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:22.419
Anthony Taylor: and the loss go down.

800
01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:30.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so that's pretty good.

801
01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:37.420
Anthony Taylor: We can. Also, we can create data frame by just using. And it takes the history. Yes, merit.

802
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:41.530
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So would you use that to decide how many

803
01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:49.790
Meredith McCanse (she/her): like would you look at that and find where the loss gets down to point 0 0 one and then change it so that the number of epics is that number.

804
01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:57.459
Anthony Taylor: I love that idea. So yes, you would want to get what you want to basically do is, look where the loss starts to stop

805
01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:02.500
Anthony Taylor: right? And you can't really tell here, cause. See, we got to 10 and then jump to 99.

806
01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:05.789
Anthony Taylor: But right here, we're gonna create a data frame

807
01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:11.230
Anthony Taylor: that that takes that entire history. And we're gonna plot out loss.

808
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:13.360
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

809
01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:23.009
Anthony Taylor: so we can see it drop and drop and drop and drop and drop in. And I mean, you could probably have stopped this somewhere in here.

810
01:20:23.290 --> 01:20:30.790
Anthony Taylor: and you probably would have been fine. Okay? 100 epics is so small. Yeah, so

811
01:20:30.930 --> 01:20:39.099
Baro, Sonja: would would we expect potential to get a different graph result? Potentially same? Input.

812
01:20:39.590 --> 01:20:45.610
Anthony Taylor: yes, we didn't do a random seed, so it's possible it won't be substantially different, I would think

813
01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:49.170
Anthony Taylor: is you're substantially different.

814
01:20:49.230 --> 01:20:51.830
Baro, Sonja: Well, I mean, yeah, it goes

815
01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:56.209
Baro, Sonja: down, but it it goes down more dramatically and then over

816
01:20:56.730 --> 01:21:03.080
Anthony Taylor: alright. Well, it's possible it's entirely possible. There's Random.

817
01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:06.170
Baro, Sonja: because we didn't random state. Go ahead. Exactly.

818
01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:11.100
Anthony Taylor: Remember what I talked about with the weights is when they start they could be anywhere.

819
01:21:11.470 --> 01:21:13.229
Baro, Sonja: Oh, that's right. Okay.

820
01:21:13.290 --> 01:21:18.089
Anthony Taylor: right? So once they start, I mean, maybe you guessed better. Yours guessed better than mine did

821
01:21:18.910 --> 01:21:25.200
Anthony Taylor: right off the bat. So it would take less efforts. It absolutely is possible. Right?

822
01:21:25.570 --> 01:21:26.880
Anthony Taylor: so

823
01:21:30.710 --> 01:21:37.669
Anthony Taylor:  yeah, okay. So we can also do the same thing with accuracy. So we can say same data frame

824
01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:42.619
Anthony Taylor: and run an accuracy chart. But we could see we hit it

825
01:21:42.710 --> 01:21:44.779
Anthony Taylor: like, really fast.

826
01:21:45.930 --> 01:21:48.279
Anthony Taylor: Okay, like, really fast.

827
01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:59.179
Anthony Taylor: So you know, this one? Well, we hit the accuracy quick. We just wanted to get good loss. And I mean our cutoff was like point one. We could probably stop 60.

828
01:21:59.870 --> 01:22:02.329
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you don't have to do these charts.

829
01:22:03.610 --> 01:22:10.639
Anthony Taylor: You can actually well, here, we're going to run the the evaluate. So we're passing in our test data now.

830
01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:18.509
Anthony Taylor: And it tells us how it finished. Okay, but you can actually look at that data frame if you wanted to.

831
01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:23.049
Anthony Taylor: And just kinda get an idea what data

832
01:22:23.190 --> 01:22:24.400
Anthony Taylor: looks like.

833
01:22:29.050 --> 01:22:37.880
Anthony Taylor: I mean, it's keeping in mind. The index is the epic. right? So you could look at this whole data frame and

834
01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:44.530
Anthony Taylor: well, I mean, you could expand the whole thing. Trust me. And then you could see where these numbers start to look up

835
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:49.159
Anthony Taylor: so. But the charts do a nice job, and they're fairly simple.

836
01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:51.509
Anthony Taylor: Hi!

837
01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:54.440
Anthony Taylor: Questions.

838
01:22:54.610 --> 01:22:55.470
Sihong Zhou: Yes.

839
01:22:55.610 --> 01:22:56.820
Anthony Taylor: yes, Derek.

840
01:22:57.210 --> 01:22:59.530
Anthony Taylor: Derek got his hand up. Hold on Cindy.

841
01:22:59.630 --> 01:23:00.450
Sihong Zhou: Okay.

842
01:23:00.710 --> 01:23:07.920
Derek Rikke:  is loss and accuracy. Are they like directly inverted or like, what's

843
01:23:08.330 --> 01:23:10.239
Derek Rikke: would you use one or the other?

844
01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:14.289
Anthony Taylor: Well, so there's they. They do different things.

845
01:23:14.410 --> 01:23:17.070
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so loss is telling us

846
01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:22.560
Anthony Taylor: how basically how clean our our predictions are.

847
01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:31.380
Anthony Taylor: Okay, the lower that number the more perfect we are okay with our ability to predict. And I can, I'll get you a better definition.

848
01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:39.030
Anthony Taylor: Accuracy is the same accuracy that we've had before. It's basically the R 2 school. Okay?

849
01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:47.170
Anthony Taylor: We we already know that accuracy has its own issues right? There are better ways to do it.

850
01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:55.380
Anthony Taylor: Just as loss is great. But to to think you're gonna get a point 0 0 0 one is ridiculous

851
01:23:55.870 --> 01:23:57.250
Anthony Taylor: in real world data.

852
01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:11.090
Anthony Taylor: all right. But the goal is, if you, if you wanted to say, are they advert? You know what? Inverted from one another sort of we want to see the highest accuracy with the lowest loss. That's just it.

853
01:24:11.790 --> 01:24:14.769
Anthony Taylor: are they? I mean, as you can see, this took

854
01:24:15.290 --> 01:24:18.719
Anthony Taylor: almost 80 epics to get to the lowest loss.

855
01:24:19.130 --> 01:24:23.040
Anthony Taylor: but we were at the highest accuracy within with less than 20.

856
01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:28.309
Anthony Taylor: So they're not inverse. But they're just 2 separate measurements that we want to look at.

857
01:24:28.580 --> 01:24:33.769
Anthony Taylor: Hi, I'm gonna go ahead and grab Cindy, Natalie, though you raise your hand, Cindy. and then, Nano.

858
01:24:36.130 --> 01:24:47.419
Sihong Zhou: So I just have a question like for the plot of the accuracy. It seems so from from 20 times 20 apex.

859
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:56.969
Sihong Zhou: another 20. It's kind of like a 15 right? Oh, wow! So it means like

860
01:24:57.090 --> 01:25:14.639
Sihong Zhou: If we want to find something like the to save to most the timing efficiency, we should adjust to try 10. A apex, a pox, right? Or what? Well, take into account the loss.

861
01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:17.249
Anthony Taylor: Okay, the last

862
01:25:17.970 --> 01:25:24.080
Anthony Taylor: right cause. Remember, the other chart is showing us. So we want the lowest loss possible.

863
01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:27.470
Sihong Zhou: A, okay.

864
01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:35.310
Anthony Taylor: okay. So and I did. I went ahead and and did a quick

865
01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:38.080
Anthony Taylor: quick!

866
01:25:39.210 --> 01:25:43.469
Anthony Taylor: The loss is the difference between the predicted value and the actual value.

867
01:25:44.970 --> 01:25:49.710
Anthony Taylor: Alright, that is the definition. There's a whole bunch more. You can get out of that.

868
01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:54.959
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, it's the loss between the predicted value and the actual value.

869
01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.069
Anthony Taylor: So clearly. So what we want is that number to be as small as possible.

870
01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:02.640
Anthony Taylor: and accuracy to be as large as possible.

871
01:26:03.610 --> 01:26:09.700
Anthony Taylor: But remember, you also don't want to over fit. We haven't even got into overfitting yet. And but

872
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.859
Anthony Taylor: tensorflow, it's really easy to overfit

873
01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:17.710
Anthony Taylor: cause, as you guys saw, we can make that duck done line move all over place.

874
01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:22.280
Anthony Taylor: Given enough ethics. Okay? So

875
01:26:23.330 --> 01:26:24.460
Anthony Taylor: your

876
01:26:24.850 --> 01:26:31.430
Anthony Taylor: while you're right, you got to accuracy really fast. We still had a lot of loss. So our model's still not great.

877
01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:34.680
The model was best at about.

878
01:26:35.110 --> 01:26:37.649
Anthony Taylor: probably somewhere in like 75.

879
01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:43.289
Anthony Taylor: Okay, cause our loss at that point was pretty stable.

880
01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:45.830
Sihong Zhou: so like

881
01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:47.460
so like

882
01:26:47.950 --> 01:26:56.519
Sihong Zhou: like so why, the epoch epics kind of like the how many times you run it? Right?

883
01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:02.730
Sihong Zhou: Company training session. Yeah, it's session. How many times right

884
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:08.769
Sihong Zhou: can I take the training session as regard re, can I take it as

885
01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:11.940
Sihong Zhou: a combination of different feature?

886
01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:16.380
Sihong Zhou: Kind of like? No. So it's different.

887
01:27:16.650 --> 01:27:21.709
Anthony Taylor: no. Every epic is gonna so if you remember from the training playground.

888
01:27:24.190 --> 01:27:29.339
Anthony Taylor: every time it does an epic, it's adjusting the weights.

889
01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:35.600
Anthony Taylor: Okay, like this one's never gonna work. But it's adjusting the weights. And that's these lines that are moving right now.

890
01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:43.170
Anthony Taylor: That's tensorflow adjusting the weights as it does in epic. Okay?

891
01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:47.289
And it'll just keep adjusting. I'm trying to fit this data.

892
01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:50.110
Anthony Taylor: I mean, until either it gives up or we give up.

893
01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:57.690
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, and and the way we can make this better is by, you know, maybe adding more layers.

894
01:27:57.700 --> 01:28:03.130
Anthony Taylor: maybe adding more neurons. you know, we already know, adding more features works.

895
01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:16.770
Anthony Taylor: And you can see. So this is every epic. It's changing the weights and trying to make it fit today. And that's this is what's happening. As

896
01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:22.960
Anthony Taylor: each of these executions are running first one, random weights. I have no idea what I'm looking at.

897
01:28:23.070 --> 01:28:36.699
Anthony Taylor: Second one. Okay? I saw it. I'm gonna make adjustments. more adjustments, more adjustments. Almost. There. Okay. My accuracy looks good, but I'm lute. But I'm still missing, predicted an actual

898
01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:38.860
Anthony Taylor: down to here.

899
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:41.189
Anthony Taylor: like really close.

900
01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:43.449
Sihong Zhou: like a violation.

901
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:48.410
Sihong Zhou: varies right between a prediction and a reality.

902
01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:54.959
Anthony Taylor: Well, yeah, I don't. I mean, it's it's actually, I believe it's outlighted with Mse.

903
01:28:56.270 --> 01:29:00.210
Sihong Zhou: Oh, no. We told it to use binary cross entropy. Yeah.

904
01:29:00.890 --> 01:29:06.289
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so it measures the dissimilarity between the predictive probabilities and the true binary labels.

905
01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:09.410
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

906
01:29:10.140 --> 01:29:12.049
Anthony Taylor: Hi, Natalie, question.

907
01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:35.469
Mason, Natalie: My question had to do with the history. Df, plot. Why, accuracy chart mine just looks different than yours. It's just 1.0 in the center of the chart, and it's just a straight line. So I just was curious how I want to see that.

908
01:29:35.690 --> 01:29:38.490
Mason, Natalie: Show me that that sounds totally different.

909
01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:43.819
Mason, Natalie: It is. It's just plotted different, like on the Y

910
01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:46.140
Mason, Natalie: access.

911
01:29:49.450 --> 01:29:56.069
Mason, Natalie: yeah. So go up that your date is wrong, is it? I didn't change anything

912
01:29:57.970 --> 01:29:58.890
Anthony Taylor: really.

913
01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:08.790
Mason, Natalie: No, not that far. I only change the color change the color. Rainbow is better than winter.

914
01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:13.670
Mason, Natalie: Okay. So here.

915
01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:16.549
Anthony Taylor: history. Df, floods

916
01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:19.779
Anthony Taylor: alright, show us again

917
01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:24.249
Anthony Taylor: just where you created the data frame. Yeah.

918
01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:32.449
Mason, Natalie: it's just plotted different. There's just different numbers. But sorry the data frame.

919
01:30:32.570 --> 01:30:34.119
Mason, Natalie: Oh, sorry. Sorry.

920
01:30:34.830 --> 01:30:36.020
Mason, Natalie: That's okay.

921
01:30:36.190 --> 01:30:43.309
Dipinto, Matt: If it started at a 10 accuracy on its first run, just based on purely random chance. It might make that.

922
01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.370
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I mean, run the do a restart and run all.

923
01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:49.600
Mason, Natalie: Okay.

924
01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:52.910
Anthony Taylor: let's see if it. Does it again.

925
01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:56.080
Anthony Taylor: Go ahead.

926
01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:59.270
Dipinto, Matt: You still have Pip, install tensorflow at the top cell.

927
01:30:59.450 --> 01:31:01.249
Mason, Natalie: Oh, is that? Gonna

928
01:31:01.770 --> 01:31:05.580
Anthony Taylor: no, I won't hurt anything. I mean, it'll take a minute

929
01:31:05.690 --> 01:31:06.890
Dipinto, Matt: nailed it. Test

930
01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:11.370
Anthony Taylor: still

931
01:31:11.860 --> 01:31:14.140
Dipinto, Matt: isn't out there yet.

932
01:31:14.370 --> 01:31:18.600
Anthony Taylor: Go back. Oh, it hasn't got here yet. Oh, yeah, you're right. Okay.

933
01:31:19.090 --> 01:31:22.130
Anthony Taylor: Sorry. I'm I'm used to a little quicker.

934
01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:27.670
Mason, Natalie: I'm out in the woods. It might take a minute.

935
01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:35.390
Anthony Taylor: I'm pretty sure that's gonna be the answer. In this case. If not.

936
01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:38.869
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. We'll have to look at the data. There you go.

937
01:31:39.670 --> 01:31:42.630
Anthony Taylor: Here you go. Awesome. Good call.

938
01:31:43.710 --> 01:31:46.400
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So

939
01:31:47.930 --> 01:31:50.089
Anthony Taylor: if there are no other questions.

940
01:31:53.110 --> 01:32:00.020
Anthony Taylor: we'll take our break. Hold on! Let me see. Want to make sure we're in the right place.

941
01:32:03.930 --> 01:32:04.660
Anthony Taylor: Yep.

942
01:32:04.850 --> 01:32:11.219
Anthony Taylor: Hi, guys, break time. Take 15. I'll see you. You know what? Yeah, I'll see you at 9,

943
01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:12.600
Anthony Taylor: 35.

944
01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:17.570
Anthony Taylor: Sorry, whatever your time is. 35 min after the out.

945
01:32:20.750 --> 01:32:21.730
Thank you. 5

946
01:32:22.150 --> 01:32:22.980
Anthony Taylor: or

947
01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:31.300
Anthony Taylor: you guys are, gonna do your own.

948
01:32:35.270 --> 01:32:40.269
Anthony Taylor: So do note, I mean, you're you should not behave one kid a hundred percent on this way.

949
01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:44.470
Anthony Taylor: Okay, look at that. That noise in there. That's a lot. So

950
01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:48.990
Anthony Taylor: anyway, basically follow what I did in the example

951
01:32:49.070 --> 01:32:59.010
Anthony Taylor: and throw it together. It's just going to be a neural network. So a single layer. and 50 epics

952
01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:12.830
Anthony Taylor: and then plot it out. Okay, I'm gonna give you 20 min to do this one. We will be sitting here wondering how you're doing so feel free to call. Well.

953
01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:19.419
Anthony Taylor: how did that go? Some came back rather early, so I'm assuming it wasn't too bad.

954
01:33:21.050 --> 01:33:24.050
Anthony Taylor: Everyone feel like you could make a neural network. Now.

955
01:33:27.470 --> 01:33:30.230
Anthony Taylor: alright! Well, let's take a look at that.

956
01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:38.540
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Our group takes advantage of the extra time to either further discuss and ask questions about the content or

957
01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:40.759
Meredith McCanse (she/her): talk about real-world situations.

958
01:33:40.850 --> 01:33:47.310
Anthony Taylor: You guys could come back me and come back in here and go. Let's talk about it. Ask questions and ask me questions.

959
01:33:47.770 --> 01:33:50.279
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Oh, that's a good idea. Okay.

960
01:33:50.980 --> 01:33:55.459
Anthony Taylor: let's come up with questions to ask Anthony, and and and he'll get him wrong.

961
01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:59.589
Anthony Taylor: I won't get wrong. I'll just say I'll get back to you on that.

962
01:33:59.730 --> 01:34:04.569
Anthony Taylor: That's my, that's my escape mechanism. like, let me look for that.

963
01:34:04.950 --> 01:34:05.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

964
01:34:06.190 --> 01:34:11.959
Anthony Taylor:  cause. Even though I've been doing this a long time, I don't know every single

965
01:34:12.850 --> 01:34:13.510
like.

966
01:34:15.650 --> 01:34:16.830
Anthony Taylor: I know you're disappointed.

967
01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:31.789
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we gotta get rid of our target column. We're gonna make our do our splits. the standard stuff we've done many times. Now. alright, let's bring in our new model.

968
01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:39.569
Anthony Taylor: Are you sharing? And no, II wasn't. I was trying to. Very descriptive with my work.

969
01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:49.779
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So up to here we were doing all the stuff we've done many, many times. Now we bring in our tensorflow model.

970
01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:59.040
Anthony Taylor: And we're going to get our input nodes by getting the length of our X, we're going to do a one layer with 5 neurons

971
01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:03.509
Anthony Taylor: and an input layer with, however, many input columns we have

972
01:35:05.330 --> 01:35:08.760
Anthony Taylor: is then sorry. Question.

973
01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:19.979
Kanouff, Christine:  can you explain again, what? What are the what is units equal? 5 like, where does that come from?

974
01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:22.639
Anthony Taylor: Do I have the picture upstairs? Yeah.

975
01:35:22.650 --> 01:35:28.020
Anthony Taylor: that's the first. So that that block of code. We just did the inputs.

976
01:35:28.050 --> 01:35:31.140
Anthony Taylor: we're 2 and neurons

977
01:35:31.170 --> 01:35:36.779
Anthony Taylor: or 5 like this, 1 6. But neurons were 5. So it'd be 5 of these little blue dots.

978
01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:39.329
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's what that first one said.

979
01:35:39.530 --> 01:35:45.910
Dipinto, Matt: It's 5. Just a good arbitrary starting point, like just a good number throw in there.

980
01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:51.579
Anthony Taylor: No, the actual rule of thumb is you want at least as many.

981
01:35:52.290 --> 01:35:55.090
First layer neurons is you have inputs. But

982
01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:57.660
Anthony Taylor: somebody might look at you funny if you have like a

983
01:35:57.780 --> 01:36:02.049
Anthony Taylor: a million pixel image, and you do a million nodes

984
01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:05.520
Anthony Taylor: right? But it's not unheard of. You could do it wouldn't hurt anything.

985
01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:06.760
Dipinto, Matt: You

986
01:36:07.110 --> 01:36:13.530
Anthony Taylor: yeah. But the rule of thumb is is, you usually want at least as many in the first layer as you have infants.

987
01:36:16.730 --> 01:36:21.960
Anthony Taylor: but it, like every other rule in these type situations. You can play around with that, though.

988
01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:30.009
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, yeah, so that's our input row. And then our output

989
01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:34.660
Anthony Taylor: is simply we have one possible output column.

990
01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:36.150
Anthony Taylor: and

991
01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:40.260
Anthony Taylor: that we're going to say we're gonna use the sigmoid.

992
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:45.319
Anthony Taylor: Think I'm a flop. And then we can look at our summary.

993
01:36:45.810 --> 01:36:48.479
Anthony Taylor: See? We have 2 layers, input

994
01:36:48.580 --> 01:36:52.730
Anthony Taylor: and the output pretty much. Here's our compile.

995
01:36:53.930 --> 01:36:54.960
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

996
01:36:55.330 --> 01:36:58.440
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to do 50 epics.

997
01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:03.830
Anthony Taylor: just a normal fit guys. There's nothing really special about it other than you have to tell it.

998
01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:06.510
Anthony Taylor: And then probably even that has a default

999
01:37:06.850 --> 01:37:08.150
Anthony Taylor: that shit does.

1000
01:37:13.330 --> 01:37:16.650
Anthony Taylor: When we're all done, we can do an evaluate.

1001
01:37:16.850 --> 01:37:22.480
Anthony Taylor: and we can see we've got a 13 lost 95. That's pretty good. That's pretty nice model.

1002
01:37:23.070 --> 01:37:29.280
Anthony Taylor: Alright, we can do the history and plot it can see we very quickly went up.

1003
01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:31.979
Anthony Taylor: and that's that

1004
01:37:33.050 --> 01:37:35.510
Anthony Taylor: not bad. Oh, Mike, question

1005
01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:40.840
michael mcpherson: binary cross entropy and optimizer atom.

1006
01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:49.520
Anthony Taylor: Yes, sir. so binary cross. And remember, I did mention earlier. You guys can feel free to look those up.

1007
01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:52.599
Anthony Taylor: But binary cross entropy

1008
01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:58.539
Anthony Taylor: it. It measures the dissimilarity between the predicted probabilities and the true binary labels.

1009
01:37:58.590 --> 01:38:04.090
Anthony Taylor: So that's this loss. And that's how we're calculating. There are

1010
01:38:04.100 --> 01:38:05.510
Anthony Taylor: a number

1011
01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:15.510
Anthony Taylor: of loss functions that you can use the optimizer, Adam. I don't have the definition in front of me, but not hard to find.

1012
01:38:16.770 --> 01:38:23.090
Anthony Taylor: Optimizer Adam is a stochastic. Here we go. This is the Jennifer definition moment. Probably.

1013
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:26.500
Anthony Taylor: Where is she? Is she? Here, there she is

1014
01:38:26.770 --> 01:38:31.230
Anthony Taylor: a stochastic, gradient, descent method that is based

1015
01:38:31.510 --> 01:38:34.359
Anthony Taylor: on the adaptive customization.

1016
01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:38.470
Anthony Taylor: First order and second order moments

1017
01:38:39.740 --> 01:38:42.219
Anthony Taylor: is that when that even falls in your area different?

1018
01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:44.700
Anthony Taylor: No, that was crazy.

1019
01:38:44.730 --> 01:38:47.899
Masarirambi, Rodney: Yeah. But it's called the ads. Think of words.

1020
01:38:48.770 --> 01:38:52.379
Anthony Taylor: I did not just pick those up, I swear. Look.

1021
01:38:57.980 --> 01:38:59.659
Anthony Taylor: I did not make that up

1022
01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:02.950
michael mcpherson: gradient descent.

1023
01:39:04.350 --> 01:39:06.780
michael mcpherson: Think I'm having a nice second break.

1024
01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:10.120
Baro, Sonja: having a second order order moment.

1025
01:39:11.910 --> 01:39:27.000
Anthony Taylor: So the reason why I tell you what's easier to do is like, go to chat Gp and ask it, or if you really want to know, the bottom line is is we are going to cover these a little bit when we get to 2.

1026
01:39:28.270 --> 01:39:36.619
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're gonna talk about like different reasons to use different ones. But we're really not gonna super. Define this. We're just gonna tell you

1027
01:39:36.710 --> 01:39:38.980
Anthony Taylor: when you may want to use this or when not to.

1028
01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:41.960
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But it's a good question

1029
01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:46.580
Anthony Taylor: it. It's one of those questions that every time I teach this I'm like, I gotta look this up.

1030
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:47.869
Anthony Taylor: cause I don't

1031
01:39:48.410 --> 01:39:53.090
Anthony Taylor:  But it's funny that you bring that up.

1032
01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:58.540
Anthony Taylor: and I want to say that. And but a bump move on to the next activity.

1033
01:39:58.980 --> 01:40:02.719
Anthony Taylor: Okay, let me see, I don't think I have any slideshow to go with this? Let me check.

1034
01:40:08.330 --> 01:40:09.730
Anthony Taylor: We did all the

1035
01:40:11.420 --> 01:40:12.800
Anthony Taylor: question.

1036
01:40:13.530 --> 01:40:19.640
Anthony Taylor: Bring your own questions. Nope, that's it. We'll recap. Okay.

1037
01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:23.100
Anthony Taylor: alright. So this last one's just a demonstration.

1038
01:40:23.130 --> 01:40:28.440
Anthony Taylor:  it's kind of weird.

1039
01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:36.690
Anthony Taylor:  I want to do it a little differently than they asked me to do it, just because I think the way they ask me to do it.

1040
01:40:38.050 --> 01:40:43.790
Anthony Taylor: So look at the one that says solution first, with binary classes solution.

1041
01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:50.519
Anthony Taylor: If you guys are following along. We're gonna bring in tensorflow. And now this is some real data. So this is the data set.

1042
01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:54.020
Anthony Taylor: Where they have 5 different

1043
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:56.950
Anthony Taylor: measurements. And

1044
01:40:58.180 --> 01:41:04.859
Anthony Taylor: the class is either oral or nasal. It has to do with like voice class.

1045
01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:07.570
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So it's like a, No, yeah, you know, whatever.

1046
01:41:08.050 --> 01:41:11.670
Anthony Taylor:  there's a problem with this one, though

1047
01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:16.650
Anthony Taylor: that isn't obvious. When you look at the head. Okay.

1048
01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:22.280
Anthony Taylor: it's got the values of one and 2. Now

1049
01:41:25.270 --> 01:41:30.280
Anthony Taylor: think about what I just said about binary cross entropy.

1050
01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:38.850
Anthony Taylor: What did I say? Anybody remember? If I remember, I'll read it one more time if you guys pick up on why this might be a problem

1051
01:41:39.050 --> 01:41:48.769
Anthony Taylor: commonly used for binary classification and measures. With this similarity between predicted probabil probabilities and true binary labels.

1052
01:41:51.420 --> 01:41:52.909
Anthony Taylor: do we see a problem here.

1053
01:41:55.140 --> 01:42:00.239
Anthony Taylor: One and 2 are not binary labels, are they? It's only 2 labels.

1054
01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:05.739
Anthony Taylor: But it's not a binary classification. Exactly. So I'm just pointing out

1055
01:42:06.870 --> 01:42:15.260
Anthony Taylor: 0 and one. So what we have to do is basically we're gonna change one of these into a 0.

1056
01:42:15.690 --> 01:42:33.649
Anthony Taylor: Well, and it's easier change the 2 to 0 and let the other one be one that gives us 0 to what? Okay? Now, I'm going to stop right here. We're going to come back to this. This is this is the thing they didn't they? They wanted this. The only difference between the training, real data solution and the with binary classes. Solution

1057
01:42:33.810 --> 01:42:35.489
Anthony Taylor: is what I just showed you.

1058
01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:40.260
Anthony Taylor:  So we run it. We run it.

1059
01:42:40.670 --> 01:42:43.890
Anthony Taylor: And we get this. It's like, okay. But notice.

1060
01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:46.810
Anthony Taylor: they didn't check this time.

1061
01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:50.569
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we run this.

1062
01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:54.660
Anthony Taylor: we bring in our model. We

1063
01:42:54.670 --> 01:43:02.179
Anthony Taylor: create our first layer, create our output layer. take a look, and I'll go through this slower in the other one

1064
01:43:03.150 --> 01:43:11.750
Anthony Taylor: binary cross entropy, and, Adam, that nothing is broken yet, has it?

1065
01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:19.130
Anthony Taylor: But once you guys notice something very strange.

1066
01:43:23.590 --> 01:43:26.530
Meredith McCanse (she/her): the loss gets really big negative numbers.

1067
01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:29.380
Anthony Taylor: huge negative numbers.

1068
01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:41.990
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so this is, it's funny. II was like trying to figure out how to explain this before before I figured out how to explain it. I threw it into chat. TV chat, TV team went dude. There's something wrong with your stuff.

1069
01:43:42.610 --> 01:43:51.149
Anthony Taylor: pretty much what it said. Right? It said, this is not normal. This is highly unusual. Somebody screwed up. Basically, that's what it said.

1070
01:43:51.550 --> 01:43:56.149
Anthony Taylor: so yeah. So if you see something like this, something's wrong.

1071
01:43:56.190 --> 01:43:57.289
Anthony Taylor: Go check it out.

1072
01:43:57.570 --> 01:44:00.900
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I'll stop there. We'll go back to the one that's working, probably.

1073
01:44:01.410 --> 01:44:14.580
Anthony Taylor: So since we changed it to 0 and one. Now, binary cross into people work to tell us loss. Okay, alright. So the rest of this thing we're gonna create our X

1074
01:44:14.610 --> 01:44:17.149
Anthony Taylor: by dropping flat. Create our Y

1075
01:44:17.190 --> 01:44:19.980
Anthony Taylor: with all stuff we've done before train tests split.

1076
01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:26.329
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna define our sequential neural network model.

1077
01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:34.689
Anthony Taylor: And then we're gonna get the link for input nodes and create our first layer. It'll be 5 neurons.

1078
01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:37.269
Anthony Taylor: And however, many inputs.

1079
01:44:38.350 --> 01:44:39.859
Anthony Taylor: which was what 5,

1080
01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:43.170
Anthony Taylor: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

1081
01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:49.499
Anthony Taylor:  just so you guys know. Remember, in

1082
01:44:49.590 --> 01:44:58.950
Anthony Taylor: Vs code, you can go variables. And you could come down here and look at input nodes. 5. Okay, this

1083
01:44:58.980 --> 01:45:00.899
Anthony Taylor: I always forget to.

1084
01:45:01.380 --> 01:45:05.410
Anthony Taylor: I just started getting better about my, the tool I use it. Work

1085
01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:08.220
Anthony Taylor: is notebooks, and it has that also.

1086
01:45:08.260 --> 01:45:16.160
Anthony Taylor: But it's relatively new. And so I just started using it more. And I'm like, Oh, it saves me so much time. anyway.

1087
01:45:16.460 --> 01:45:19.690
Anthony Taylor: okay. So we have our input layer with our inputs.

1088
01:45:19.850 --> 01:45:23.250
Anthony Taylor: And then we have our output layer with sigmoid.

1089
01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:26.169
Anthony Taylor: and we're going to do our summary.

1090
01:45:26.380 --> 01:45:29.210
Anthony Taylor: You can see 5 and one looking good

1091
01:45:29.410 --> 01:45:30.650
Anthony Taylor: compile.

1092
01:45:31.170 --> 01:45:34.030
Anthony Taylor: binary cross entropy, 100 epics.

1093
01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:36.820
Anthony Taylor: This one should look much better

1094
01:45:39.170 --> 01:45:42.330
Anthony Taylor: as far as the loss values.

1095
01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:50.340
Anthony Taylor: And

1096
01:45:54.090 --> 01:46:01.029
Anthony Taylor: okay, that's what it came up with after a hundred epics. So what are some ways we could improve this if we wanted to

1097
01:46:05.930 --> 01:46:06.950
Anthony Taylor: go, Meredith.

1098
01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:16.949
Meredith McCanse (she/her): You could play. We can't really increase the number of inputs because we have a set amount. But you could play with the number of nodes or try a different

1099
01:46:17.250 --> 01:46:22.299
Meredith McCanse (she/her): what's the right word? The release relu? Right? But there's different.

1100
01:46:22.890 --> 01:46:27.710
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Might make a difference. You could change the number of epics

1101
01:46:28.140 --> 01:46:29.250
Meredith McCanse (she/her): right?

1102
01:46:30.850 --> 01:46:38.909
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Right? Cause we didn't ever get down. We didn't ever get to one anywhere with the accuracy, so you could do more

1103
01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:44.420
Anthony Taylor: to. Now notice, though, as this is going

1104
01:46:46.150 --> 01:46:50.140
Anthony Taylor: over a hundred, it's really not getting much better.

1105
01:46:50.710 --> 01:46:57.660
Anthony Taylor: So this is one of those situations like, I told you guys, I mean, there is a point where the patterns just stop. Okay, maybe.

1106
01:46:58.130 --> 01:47:04.089
Anthony Taylor: So we got 81 35. I remember what we got for was like 70 35, wasn't it?

1107
01:47:05.690 --> 01:47:10.540
Baro, Sonja: That was close to 80, I thought. was it? Okay?

1108
01:47:10.650 --> 01:47:19.320
Anthony Taylor: Well, yeah, even at yeah. So that was definitely not worth changing. Okay.

1109
01:47:19.620 --> 01:47:25.860
Anthony Taylor: So the next thing would be. we would start adding layers. And we're not going to start adding layers till next class

1110
01:47:26.130 --> 01:47:35.640
Dipinto, Matt: emeritus question. So the input, data is, it's got negative value. So with something like a leaky relu or something else, perform better on

1111
01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:37.659
Dipinto, Matt: that, we could try it.

1112
01:47:37.850 --> 01:47:40.710
Anthony Taylor: Why not? Let's do it. Let's do. 10

1113
01:47:40.860 --> 01:47:50.270
Baro, Sonja: cause Relu takes the negative, wasn't. That's the one with the it's Y for any negative x equals 0. And then

1114
01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:52.760
Dipinto, Matt: and then you triangles. X on the

1115
01:47:54.530 --> 01:48:00.300
Anthony Taylor: oh, shoot. Okay. So one quick note, do you guys see what just happened there? Look at how many layers I have?

1116
01:48:01.290 --> 01:48:02.200
Baro, Sonja: Oh.

1117
01:48:02.530 --> 01:48:06.040
Anthony Taylor: okay, well, that's because we didn't reinitialize.

1118
01:48:06.380 --> 01:48:10.769
Anthony Taylor: Let's see if I just reinitialize the model that'll clean it up or do I have to reset it?

1119
01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:20.519
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, there we go. So I added 8 neurons, and I changed it to 10, because I know that'll go negative and positive. Let's see what we get with that

1120
01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:36.339
Anthony Taylor: about the same.

1121
01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:43.320
Anthony Taylor: So it might just be that this is an example where we need to add more layers to really get it to finally work.

1122
01:48:43.650 --> 01:48:52.019
Anthony Taylor: But but this is the cool thing. So this is, you know, guys same thing. As I told you with the other machine learning models. This is the science. This is the art

1123
01:48:52.520 --> 01:49:01.729
Anthony Taylor: of doing this good news is like Grid. Cv. I have something we'll call. That's something that will help us with neural networks like that.

1124
01:49:02.190 --> 01:49:05.450
Anthony Taylor: Okay, not grid. CD, but a different tuner

1125
01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:07.960
Anthony Taylor: capability that'll allow us to pass in

1126
01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.420
Anthony Taylor: lots of tuning at one time.

1127
01:49:10.490 --> 01:49:11.510
Anthony Taylor: Yes, ma'am.

1128
01:49:12.940 --> 01:49:18.279
Meredith McCanse (she/her): question about like one of the big things we did in our project was kind of figure out

1129
01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:27.819
Meredith McCanse (she/her): what were the biggest drivers of it. And then, like, kind of get rid of stuff that wasn't really comp contributing much to the model to sort of remove some noise.

1130
01:49:27.910 --> 01:49:36.930
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Is there a similar? Is there a way? And I know on the playground we looked at you had different levels of noise. Is there a way to figure out?

1131
01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:45.870
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Oh, right, is there a way to determine, like of the input that we put in there is any of it just kind of unnecessary noise that might be detracting from the

1132
01:49:46.010 --> 01:49:48.270
Meredith McCanse (she/her): effectiveness of the model.

1133
01:49:49.220 --> 01:49:56.330
Anthony Taylor: The the problem is is that was real data. So noise typically noise is not necessarily wrong.

1134
01:49:56.610 --> 01:50:08.750
Anthony Taylor: Noise in the in the tensorflow playground is, we're basically saying, instead of making it clean. Divisions, right? We're saying, make it look more like real data and have it mix up a little bit

1135
01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:10.430
Anthony Taylor: or have it overlap with them

1136
01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:14.419
Anthony Taylor: that just have some outliers that you, you know, would be

1137
01:50:14.490 --> 01:50:19.660
Anthony Taylor: yeah. So the tensorflow playground. It gives you very clean divisions, those nice.

1138
01:50:19.690 --> 01:50:24.649
Anthony Taylor: perfect spirals, even though they were complicated, they were perfectly lined up. That's something

1139
01:50:25.180 --> 01:50:26.680
Anthony Taylor: right. That's unlikely to

1140
01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:33.610
Anthony Taylor:  So by adding noise through dots all over the place. So that's not going to change

1141
01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.630
Anthony Taylor: you. You could there be more pre-processing we could do.

1142
01:50:40.020 --> 01:50:49.430
Anthony Taylor: There's not a lot unless you like plotted this out and found it's like heavily skewed or something along the live. This data here would probably not be

1143
01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:51.020
Anthony Taylor: heavily skewed

1144
01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:53.099
unless it's like.

1145
01:50:53.250 --> 01:50:59.060
Anthony Taylor: you know, 80% is ones, and 20% is twos, maybe.

1146
01:50:59.490 --> 01:51:03.179
Anthony Taylor: But as far as the data itself, running standard scalar.

1147
01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:10.820
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, III what you'll learn next class will do deep learning, which just means we're gonna add more layers

1148
01:51:11.140 --> 01:51:13.980
Anthony Taylor: between adding layers and adding neurons.

1149
01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:21.669
Anthony Taylor: You're almost certainly gonna get a better score than than this. But it is possible that there's so

1150
01:51:22.010 --> 01:51:24.769
Anthony Taylor: they're just so overlapped. You never get a perfect school.

1151
01:51:25.250 --> 01:51:26.360
Anthony Taylor: which is okay.

1152
01:51:26.890 --> 01:51:31.970
Anthony Taylor: right? I mean. But if there was a possibility of getting a perfect score you'd get it with a girl number.

1153
01:51:32.990 --> 01:51:40.640
Anthony Taylor: Okay, even the neural networks that we're going to talk about next week that are more complicated. All they do is

1154
01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:48.950
Anthony Taylor: what they're doing is they just break the data into smaller pieces or effectively like, get a result, go back and do it again.

1155
01:51:49.860 --> 01:52:00.050
Anthony Taylor: So they're they're. I want to say, recumbent and convolutional. Okay. we're going to get into that. But those are more for visual

1156
01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:07.260
Anthony Taylor: right. They're more for like vision, because vision has, you know, huge number of of inputs

1157
01:52:07.410 --> 01:52:11.949
Anthony Taylor: trying to process, you know, a billion inputs all at once. Very difficult.

1158
01:52:11.970 --> 01:52:20.119
Anthony Taylor: So why don't we process a little block. Here, little Buck. Here, little buck here, little buck here, and just do that through the whole thing, and then process those

1159
01:52:20.290 --> 01:52:32.070
Anthony Taylor: blacks of pixels, you know, instead of the whole freaking thing. Right? They're very computationally expensive. All of this neural network stuff. Everything we're going to cover

1160
01:52:32.890 --> 01:52:38.529
Anthony Taylor: almost to the end of class is very computationally expensive. But guys.

1161
01:52:40.110 --> 01:52:41.979
Anthony Taylor: CPU is not expensive. And

1162
01:52:43.290 --> 01:52:49.539
Anthony Taylor: okay. storage is not expensive anymore. You won't be able to necessarily do it on your laptop.

1163
01:52:49.640 --> 01:53:03.100
Anthony Taylor: But you know, getting a grid, you know, a grid of computers for an hour. You know, it's not that expensive, especially to an organization that's gonna want you to run. You know, a long training neural network.

1164
01:53:03.690 --> 01:53:07.350
Anthony Taylor: They're gonna be like, Oh, okay, it's a few 100 bucks. Okay. Go ahead.

1165
01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:11.570
Anthony Taylor: you know. Now, if you wanted to do it every hour.

1166
01:53:14.650 --> 01:53:15.580
Anthony Taylor: anyway.

1167
01:53:17.580 --> 01:53:20.800
Anthony Taylor: So that's it. That's all I really have for today.

1168
01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:27.330
Anthony Taylor: Tomorrow 3 is Wednesday, yeah. tomorrow.

1169
01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:38.859
Anthony Taylor: What are we gonna do. We're gonna do some more crazy ones. We're gonna do some boosting and some optimization and some tuning.

1170
01:53:40.270 --> 01:53:48.039
Anthony Taylor: It's interesting at some point. I guess when we do. we have to get into deep learning at some point. So I'm assuming that'll be

1171
01:53:48.330 --> 01:53:54.379
Anthony Taylor: yeah. So the first one we're gonna do is we're gonna actually do a multi layer model which will make it deep learning.

1172
01:53:54.610 --> 01:53:58.860
Anthony Taylor: And then we'll get into some optimization kind of stuff.

1173
01:53:59.790 --> 01:54:10.980
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Exciting. I hope you guys enjoy neural networks. They're very exciting for us as data scientists and AI professions.

1174
01:54:11.780 --> 01:54:15.280
Anthony Taylor: This is what made us amazing.

1175
01:54:16.950 --> 01:54:22.659
Anthony Taylor: Alright, have a wonderful night guys. I will see you tomorrow. We'll be here for 30 min for office hours.
