1
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.310
Anthony Taylor: Let's get started. Let's get started, cause we want to get started. It's the day

2
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.130
Anthony Taylor: it's the day

3
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.090
Anthony Taylor: James or Kevin. When do you guys want to set up the rooms

4
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:27.000
Anthony Taylor: for the groups? Okay, so I gotta tell ya been through a lot of excitement today over this project stuff.

5
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.800
Anthony Taylor: the

6
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.590
stage, so

7
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:45.210
Anthony Taylor: there were no instructions. Let's just put it that way alright. It told you what you were going to be graded on. There were no instructions. You're supposed to do

8
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.289
Anthony Taylor:  curriculum team. And I went back and forth on this for hours today.

9
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.830
Anthony Taylor: Finally I got permission to just make them myself. So we have a slide show.

10
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:09.349
Anthony Taylor: You'll be able to tell which slides I made because they don't fit the rest of the theme. Alright. Okay. So today is Project one.

11
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.269
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna start today with listing the requirements. That's what was missing.

12
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.769
Anthony Taylor: And then we're gonna describe the purpose. Yeah, we'll get that.

13
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I have a few gifts for you.

14
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:27.580
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we've already divided into teams. We already know what our teams are. We talked about that day. We can move right off past that

15
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.810
Anthony Taylor: introduction. Here we go. Anthony slides

16
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.790
Anthony Taylor: first. You need to choose a project topic. Now I will tell you.

17
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.170
Anthony Taylor: Then I am going to give all of you

18
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:56.380
Anthony Taylor: this chattypt generated document I did years ago. Well. this year, E. Until I did the 1,305 who maybe I should do it again in 4.0. Anyway.

19
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.070
Anthony Taylor:  prompt was simple.

20
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.840
Anthony Taylor: But what it gives us

21
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.490
Anthony Taylor: is a whole bunch of free data sets.

22
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:13.220
Anthony Taylor: That you guys can use if you choose to come up with project Ids.

23
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay, in the old days, the way we did this is we said.

24
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.970
Anthony Taylor: come up with an idea and go find data was horrid.

25
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.640
Anthony Taylor: right? And I explained to them that never happens in real world.

26
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.509
Anthony Taylor: Okay, in the real world. You are given data and a task.

27
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:39.929
Anthony Taylor: So I'm not gonna go as far as give you data, because then I think that's forcing you and not letting you be a richer.

28
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.589
Anthony Taylor: But I will give you that list of I ideas and you're going to love it

29
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.499
Anthony Taylor: are probably, or you can find your own.

30
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:58.890
Anthony Taylor: Okay? The cool thing about that list also is, if you look at the links, Kaggle Uci.

31
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.649
Anthony Taylor:  most of them are cattle in Uci.

32
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:13.949
Anthony Taylor: You'll see these are plate. These are great places to get additional data. Obviously, census data we talked about at 1 point.

33
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.269
Anthony Taylor: That's a big one. So anyway. So pick a topic that's treat your group and as relevance real world.

34
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:29.129
Anthony Taylor: I don't really feel strongly about relevance real world. If you want to do something silly. Do something silly. Okay, it's okay. Yes, ma'am.

35
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.739
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Do we need to stay in the in the

36
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:44.210
Meredith McCanse (she/her): what's it called canvas or the boot camp module on the overview. It talks about like using staying within 3 categories, either finance or healthcare or

37
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.480
Anthony Taylor: other.

38
00:03:45.760 --> 00:04:00.869
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Oh, I guess you never mind so kind of whatever. Forget it. We're gonna cover those 2. Don't worry. Got it. Okay? So feasibility, this is probably the most important thing today. As you guys come up with your topic. That's your main goal today, and I will get into that.

39
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.290
Well.

40
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.069
Anthony Taylor: actually, maybe we won't. So this is me telling you your main goal today will be to pick a topic, find date.

41
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.219
Anthony Taylor: You'll have approximately 2 and a half hours to do so.

42
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.760
Anthony Taylor: Okay,

43
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.109
Anthony Taylor: right? Alright. So you wanna make sure you can get this done

44
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.960
Anthony Taylor: within the 2 week time.

45
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.590
Anthony Taylor: and do keep in mind while it says 2 weeks.

46
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.079
Anthony Taylor: Forget the fact that you have a big holiday in the middle the last day of that few weeks you really won't get much time to work.

47
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.810
Anthony Taylor: That's mostly presentations that

48
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:36.540
alright.

49
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:45.360
Anthony Taylor: So today. Also, you need to. I mean, so these are all the things that this project is meant to teach you managing your teams.

50
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.790
Anthony Taylor: You don't need a project manager. But you guys as a team need to assign roles.

51
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:58.789
Anthony Taylor: you need to, you know. And and I mean, in some of the things like someone does data, collection, analysis, visualizations, documentation.

52
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:12.590
Anthony Taylor: I've had groups where they had one person just did the whole presentation. That's it. Not speaking it. But you know, writing it out. Okay? And then other people decode, or whatever you guys can break it up any way you'd like.

53
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:21.430
Anthony Taylor: just because if you get a non-coding role doesn't mean you should ignore the coding. but it means you don't have to code in this project.

54
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.389
Anthony Taylor: So if you don't want a non-coding role, make sure you tell your group.

55
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:27.810
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

56
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.760
Anthony Taylor: You don't have to do from slack channel, but it is very helpful

57
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.919
Anthony Taylor: to have your own slack channel.

58
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.110
Anthony Taylor: Alright!

59
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:47.230
Anthony Taylor: To talk to each other regular meetings, because this project you have the big break in the middle. I would say, you probably are. Gonna have time to do this last time.

60
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.610
Anthony Taylor: But if you choose to meet outside a class more power to. Okay.

61
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.919
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Hmm. so project planning. So first

62
00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.259
Anthony Taylor: break your project down into smaller tasks. Okay, we're gonna get into some of those tasks in a minute.

63
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.530
Anthony Taylor: Alright, like data collection, cleaning exploratory analysis.

64
00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.630
Anthony Taylor: creating the project, etc.

65
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:19.069
Anthony Taylor: Define the internal deadlines for each phase to ensure your making progress. You don't need to do milestones and gant charts for my pns.

66
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.610
Anthony Taylor: Alright. But at least say, Hey.

67
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:28.650
Anthony Taylor: we really need to have the data loaded by before prisons. Well, which is what

68
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.650
Anthony Taylor: one more class, I don't think that's going to work.

69
00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:37.650
Anthony Taylor: But, you know, like, right at the beginning, right? When we get back, need to have data loaded. Maybe some initial analysis.

70
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.170
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

71
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:48.319
Anthony Taylor:  try to get good data. Here's some other suggestions. Nasdaq, Federal reserve. Again, census kaggle

72
00:06:48.790 --> 00:07:00.620
Anthony Taylor: so here's the steps cleaning the data once you get it, whether you use an Api, whether you use the download and upload whatever you need to do to get it. Get it.

73
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.620
Anthony Taylor: Okay. cleaning it.

74
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.489
Anthony Taylor: You will need to have some cleaning. Now.

75
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:20.299
Anthony Taylor: part of the problem with the cleaning step in this project is more times than not. Waiting. Downloading is already clean. Okay, you're not getting data from work. You're getting data from somebody who has date.

76
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:26.470
Anthony Taylor: So if that cleaning could be something as simple as lowering the number of columns.

77
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.879
Anthony Taylor: changing the numeric data types into numbers instead of strings.

78
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:37.839
Anthony Taylor: Stuff like that don't get too worked up about it. Just realize if there is a cleaning step, be sure to document.

79
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.130
Anthony Taylor: Yes, I'm

80
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:46.310
Baro, Sonja: is it alright to have multiple sources for different types, like, if we're looking at?

81
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:50.359
Baro, Sonja: Okay, I was gonna say, market size, that kind of stuff. Okay.

82
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:57.629
Anthony Taylor: you, you probably should expect. Well, it just depends. Like, if you did something on a titanic data set right?

83
00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you probably not gonna get more data set alright. But if you do something on

84
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:09.620
Anthony Taylor:  Boston Boston housing data set, and you want to bring census in.

85
00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.070
Anthony Taylor: that would be a great combination. Okay. Stuff like that.

86
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:20.530
Anthony Taylor:  census is. The cool thing about sentencing is census is one that works with so many topics.

87
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:26.760
Anthony Taylor: But it's kind of hard work. Alright. So keep them. Remember that when we went over

88
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.819
Anthony Taylor: alright, eat a

89
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:34.110
Anthony Taylor: need to understand your data, start with basic statistics. This is the stuff we talked about

90
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:35.500
Anthony Taylor: correlations.

91
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.329
Anthony Taylor: Okay, is my sample. Any good?

92
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.290
Anthony Taylor: All right. Stuff like that. Do you have to show that? Do you have to do that? No.

93
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:53.040
Anthony Taylor: okay. But this is what we mean by eda visualizations to understand how your data is distributed?

94
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:58.240
Anthony Taylor: Okay, is there a positive correlation negative? Is there no correlation?

95
00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:01.559
Anthony Taylor: Well, how is it skewed? Is it normal distribution

96
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.720
Anthony Taylor: that it

97
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:07.760
Anthony Taylor: trends in your data again, back to correlations

98
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:12.390
Anthony Taylor: and anomalies can play around with the box plots? If you really want to.

99
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.000
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

100
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:20.839
Anthony Taylor: so this is Eda portion. This is really what this whole project is.

101
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:28.280
Anthony Taylor: Alright, I don't really expect a lot of like. Oh, we came to the conclusion that blah blah blah blah!

102
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:34.069
Anthony Taylor: Yes, you will come to a conclusion based on the analysis you did on your data.

103
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:42.330
Anthony Taylor: But you don't really have enough other things to support it haven't been taught enough of that yet. So at this point, the main goal is the

104
00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.340
Anthony Taylor: of doing your analysis. Okay.

105
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:53.839
Anthony Taylor: so based on your initial findings, form a hypothesis. Guide to deeper knowledge. I will tell you. We used to like, teach

106
00:09:54.510 --> 00:10:02.319
Anthony Taylor: hypothesis, null hypothesis to all of this stuff. We don't do that anymore. So here's what I want you to remember about formal hypotheses.

107
00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:06.149
Anthony Taylor: Look at the data and ask and come up with questions.

108
00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.100
Anthony Taylor: I don't know if we talk about questions.

109
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:12.649
Anthony Taylor: I don't think so. So come up with 3 4 questions

110
00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:17.220
Anthony Taylor: and then use visualizations to answer the question.

111
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:26.330
Anthony Taylor: Okay. something like, again using Boston housing and census is, is Boston housing?

112
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:32.990
Anthony Taylor:  prices going up in areas where poverty rates very high?

113
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

114
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:43.910
Anthony Taylor: I want yeah, and and you would form it like a question. I wonder if Boston or you know, is bus house rates going up? We're poverty reach high.

115
00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:50.960
Anthony Taylor: That's it. So come up with 3 or 4 questions. That's what I'm talking about with hypothesis, for.

116
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:56.259
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we could do the null hypothesis and my statistic people, Jennifer

117
00:10:56.290 --> 00:11:00.270
Anthony Taylor: and anybody else could go. Oh, well, the no hypothesis, that is.

118
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:03.260
Anthony Taylor: and we would have no problem with it. But it's also a horrible lecture.

119
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:10.060
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So apply relevant. So this is the we're not. Gonna you know what I should doubt.

120
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.929
Anthony Taylor: Well, no, I should put this slide out.

121
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.329
Anthony Taylor: But you can

122
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:22.709
Anthony Taylor: answer your questions with statistical techniques. So the correlation regression.

123
00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:36.159
Anthony Taylor: time series analysis because you have profit. I would love to see everybody use profit somewhere. You don't have to. It's not required. Create a clear and important, then the visualization. But you should have

124
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:47.940
Anthony Taylor: 2 to 3 visualizations per question. So let's do the math here you should have 2 to 3 questions. and 2 to 3 visualizations per question.

125
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.480
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

126
00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:59.029
Anthony Taylor: Now, okay. Now, some of this. Now see, I don't really care about this that much, so I would love to see it

127
00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:05.090
Anthony Taylor: the grading. So the way I built this, by the way, I use Chat Tbt, of course.

128
00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:13.240
Anthony Taylor: I created my own GPT. Called data Professor. It's very cool. this guy right here. and

129
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.559
Anthony Taylor: his whole. I actually gave him all my entire brain

130
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:19.520
Anthony Taylor: and said.

131
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:30.770
Anthony Taylor: Be a date. So I just, I gave them basically the scoring criteria for this project. Instead, come up with instructions on how to tell students how to use how to do it.

132
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.100
Anthony Taylor: And it came up with all of this. It's freaking amazing.

133
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:35.360
Anthony Taylor: Okay, anyway.

134
00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:38.539
Anthony Taylor: So coding documentation is graded.

135
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:49.139
Anthony Taylor: So comment. Your code. it is part of the great may not be very big, but it's part of the great your findings.

136
00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:57.959
Anthony Taylor: don't remember if the rubric says they have to be in the read me, but if you do a slideshow, we'll make sure. And you include your findings.

137
00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.669
Anthony Taylor: You're covered.

138
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:05.130
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And you should do a site. So I don't care if you use Google sites, Powerpoint whatever.

139
00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:17.230
Anthony Taylor: And Google slides, probably easiest cause. It's easy for us to great. Okay, remember, this isn't going to the graders. This is just a the 3 of us alright.

140
00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:26.500
Anthony Taylor: So preparing for the presentation. So again II will tell you. I didn't even realize this presentation is 30 points.

141
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:31.310
Anthony Taylor: I am the only person grading the presentation.

142
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.970
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you need to present as this.

143
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:39.339
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So,

144
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:40.780
Anthony Taylor: you're telling the story.

145
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:43.480
Anthony Taylor: This is the story

146
00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:55.199
Anthony Taylor: of how we decided, look at this data. And we came up with with these questions that it'd be way more exciting than that. But

147
00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:58.540
Anthony Taylor: you know we we came up with these questions, and

148
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:05.289
Anthony Taylor: how many of you saw the the example I showed in class of not very many of you stayed for that.

149
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.290
Anthony Taylor: That's a shame. It was very much like.

150
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.990
Anthony Taylor: but it was amazing.

151
00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.620
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

152
00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:17.559
Anthony Taylor:  I suppose I could share it.

153
00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:27.289
Anthony Taylor: anyway. yeah. So a story. how you started, what you did?

154
00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.809
Anthony Taylor: I don't care about your code. What did you do?

155
00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:41.599
Anthony Taylor: We cleansed our code. We had dirt. What what does that mean? Cleanse your code? But I had. We had columns that were strings, but they were actually dates, so we formatted them as dates. Great.

156
00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:46.390
Anthony Taylor: Did you run into any problems with that? Yeah, when we did it, the date format was really weird.

157
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:50.420
Anthony Taylor: Hey? I don't wanna have to ask those questions. This is what you need to tell me.

158
00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:59.229
Anthony Taylor: Okay, rehearsal. The good news is, we don't have a lot of groups. It's a small class. Last class.

159
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:03.450
Anthony Taylor: You will have time to rehearse. You only get 10 min.

160
00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.319
Anthony Taylor: So if I give you an hour and a half on the last class, you can go through it.

161
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:14.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay. before you come and show it to us. Okay.

162
00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:17.369
Anthony Taylor: Github is required. Just okay.

163
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.379
Anthony Taylor: Get up as required.

164
00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:26.210
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So you will get today. You will create a get master. First thing, they will create a project

165
00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.069
Anthony Taylor: and share it with all of you

166
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:31.330
Anthony Taylor: in your group.

167
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:34.610
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then each of you.

168
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.649
Anthony Taylor: we talked about branches right?

169
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:39.569
Anthony Taylor: And get, I'm pretty sure we did

170
00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:43.199
Anthony Taylor: no curry. But okay, Natalie said, Yeah.

171
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.630
Anthony Taylor: Curry Gabe.

172
00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:57.789
Anthony Taylor: Okay, good. Jennifer. Okay, good. Alright. So create a quick branch for each of you. Don't try to work in the main. As you finish, push the stuff that you want in the main into the main

173
00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:01.360
Anthony Taylor: Maine is what we grade, not your branches.

174
00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:03.480
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

175
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:12.029
Dipinto, Matt: So, Anthony, one thing we I don't think covered is. So we talked about how to like merge. Well, we didn't talk about how to merge, especially with multiple contributors.

176
00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:19.390
Dipinto, Matt: And obviously, that's something we could research on our own. But do you think it would be worth.

177
00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:31.130
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's what I'm gonna tell Matt. And here's how not to do what Matt just said. Don't name your files the same thing. Everybody put your initials on your on your, on your code.

178
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:39.010
Anthony Taylor: So like, if you're gonna do a notebook. Natalie, NM. Dash data, cleansing notebook.

179
00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:55.009
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that way. When you do merge, Matt, cause I I can tell you we've tried to teach like my conflict resolution and get you think you guys get irritated with me now when we get into hard topics that will try people crazy.

180
00:16:55.410 --> 00:17:09.690
Anthony Taylor: Okay, And I'm the get master at my company. So I'm well aware of what it takes. But I just it's just very hard to explain. So my recommendation to every project every student has ever done in my boot, Kit.

181
00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:11.820
Anthony Taylor: just try not to name the thing.

182
00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:18.309
Anthony Taylor: And with that statement, Matt, you're gonna love this. every single project, every single boot camp.

183
00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:20.540
Anthony Taylor: There has been at least one group

184
00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:24.200
Anthony Taylor: that we had to say, Okay, just delete the entire

185
00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:35.850
Anthony Taylor: repo, copy the files, delete the repo, make a new one, put the files back in. happens every single time, every single time. cause they just get so out of whack, there's no fixed.

186
00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.749
Curry Gardner: So you're saying, that's not normally how you're supposed to do it.

187
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.020
Anthony Taylor: What with the initials?

188
00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:43.609
Curry Gardner: No, you're not.

189
00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:47.920
Anthony Taylor: Curry's clearly worked with, you know, before.

190
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.070
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, yeah, I've done this a couple of times.

191
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:58.939
Anthony Taylor: have you, Mike? Oh, with your rep, with your homework. Yeah. Well, wait till you do it with 4 other people adding to it.

192
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:01.230
Anthony Taylor: it'll be fun.

193
00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:06.850
Anthony Taylor: Okay, Matt, I do have a lecture. I really want to see it. But

194
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.309
Anthony Taylor: in fact, it's usually given today.

195
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:15.910
Dipinto, Matt: Matt really really wants it and wants I love lecture. I think everyone should.

196
00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:21.099
Anthony Taylor: It's usually given in in the data class. We give it today.

197
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:27.110
Anthony Taylor: First day of project. We give the whole github like you've never used it before it's crazy.

198
00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:37.549
Anthony Taylor: anyway. Let's keep going. So utilize your resources. What does that mean? Tutors learning assistance? Your instructional team, chat Tpp.

199
00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:39.980
Anthony Taylor: the canvas assistant.

200
00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.239
Anthony Taylor: I mean each other.

201
00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:50.610
Anthony Taylor: Your friend that knows programming. I don't care. This is a project. You can do it. Don't let them do the work for you.

202
00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:55.740
Anthony Taylor: but if you need help, get help specially over the holiday.

203
00:18:55.820 --> 00:19:00.910
Anthony Taylor: Yes, I will see. Slack. And yes, I may answer. but I may not.

204
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:12.930
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So you have enough resources. I guarantee it that you can find what you're looking for. Alright. peer review.

205
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:25.180
Anthony Taylor: I mean, you guys do this a lot within slack which I really appreciate right where you guys say, Oh, I'm stuck. And then somebody comes in and looks at what you're doing. That's awesome. And that's what Peer Review is

206
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:27.970
Anthony Taylor: okay, we. So I still do this today.

207
00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:41.429
Anthony Taylor: If I'm stuck, I will call the only other guy in the company. That's that that knows what I'm doing, and I'll say, Dude, just look at this with me for a few minutes, 9 times out of 10, while I'm explaining it to all my figure it out. But

208
00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.590
Anthony Taylor: just that moment of let me explain what I'm trying to do.

209
00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:58.890
Anthony Taylor: That makes the day okay. Alright tips for success again. All this was done by Chat T. Vt, is this not ridiculous? Stay curious.

210
00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.830
Anthony Taylor: Ask why, even looking at your data

211
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:13.150
Anthony Taylor: don't just come up with one question. Maybe that question leads to others. You don't need 20 questions. Don't overwhelm yourself. But maybe those other questions will be more interesting than the one started.

212
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:19.110
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And and by interesting. I don't mean interesting to me. Don't try to impress me.

213
00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:26.370
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I want it to be fun for you. So come up with questions that interest you.

214
00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:32.640
Anthony Taylor: Okay, embrace mistakes. Oh, my God! If we could say this, every single challenge

215
00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:42.790
Anthony Taylor: I gonna make em. They're going to take time to fix good news, is, there's 3 or 4 of you working together so hopefully won't take as long as normal.

216
00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:44.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

217
00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:49.410
Anthony Taylor: But when you're working, there's gonna be problems. You're gonna struggle.

218
00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.570
Anthony Taylor: It's okay. That's part of the the thing.

219
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.300
Anthony Taylor: It's part of the journey.

220
00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.529
Anthony Taylor: This project is as much about

221
00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:09.500
Anthony Taylor: getting to Presentation Day as presentations. Presentation day is just what we're grading. What you're learning is that journey

222
00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:14.149
Anthony Taylor: alright presentation day. You're not learning any.

223
00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:20.520
Anthony Taylor: They're learning that Anthony can look serious for 10 min and not speak.

224
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.679
Anthony Taylor: Okay. that's it.

225
00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:37.459
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Okay. So enjoy working with team learning. Remember, this project is not just about analyzing data. It's about working effectively as a team managing a project, driving insights that potentially make a real world impact.

226
00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:43.170
Anthony Taylor: Again. if you want to do like basketball stats, that's fine.

227
00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.460
Anthony Taylor: it's not going to affect anything, anything in the world. But

228
00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:52.140
Anthony Taylor: whatever. So dive in explore. And most importantly.

229
00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:55.540
Anthony Taylor: have fun with this.

230
00:21:56.170 --> 00:22:01.979
Anthony Taylor: it's serious. It's important. but it doesn't have to be unpleasant.

231
00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.200
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's kind of life.

232
00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:08.050
Anthony Taylor: That's that's my theme for the whole boot camp.

233
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:13.909
Anthony Taylor: It's serious. It's important. But it doesn't really need to be unpleasant.

234
00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:16.900
Anthony Taylor: Okay. alright.

235
00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:24.339
Anthony Taylor: That was, that was my addition. So I want you to realize that the rest of this is what I was supposed to give

236
00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:26.680
Anthony Taylor: choosing a track.

237
00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:32.549
Anthony Taylor: finance, healthcare custom. These are examples. Okay? So Edi and finance

238
00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:37.729
Anthony Taylor: identifying deals, private equity, arbitrage, opportunity, liquidity.

239
00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.100
Anthony Taylor: liquidity.

240
00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:43.980
Anthony Taylor: finance, refinance trends. How many of my finance people are in here. Let's see

241
00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:45.260
Anthony Taylor: 2.

242
00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:48.050
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, that's what I thought.

243
00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.780
Anthony Taylor: So they actually know what all that stuff means.

244
00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:58.310
Anthony Taylor: All right. The rest of us are going. Is that booze? I don't know right, anyway.

245
00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:07.289
Anthony Taylor: Investment, banking professionals, private. These are people who use this private equity analyst lending analysts, finance administrators, real estate professionals

246
00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:10.670
Anthony Taylor: cool. If you're interested in it, go for it.

247
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:14.570
Anthony Taylor: More examples like actual. Eva.

248
00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:19.839
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so while working for a large equity training company, you're tasked with researching a client's portfolio.

249
00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:28.119
Anthony Taylor: They want to invest in telecom stocks and need expert analysis to make the right decision. So you use Nasdaq data, pull a year's worth.

250
00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:32.409
Anthony Taylor: Major telephone providers at TT. Mobile, Verizon.

251
00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:38.579
Anthony Taylor: which stocks are trading upward, which are trending down from the data. What recommendations would you make the client.

252
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.710
Anthony Taylor: This is an Eda process.

253
00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:45.769
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So if you take all those steps I gave you.

254
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:52.120
Anthony Taylor: apply it to this, this first question. you're done. You got it? Okay?

255
00:23:52.220 --> 00:24:02.970
Anthony Taylor: New car analysis people have been financing higher car values over a longer amount of time. What is driving this search for answers using data collected from the FRED.

256
00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.110
Anthony Taylor: What do your results suggest about time value of money

257
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.390
Anthony Taylor: healthcare.

258
00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:15.990
Anthony Taylor: This is for my nurses and healthcare people. That's what Sonia. Me.

259
00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.760
Anthony Taylor: who else is healthcare in you.

260
00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:21.550
Anthony Taylor: Natalie Jennifer? Oh, we got quite a few of

261
00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:29.680
Anthony Taylor: so clinical data and analysts. Pharmaceuticals, testing healthcare economics. senior policy, analyst,

Anthony Taylor: appliance, operation, analyst, public health information scientist.

263
00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:40.410
Anthony Taylor: So all of these things absolutely do it. Also. Most large medical companies have an it department

264
00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.180
Anthony Taylor: who are feeding

265
00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:55.249
Anthony Taylor: ports and analysis to management all the time. Okay, why is it important? Predicting diagnoses and illnesses? Greater accuracy improves patient safety, improves, diagnoses

266
00:24:55.450 --> 00:25:09.169
Anthony Taylor: greater understanding of risks and causes and prevention strategies. Okay. example. People working in tech are often at their desk for extended amounts dying. How does this correlate with one's mental health.

267
00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:17.849
Anthony Taylor: Examine the data collected through surveys and search for trends. Do keep in mind. You will not have time to make a survey

268
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.619
Anthony Taylor: if the data's not already out there. Don't try to do it. So make sense.

269
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:31.849
Anthony Taylor: You're not gonna have time to do any significant survey. That's gonna give you an update in the matter. What do the results show you about the prevalence of mental health in tech?

270
00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.080
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

271
00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:40.439
Anthony Taylor: Personal fitness. Analyst is working out how a person become more active overall.

272
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:47.589
Anthony Taylor: And this is, you know, they're used data collected by Samsung health applications which I do believe that's available on tackle.

273
00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:51.059
Anthony Taylor: What do the results tell you about individuals using the app

274
00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.290
Anthony Taylor: interesting.

275
00:25:54.320 --> 00:26:01.490
Anthony Taylor: So just Eda in general. Yes, it is used by anybody using data, which is anybody that actually makes money

276
00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:05.130
Anthony Taylor: except for professional athletes and actors.

277
00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:13.500
Anthony Taylor: And they use data, too. statistics all the time. So I guess that wasn't an accurate statement.

278
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:16.099
Anthony Taylor: I don't think they make charts.

279
00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:18.750
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

280
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:28.359
Anthony Taylor: So other professions, natural and environmentalist scientists, marketing professionals, information security analysts, business intelligence analysts.

281
00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:30.809
Anthony Taylor: I think we've covered everybody at this point.

282
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:35.810
Anthony Taylor: Private investigator, we have any. Private investigators

283
00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:44.099
Anthony Taylor: use aggregate crime data from different police precincts in the city to uncover patterns of criminal activity.

284
00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:49.129
Anthony Taylor: Most crime in New York City takes place in the summer.

285
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:53.770
Anthony Taylor: That's because the criminals don't steal coats

286
00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:57.070
Anthony Taylor: right?

287
00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:03.559
Anthony Taylor: What do your reserves suggest about how police should plan their patrols?

288
00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:13.970
Anthony Taylor: Uber rides? No one likes to walk in subzero temperatures or scorching heat. Do people use uber more when their when the weather is uncomfortable?

289
00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.640
Anthony Taylor: Probably

290
00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:20.960
Anthony Taylor: okay. And we can look at it. And this definitely is in Kaggle.

291
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:22.980
Anthony Taylor: Aye.

292
00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.000
Anthony Taylor: project 2.

293
00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.480
Anthony Taylor: Break. It's not break time. Don't even think.

294
00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:39.099
Anthony Taylor: Anthony, did you say we could get the rubric as well or no. The rubric doesn't. They know. Okay, hold on. Let me fine.

295
00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:42.570
Anthony Taylor: They they don't do rubrics anymore, I was told.

296
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:50.350
Anthony Taylor: Okay, like, Oh, we know 30 points is the presentation right? But I, yeah, I have. I have.

297
00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:52.950
Anthony Taylor: And and it's in canvas somewhere.

298
00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:56.680
Anthony Taylor:  but I will give you what I have.

299
00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:05.670
Baro, Sonja: Is that my direct us a little bit? Not just

300
00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:09.029
Anthony Taylor: that lecture. But let me find.

301
00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.869
Anthony Taylor: yeah, I've been working with this this person

302
00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:15.200
Anthony Taylor: all day.

303
00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:19.720
michael mcpherson: isn't it? In the module section?

304
00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:21.770
Anthony Taylor: It could be.

305
00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:25.090
Raugewitz, Tania: It is

306
00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:28.129
Anthony Taylor: oh, good. So you guys see the scoring?

307
00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:33.839
Anthony Taylor: Yes, I think this is Project One.

308
00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.850
Anthony Taylor: Is this, it is this what it looks like in yours?

309
00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:41.999
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Yeah. keep going. Okay. So if you go all the way down.

310
00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:45.259
Anthony Taylor: there's the requirements.

311
00:28:46.650 --> 00:29:01.219
Anthony Taylor: So get is 10 points. Documentation is 10 points. See? They're saying, Read me. I will. I want you to do a read me, but I will accept the Powerpoint, for, like your your final solution.

312
00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:08.240
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But do a read me that at least lists like, who's in your group and what your topic was.

313
00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:13.699
Anthony Taylor:  so this is the important part. This in the presentation.

314
00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:21.339
Anthony Taylor: Okay? 6. Take visuals, at least 2 per question. We talked about that.

315
00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:29.479
Anthony Taylor: Be sure to describe what each visual is actually showing.

316
00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.609
Anthony Taylor: or what you're trying to show.

317
00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:36.370
Anthony Taylor: Alright. And then last the presentation. So

318
00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:38.080
a

319
00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.830
Anthony Taylor: yep. and that's it. Okay.

320
00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:54.470
Anthony Taylor: So there's some more places you can get data. So this is all in your canvas.

321
00:29:56.690 --> 00:30:05.920
Anthony Taylor: Were you also going to share with us the lists that you had of the topics with the yeah, you wishes. That's great. Everybody gets excited about that.

322
00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:11.510
Anthony Taylor: So before I do that, are any other questions.

323
00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:21.610
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I have a question. So the did you say, the go. The main goal today is to choose

324
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:24.139
Meredith McCanse (she/her): a topic and find our data

325
00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:28.609
Meredith McCanse (she/her): as far as long as you can.

326
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:33.050
Anthony Taylor: But but yeah, I mean hopefully. By the end of today

327
00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:35.440
Anthony Taylor: you will at least have that.

328
00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.899
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay? And then tomorrow will probably be beautiful.

329
00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:48.419
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay? And then tomorrow, like, find thinking of the question, the hypothesis questions that we want to, or narrowing in on the hypothesis questions.

330
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:51.989
Anthony Taylor: Well, you probably would start reading in the data as

331
00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:00.810
Baro, Sonja: I was. Just suggest. Also, I need to think about how to approach the overall timeline like

332
00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:05.649
Baro, Sonja: to what you just said yeah, today.

333
00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:12.510
Baro, Sonja: how we're gonna work together, figuring out the timeline. And then once we have that timeline, then everything flows from that.

334
00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:22.540
Anthony Taylor: So remember, like the stuff I just gave you is a bunch of websites with data, Kaggle, Uci, etc. But remember, all Apis are available to you too.

335
00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:29.960
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So you have a tremendous amount of data. Do keep in mind, not all data is free.

336
00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:34.099
Anthony Taylor: So make sure you can get the data, and it is free

337
00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:47.330
Anthony Taylor: whenever you start alright. So again. So let's let's here, let me break down today for you. You're gonna all say, Hi. you're gonna create a Github repository.

338
00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:56.520
Anthony Taylor: You're gonna come up with a group name. Actually, let's change that you're gonna say, Hi. go up with a group name, create a Github Repository that matches your group name.

339
00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:00.340
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And

340
00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:07.450
Anthony Taylor: then discuss topics. Come up with a short list. Look for data.

341
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:17.169
Anthony Taylor: Now, if you're using the form I gave you, you can look at that. You already have some data and the topic. So that'll go fast. But

342
00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:25.129
Anthony Taylor: I'm fine. If you guys have other ideas. I know, Natalie. She's a music person. Maybe their group wants to do music. Spotify has some great stuff out there.

343
00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:28.660
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I don't know. Totally up to you guys.

344
00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:31.300
Anthony Taylor: Okay. a.

345
00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:40.080
Anthony Taylor: yeah. So if you can get if you guys have data, or at least a plan on how to retrieve your data. By the end of today

346
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:46.250
Anthony Taylor: you're doing great. If you have it by the end of tomorrow. You're still doing pretty. Dob gone. Good.

347
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:48.420
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

348
00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:56.199
Anthony Taylor: But you definitely want it by want to have all of your data in cleansed by the third day of class.

349
00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:58.370
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

350
00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:05.159
Anthony Taylor: Cause then that gives you 2 more days to do visualizations and presentation.

351
00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:07.460
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

352
00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.820
Anthony Taylor: But remember, you got a big giant breaking

353
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:14.270
Anthony Taylor: which is going to be weird.

354
00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:18.339
Anthony Taylor: Alright, any other questions before I send you away.

355

366
00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:17.440

367
00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:20.810
Anthony Taylor: Alright, so that might.

368
