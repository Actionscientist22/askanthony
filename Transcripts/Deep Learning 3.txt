1
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.770
Anthony Taylor: I

2
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:16.060
Anthony Taylor: welcome to day 3 of deep learning. Week, 2 of boot camp.

3
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.980
Anthony Taylor: What would you do?

4
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:23.570
Not that

5
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.459
Meredith McCanse (she/her):  Your sound is cutting in and out a little bit, Anthony.

6
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.750
Anthony Taylor: Really.

7
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.390
Dipinto, Matt: I think it's only because, being loud it anytime, you're like yelling things loudly. Your Mike gets a little spotty, so

8
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.389
Anthony Taylor: alright, so hopefully, that doesn't happen.

9
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.629
Baro, Sonja: I feel bad. If that ever that's making me laugh again.

10
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.480
Anthony Taylor: I do have like a really fancy, like podcast Mike.

11
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.929
Anthony Taylor: that I don't plug in

12
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.699
Anthony Taylor: because it feels too pretentious. Thank God, nobody here has one of those

13
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.760
Baro, Sonja: you don't want. The Britney Spears concert like

14
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.410
Anthony Taylor: I used to. You know what's funny. I used to wear that

15
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.240
Anthony Taylor: when I taught in person.

16
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.950
Anthony Taylor: and the reason is because we also recorded the class when I taught in person.

17
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.250
Baro, Sonja: But

18
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.630
Anthony Taylor: I you don't realize this about me. I do not sit still

19
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:27.750
Anthony Taylor: ever

20
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:44.219
Anthony Taylor: you get a Kevin. Remember, I'm all over the classroom. I will be right next to you asking you questions. I'll be everywhere all over the whiteboard. I love using white. And and so, because of that, my, my sound and my portings were always bad. So I just thought

21
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.580
Anthony Taylor: a wireless headset microphone that I would just wear

22
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.210
Anthony Taylor: while I taught class.

23
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.710
Anthony Taylor: So there's a bit of trivia way back, when

24
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.140
Anthony Taylor: seems like everything in my life is way back.

25
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:12.310
Anthony Taylor: I don't know why that is okay. So let's get started. Today's an interesting. a bit of excitement. We're gonna talk about branching and neural networks.

26
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.620
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna apply it to a neural network.

27
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.509
Anthony Taylor: We're going to understand the implications of Softmax.

28
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:35.429
Anthony Taylor: We've been using sigmoid as an output activation function. We're gonna use one called Softmax. Today, we're going to use softmax. And then we're gonna apply branching and softmax in a Cnm for image classification.

29
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.360
Anthony Taylor: That's our objectives.

30
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.340
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so what are we talking about?

31
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:52.009
Anthony Taylor:  so far, we have mostly done classifications that were relatively simple.

32
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.090
Anthony Taylor: By that, I mean, we have like a class, and maybe there's.

33
00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.920
Anthony Taylor: you know, 10 different options

34
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.070
Anthony Taylor: for that class. But it affected. But for the most part, we haven't done anything where the Y variable

35
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.770
Anthony Taylor: could be more than one column.

36
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:20.159
Anthony Taylor: Okay. for example. Actually, we might have some. I don't think they really?

37
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.450
Anthony Taylor: Well.

38
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.350
Anthony Taylor: for example.

39
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.570
Anthony Taylor:  see what these are

40
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.340
Anthony Taylor: any good at all for, what we're trying to talk about.

41
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.040
Anthony Taylor: I can use their example, but I'm trying to see if I want to use a different one. Hold on.

42
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.069
Anthony Taylor: So a news article.

43
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.050
Anthony Taylor: About the net worth of social media influencer. Okay.

44
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.219
Anthony Taylor:  what 2 categories, or what categories could that article show up in?

45
00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:08.579
Anthony Taylor: I mean, if you were trying to classify it? Well, it it could be a lifestyle piece. It could be an entertainment piece, because it's a social media influencer could be a business piece

46
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.239
Anthony Taylor: because we're talking about their, you know, their net worth.

47
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So the same

48
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.430
Anthony Taylor: features

49
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.760
Anthony Taylor: can give us more than one answer.

50
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:30.360
Anthony Taylor:  same thing. If you're like looking at Netflix shows, I mean, do Netflix shows have one category.

51
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.300
Anthony Taylor: Nay.

52
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.960
Anthony Taylor: right? Irreverent, quirky, witty

53
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.560
Anthony Taylor: comedy.

54
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.639
Anthony Taylor: Okay, all of these things are different

55
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.760
Clayton Graves: categories. You can have the same movie show up in different

56
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:58.289
Anthony Taylor: classifications, absolutely. And that's and that's really what we're looking at here. Same thing. So here, like, say, you're searching for? A pair of running shoes?

57
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.340
Anthony Taylor: Okay, can a pair running.

58
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.789
Anthony Taylor: Can I have a a. a row of of features

59
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.070
Anthony Taylor: that describe a black running shoot?

60
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.590
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I have a row. Features that describe. It's just a shoe.

61
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.170
Anthony Taylor: Yep, how about just a running shoot?

62
00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.939
Anthony Taylor: Yep, what about a trail running? Shoot? Yep.

63
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.549
Anthony Taylor: So all of these things are separate classifications. But one

64
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:39.669
Anthony Taylor: set of features. So we have not done this yet. Every Y label we've looked at so far has been one column. There are lots of classifications

65
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:47.800
Anthony Taylor: within that one column that we could do. We know how to do that right. But what we haven't done is

66
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:55.079
Anthony Taylor: what if a row of data gives us more than one type classification. And the key here

67
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.589
Anthony Taylor: is that you can have one without the other.

68
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.409
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so like. if if you had 2 classifications.

69
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.470
Anthony Taylor: that only made sense together.

70
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.720
Anthony Taylor: I'm trying to think of some. I mean.

71
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.430
Anthony Taylor: like, maybe Running Shoe.

72
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.929
Anthony Taylor: Okay, versus running and shoe as a separate thing. Running by itself is simply.

73
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.050
Anthony Taylor: you know, it may not necessarily be a classification, though it is a classification of a type shoe.

74
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:40.389
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but I don't know if that's the best example. But it's it's you understand, where I'm going with this right is that you have? If you have 2 columns that are describing something, and you couldn't pull one out by itself

75
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.869
Anthony Taylor: and say, Oh, well, it's just, you know this.

76
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.630
Anthony Taylor: okay.

77
00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:58.130
Anthony Taylor: and that wouldn't make sense. But when you put them together they make sense. That is not what we're talking about. What we're talking about is that. And and let's use the first one as an example for the news story.

78
00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.110
Anthony Taylor: It is an entertainment story.

79
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.119
Anthony Taylor: It is also a business story.

80
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.999
Anthony Taylor: So either one will work without the other.

81
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay, mutually exclusive.

82
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.930
Anthony Taylor: Okay, okay.

83
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:27.030
Clayton Graves:  So let me ask this if you were to come up with a classification for

84
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.429
Clayton Graves: for for the news article?

85
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.750
Clayton Graves: It could could it be either entertainment or business.

86
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:38.880
Clayton Graves: or entertainment and business? Or would it just be entertainment and business?

87
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:57.140
Anthony Taylor: And that's that's it's perfect that you ask that question, because that's exactly what I'm saying. If you can put an or between it, then that's what we're talking about today, if it's an and so they both have to be there, then that's really a situation where you would pre process the data and put those 2 in the same problem.

88
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:15.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Cause you would want to say entertainment slash business as one column, if it's an and if it's an or that's what we're talking about today. Okay, we're saying, Hey, this could be this or this. So what's that gonna mean? Well, ultimately, that's gonna mean, we're gonna have more than one y variable

89
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.599
Anthony Taylor: right? Y has been our predictive column every single time. Well.

90
00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.120
Anthony Taylor: for the first time, we're gonna have more than one.

91
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:27.880
Anthony Taylor: Okay, let's talk about another example. Let's say we have

92
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:32.020
Anthony Taylor: all of these columns, and they're they're explaining a fruit.

93
00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:36.600
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but we want to predict the type of fruit.

94
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:49.960
Anthony Taylor: the color of the fruit. and the ripeness of the fruit. Now all of the columns together have all of that information. So any one of them

95
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:57.209
Anthony Taylor: could give us the answer we're looking for. So now we could absolutely create a neural network

96
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:01.490
Anthony Taylor: that we put all of the data through and say, Give me the type of fruit

97
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:04.800
Anthony Taylor: and be done alright.

98
00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.040
Anthony Taylor: Then another neural network. Take the same data.

99
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.099
Anthony Taylor: Tell me how ripe this rule is.

100
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:17.169
Anthony Taylor: And then another neural network. Take the same data. Tell me what color this fruit should be, and maybe switch those up. But still.

101
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.910
Anthony Taylor: okay, what we're going to do today is we're going to talk about how to avoid that.

102
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:28.910
Anthony Taylor: because this isn't that uncommon for us to run into this. So

103
00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.749
Anthony Taylor: here's a cool example.

104
00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:44.480
Anthony Taylor: We're going to say, input layer. We're going to take all the features that are going to come in. We're going to have a hidden layer, a hidden layer. maybe. And this is very maybe alright. By by this. Okay.

105
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:52.900
Anthony Taylor: Will have an output of just the fruit type. Maybe we'll have another hidden layer. Maybe we'll just have another output.

106
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:59.709
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then the same thing for the third category we're looking for.

107
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:05.699
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you could have another human layer. We're like, Hey, you know what? We can get this fruit type with just

108
00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:18.800
Anthony Taylor: these layers. But we need another layer to get out color, and another layer to get brightness, or we find that, hey? We could do this with like 3 layers and get all 3 outputs, but they would still be a separate output for each one

109
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:23.780
Anthony Taylor: alright. And that output could.

110
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:30.330
Anthony Taylor: Is that where is this? So we can get into sigmoid? Yep, so that output output could absolutely

111
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:43.019
Anthony Taylor: have a different activation function. Alright. So another thing to remember. And and and this you'll see when we start coding. This

112
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.089
Anthony Taylor: is is this sequential?

113
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:56.509
Anthony Taylor: Not anymore. Is it everything we've done with neural networks thus far has been sequential, and I realize you could argue that that you know the

114
00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:04.769
Anthony Taylor: the the Cnn's were maybe not because they were going back and forth to back and forth. but they were still using sequential mechanisms.

115
00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.849
Anthony Taylor: Okay, these are not alright.

116
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:10.130
Clayton Graves: As we

117
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.399
Clayton Graves: is. This more and indicative of

118
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:23.390
Clayton Graves: standard practice like you would never branch the first hidden layer, or is that? No, you could absolutely. If that's enough, it's the same.

119
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.849
Anthony Taylor: All of the same principles. Apply

120
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:30.819
Anthony Taylor: that as they do to a neural network. If you could do it in one layer. That's better than doing it for

121
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:39.180
Anthony Taylor: right. But yeah, it's still gonna be faster to do it. I mean, you're still gonna have multiple outputs which are, gonna be separate layers.

122
00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:42.310
Anthony Taylor: But then but you might have only one hit.

123
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:56.659
Anthony Taylor: That's that's not unbelievable. I will say, since we're not using sequential. We'll actually build the layers out ourselves. And we're gonna crack up a little bit. That sounds awful. It's really not. It's it's actually pretty simple.

124
00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:14.990
Anthony Taylor:  okay? So each network will have a separate output layer and they'll have their own activation function. So the type of activation functions that are important are is, is whether they all depend on whether the the output is mutually exclusive

125
00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.720
Anthony Taylor: or independent.

126
00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:21.699
Anthony Taylor: or I shouldn't read it that way, mutually exclusive or independent, not like they're too different.

127
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:27.809
Clayton Graves: Okay, it's almost like this concept is.

128
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:40.089
Clayton Graves: And I know that this is kind of a broad stroke. But it's almost the same kind of concept is is nesting loops or investing dictionaries, or, you know, nesting one of those

129
00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.189
Anthony Taylor: see? And and I would say.

130
00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:49.270
Anthony Taylor: the convolutional stuff was more like nesting groups. This, to me, is more like reusing logic.

131
00:12:49.910 --> 00:13:05.679
Anthony Taylor: Right? I'm I'm already, since I've already processed the data through these 2 hidden layers. And it's. And and it's the same data for all 3 classes. I'm basically saying, I'm going to continue to use this work I did here, and just add a little bit more.

132
00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.450
Anthony Taylor: and I get this, and then a little bit more, and I get this

133
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.490
Anthony Taylor: right.

134
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:16.909
Anthony Taylor: that's I mean, like I said, the the loop and the 4 next that definitely describes the convolutional stuff.

135
00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:20.269
Anthony Taylor: But for this it's more like reusing processes.

136
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:34.050
Clayton Graves: Get branches out from

137
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:39.799
Clayton Graves: branching out, and then you get the second output from that one, and then you branch again. That makes sense. Got it.

138
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:49.089
Anthony Taylor: So okay, so the type of so it is, if it. If it is only possible for an output to be part of one class.

139
00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:54.179
Anthony Taylor: the output is mutually exclusive. So, for example, a fruit is either ripe or not.

140
00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.440
Anthony Taylor: Oh, yes, I'm

141
00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:09.920
Baro, Sonja: trying to unmute myself. Sorry I got confused, though, when you said that this is not sequential.

142
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.370
Baro, Sonja: because not sequential.

143
00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.169
Baro, Sonja: So cause we're brand new. That's up.

144
00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:21.080
Baro, Sonja: So Branch isn't considered a sequence. cause it can end right here.

145
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:26.029
Anthony Taylor: You see this. So yeah, so this this network could end right here.

146
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:35.520
Anthony Taylor: but because we have a branch, it can continue. And the main reason it's it's they. They make a big deal out of it when they say it, and the way I said it, II should have.

147
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:49.370
Anthony Taylor: I should have been a little less emphatic about it, because the reality is is all that they're really trying to say, there is when we import the library, we're not gonna use the sequential library that builds the model for us.

148
00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:55.570
Anthony Taylor: Right? We're gonna actually build that model out that that's what they were really trying.

149
00:14:55.610 --> 00:15:12.960
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, yeah, they they got kind of excited about, okay. So for example, fruit is either ripe or not. Okay, and it's mutually. This is a mutually exclusive binary classification. We already know what activation function to use for binary classification. Don't

150
00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:16.450
Anthony Taylor: sigmoid. I saw sign your mouth and it was going to be reversible.

151
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:25.649
Anthony Taylor: Okay, absolutely. A fruit can be either an apple, a banana, or an orange in this model

152
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:32.880
Anthony Taylor: is. This is a mutually, and this is mutually exclusive, but it is also multi-class.

153
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:35.750
Anthony Taylor: which for that we're going to use

154
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:38.699
Anthony Taylor: a new one called Softmax.

155
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:40.550
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

156
00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:48.600
Anthony Taylor: It is possible for an output to be part of one, both or neither.

157
00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.440
Anthony Taylor: That would be an output that is independent.

158
00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:58.189
Anthony Taylor: For example, think back to the example of black trail running shoes on the e-commerce site. Right?

159
00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:08.859
Anthony Taylor: imagine, if we had a Cnn that predicted how relevant product in the product database would be in your search product, maybe a black shoe, but also a lace up shoe.

160
00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:13.090
Anthony Taylor: It may be a running shoe, but not suited for trail running.

161
00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:17.210
Anthony Taylor: It may be a trail running shoe, but yellow

162
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:29.990
Anthony Taylor: or pink fashion, you will not relevant your search at all. In this case the output is independent, because the product could meet 1, 2, or all 3 of these criteria, or it could meet none of them

163
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:31.440
Anthony Taylor: you follow.

164
00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:34.729
Anthony Taylor: So if I say

165
00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:46.480
Anthony Taylor: well, let's let's change the model we have here. So here we're doing fruit type, fruit, color, fruit, ripeness. Well, what if we didn't say fruit? What if we said, anything that grows

166
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.940
Anthony Taylor: any produce.

167
00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So

168
00:16:51.980 --> 00:17:00.870
Anthony Taylor: you know. Then maybe we could say, Well. you know, it's well. No, I guess no fruit is also a vegetable. So that's not gonna work

169
00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:07.559
Clayton Graves: trying to think of a good example. I mean, the shoe example works fruit, vegetable or not. I mean, yeah, that's that's

170
00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:14.429
Anthony Taylor: well, that's multi-class, but that's not necessarily independent. What what I'm looking for is

171
00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:21.759
Anthony Taylor: well, I mean, you could possibly argue that you can have a green apple, a red apple, a yellow apple.

172
00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:28.680
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So that would then make that independent thing not mutually exclusive

173
00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.450
Anthony Taylor: when you compare color to type.

174
00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.449
Anthony Taylor: Okay,

175
00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:40.900
Anthony Taylor: so sigmoid for binary as, and and also for independent

176
00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:52.130
Anthony Taylor: softmax, is used to predict outputs that are mutually exclusive. you will get a probability of which one of these mutually exclusive items

177
00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:57.379
Anthony Taylor: is, you know, it is. So if it's 80% chance, it's a banana.

178
00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:00.439
Anthony Taylor: 20% chance. It's a zucchini.

179
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.300
Anthony Taylor: Okay, something like that

180
00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:04.500
Anthony Taylor: alright.

181
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:13.319
Anthony Taylor: But we have multiple things to predict, such as with branch network, it's possible that there are multiple sets of mutually exclusive and

182
00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.210
Anthony Taylor: independent outputs.

183
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:18.939
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Just keep that in mind. You can have both in one that

184
00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.929
Anthony Taylor: okay, first activity.

185
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:36.270
Anthony Taylor: This is not a go away activity. You're all gonna stay here. You're gonna answer out loud. okay, so the defe the decision to know which activation function is quite important.

186
00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:43.840
Anthony Taylor: So let's consider the following scenarios and discuss whether it's a softmax or a sigmoid.

187
00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:46.230
Anthony Taylor: I don't. Oh, I think I do. Okay.

188
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.470
Anthony Taylor: alright. First one.

189
00:18:50.570 --> 00:19:05.980
Anthony Taylor: a Cnn is created to predict whether an image has one vegetable or multiple vegetables, and whether the vegetables are green or red. these labels are in 4 columns, one vegetable, multiple vegetables, red and green.

190
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:12.500
Anthony Taylor: If these columns are predicted using a single layer which activation function should be used.

191
00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:20.790
Clayton Graves: I'm going to guess softmax because

192
00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:26.740
Clayton Graves:  it's it's not. It doesn't seem binary.

193
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:38.290
Clayton Graves: It seems like you're gonna need to branch to get this done. I know I know it, said only one layer, but if you have one, a hidden layer you can branch off from that right.

194
00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.570
Clayton Graves: And still

195
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:43.970
Clayton Graves: that's my guess.

196
00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.579
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Good! Guess alright, sign it.

197
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:52.519
Baro, Sonja: see? And I would have thought one or many is a binary choice.

198
00:19:53.310 --> 00:20:03.950
Baro, Sonja: So I can pick one or right. So there's only 2 values. The multiple vegetables isn't 2, 3, 4, 5. It's just 2 or more.

199
00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:09.779
Baro, Sonja: So I would have thought, that's binary. I thought about that. But when you start adding color.

200
00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.929
Clayton Graves: that's when I'm like, okay, maybe it needs to branch.

201
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:18.080
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so let me throw this out. There wouldn't color be an independent

202
00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.169
Anthony Taylor: variable in this case.

203
00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:25.250
Baro, Sonja: No. 7, and update

204
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:34.879
Anthony Taylor: it would. Oh, yeah, because you could have red one. You could have red, multiple green, one green.

205
00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:39.289
Anthony Taylor: In this case you would probably, and usually you will use Sig. What?

206
00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:43.500
Anthony Taylor: Because it is, it will go because they're independent, each one. It'll be rated that way.

207
00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:52.600
Anthony Taylor: Alright, alright! You would use it because it's independent and a single layer. You would use sigmoid for this.

208
00:20:53.890 --> 00:21:01.889
Baro, Sonja: So in that case, it sounds like it's the independence kind of is like the important. A lot of it is. Yeah, because we're not trying to get

209
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.150
Anthony Taylor: like a

210
00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:10.609
Anthony Taylor: none of those things. The other thing is is while you can have one vegetable and it's red.

211
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:14.549
Anthony Taylor: one vegetable. And it's green multi class.

212
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:17.279
Anthony Taylor: red, multi-class green.

213
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:23.349
Anthony Taylor: you would not necessarily have any of those, or all of those could be independent of the other.

214
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.699
Anthony Taylor: You could have red, you could have green. You could have one. You could have bank.

215
00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:39.700
Anthony Taylor: Okay? All right. Next one.  a neural network too far, a neural network is created to evaluate whether an item online will sell more

216
00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:43.559
Anthony Taylor: fewer or the same number of units next month.

217
00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.059
Anthony Taylor: Each potential outcome has its own column.

218
00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:55.010
Clayton Graves: So at this point each one of those is going to be exclusive. I don't think you could have an item

219
00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.959
Clayton Graves: belong to more than one

220
00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:02.949
Clayton Graves: column. In this case you're either gonna sell more, fewer or the same.

221
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.970
Clayton Graves: So I would say, signal

222
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:14.269
Anthony Taylor: the the other way. If you have mutually exclusive, then you want soft mix. I'm still kind of dependent. You want Sigma, that's okay.

223
00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:18.640
Anthony Taylor: That's okay. Mutually exclusive. Multiclass means soft bends.

224
00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:22.309
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Let's click to the answer.

225
00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:28.289
Anthony Taylor: So faded in. That's exactly the sound. It makes

226
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:43.660
Anthony Taylor: all right. Scenario 3. A neural network is designed to predict which group of flowers belongs to species A, B, or C, or large petal variants. Any species.

227
00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:49.569
Anthony Taylor: If these 4 columns are predicted using one layer, which activation

228
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:51.589
Anthony Taylor: should they use?

229
00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:01.880
Clayton Graves: Okay, so a flower can belong to both species, A and

230
00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:07.149
Clayton Graves: and large petal variant. Yes, it's only using one layer.

231
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.789
Clayton Graves: I gotta say, Softman, one layer is, gonna be the key

232
00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:19.459
Anthony Taylor: on this. It's just. And, to be honest with you I would prefer, they said, one call.

233
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:23.219
Anthony Taylor: Okay. If I said one column, would it make more sense?

234
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:25.949
Clayton Graves: Yes, Jennifer agrees.

235
00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:37.250
Anthony Taylor: Right. One column. This is definitely this is the thing, even though it is possible that an A, A B or C can also be a large Federal variant, because it's in one column.

236
00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:42.030
Anthony Taylor: right. It can't be. They're not. Yeah. It's it's

237
00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:45.560
Anthony Taylor: it's just it can't. So it Sig wide

238
00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:57.650
Anthony Taylor: works beautifully here. So I have completely flunked the first activity. Everybody give me a runner. That's okay, you know, and I was kind of I had to change it to slideshow.

239
00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.310
Anthony Taylor: because I realized it was giving answer down here at the time.

240
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:04.840
Anthony Taylor: Insight?

241
00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.250
Anthony Taylor: Oh, well, darn it.

242
00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:11.430
Anthony Taylor: yeah. So a

243
00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:17.790
Anthony Taylor: alright alright. So bottom line is is

244
00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:28.200
Anthony Taylor: a lot of the time. If you have more than one target, variable or label variable. It's probably going to be softmax. But if I mean, if you have

245
00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:32.599
Anthony Taylor: more than yeah, more than one if you have multi-class.

246
00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:37.720
Anthony Taylor: you know where you have just one and is multi-class. That's definitely signal.

247
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:45.590
Anthony Taylor: you know. I'm not gonna say Softmax.

248
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:49.329
Clayton Graves: More than one column in the output. It's probably

249
00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:59.539
Anthony Taylor: I mean the output variable itself can still be a sigmoid or a soft match. Right? So the output layer remember? Well, up until now we've only done.

250
00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:05.550
Anthony Taylor: But if you can have, like. like in the example, apple, orange, or banana.

251
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:14.609
Anthony Taylor: okay, in in the single output that could that could be a soft box, cause you're guessing the probability. It's one of those 3.

252
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:21.810
Clayton Graves: Could you have a hidden layer that is Softmax that branches to another hidden layer. That is sigmoid.

253
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.720
Clayton Graves: I suppose you could, but I don't know that that would work out well for you.

254
00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:32.959
Anthony Taylor: You probably want to keep with like Relu, or one of the other activations for that.

255
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:36.260
Anthony Taylor: Typically you're not going to do soft bat sigmoid inside.

256
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:39.160
Anthony Taylor: But you could. I mean, you could try it.

257
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.880
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

258
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.590
Anthony Taylor: so let's go build one of these things.

259
00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:50.499
Anthony Taylor: Now, I'm gonna be honest with you guys. it's best to go ahead and use coab today.

260
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:04.120
Anthony Taylor: Huh?

261
00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:06.730
Anthony Taylor: How many times you go make me sign in. Okay, there we go.

262
00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.460
Anthony Taylor: So go ahead and

263
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:17.469
Anthony Taylor: upload browse you. These do work on your local. By the way, all except the last.

264
00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.720
Anthony Taylor: And I'm gonna be honest with you guys.

265
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:23.530
Anthony Taylor: I probably could solve the last one figured out why it didn't work.

266
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:28.780
Anthony Taylor: But the heck out of me that it didn't work.

267
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:32.479
Anthony Taylor: and I was just like forget it.

268
00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:37.100
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So, Anthony, are you on exercise, too? Then the branch.

269
00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:48.660
Anthony Taylor: the everyone, Duke, or don't do your solved. even though I'm going to end up pasting a lot of the info into slack that you could just get off of your

270
00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:51.080
Anthony Taylor: solved version.

271
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:56.569
Anthony Taylor: But let's go ahead and work through it. Alright, like we're like, we're

272
00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.060
Anthony Taylor: gonna have some fun with this. Okay.

273
00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:04.549
Anthony Taylor: alright, otherwise we'll be done at like, you know, 80'clock, and everybody will be bad.

274
00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:09.460
Anthony Taylor: Okay. it's Mike's like, not me

275
00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.150
Anthony Taylor: alright. So we're gonna get ourselves.

276
00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:21.880
Anthony Taylor: Gotta get all this, we're gonna bring in some wine data and take a quick peek at it once everything gets installed.

277
00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:32.000
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and this is an interesting one. Now, here's what's fun about this data? Look at the end down.

278
00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:37.810
Anthony Taylor: Now. We could try to guess just the color

279
00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:43.149
Anthony Taylor: we could try to just just quality. But what if we wanted to get what if we needed to predict

280
00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:44.850
Anthony Taylor: both of these items?

281
00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:51.680
Anthony Taylor: Right? I mean, that's seems reasonable.

282
00:27:52.520 --> 00:28:00.430
Anthony Taylor: So if we're going to predict both of these items. Then basically, all we have to do is preprocess the data

283
00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:02.830
Anthony Taylor: or both columns.

284
00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:07.280
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we'll do one. We'll call it quality encoder.

285
00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:14.910
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna just encode it. So we're just gonna do our normal one hot coating. Okay.

286
00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:19.370
and we'll use sparse outputs.

287
00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:24.520
Anthony Taylor: Keep it. Keep it cleaner.

288
00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:37.069
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so that'll give us quality encoder. Now we need, you know, now that we have it, let's go ahead and fit, transform it. So we'll say quality encoded.

289
00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:50.120
Anthony Taylor: So here's where we're gonna actually do our fits. So use our quality encoder that we just made dot fit underscore transform

290
00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:55.009
Anthony Taylor: and pass in our quality data. So df.

291
00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.960
Anthony Taylor: 2 squares quality.

292
00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.060
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

293
00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:03.430
Anthony Taylor: so we just simply

294
00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:08.150
Anthony Taylor: encoded our quality color. Okay.

295
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:18.610
Anthony Taylor:  we also need that. The the variations of the quality column. So to do that. We'll do quality underscore columns.

296
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:23.690
Anthony Taylor: equals. And we'll do quality underscore encoder

297
00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.390
Anthony Taylor: dot, get

298
00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:30.329
Anthony Taylor: feature names out and tell it. We want both.

299
00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:34.199
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, does everyone remember what that does?

300
00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:48.069
Anthony Taylor: Am I forget what that does? Okay, that's alright. So this first one's gonna encode it. So remember. So from what we can see, we have okay and good. So it's gonna make quality. Okay? And put a one quality. Good, put a 0

301
00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:53.330
Anthony Taylor: right? If it's okay, if it's good. It's gonna be quality. Okay, is 0 quality. Good is one.

302
00:29:53.410 --> 00:30:02.140
Anthony Taylor: So everybody remembers. That's how one hiding photo works. Well, what quality columns is going to tell us, is where I said, quality underscore. Okay.

303
00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:10.690
Anthony Taylor: that's one column name, quality underscore. Good. That's another column. Name. Okay? All the column names that it came up with while

304
00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:17.329
Anthony Taylor: creating this, in fact. going to go in. And and you do not need to run this. But I am going to

305
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:21.829
Anthony Taylor: need to clean my screen. I thought I had a comma right there.

306
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.780
Anthony Taylor: Just to show you

307
00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:27.079
Anthony Taylor: what that would look like.

308
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:39.219
Anthony Taylor: So see? So we have a quality, bad quality, good quality. Okay? And that's what this this is doing here. Alright. So you can comment that up, you know. Read that

309
00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:46.389
Anthony Taylor:  And then we're going to create a little data frame with this called Df quality encoded.

310
00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:49.630
Anthony Taylor: And

311
00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:57.800
Anthony Taylor: that's and yes, so we're just gonna create it because we're gonna merge them all back together in a minute. So pd.is name

312
00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:02.610
Anthony Taylor: pass in quality encoded

313
00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:08.580
Anthony Taylor: and columns

314
00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:12.440
Anthony Taylor: equals quality columns.

315
00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:19.189
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so what do we do? All we did? We encoded quality.

316
00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:30.630
Anthony Taylor: And then we threw it into a little tiny data frame. Because in a minute we're gonna merge it back on with the rest of the data. Okay, now, we need to do the a similar thing with color. Now.

317
00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:43.140
Anthony Taylor: it's telling us here to do this. This one is, gonna be a little different. It's one on encoding for multiple categories.

318
00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:47.890
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So in this case, we're just gonna use label encoder.

319
00:31:47.950 --> 00:32:02.530
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna do it. A little different color encoder equals. we're going to initialize a label encoder. And then we're gonna fit, transform it. So. And and this one.

320
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:05.349
Anthony Taylor: in my opinion, way easier to use

321
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:09.160
cause we can do it really fast color

322
00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:11.360
Anthony Taylor: encoded

323
00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:15.100
Anthony Taylor: and equals.

324
00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:17.950
Anthony Taylor: And we're just gonna color

325
00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:23.270
encoder, dot

326
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:24.470
Anthony Taylor: pitch.

327
00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:31.050
Anthony Taylor: score, transform and pass in our df color.

328
00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.139
Anthony Taylor: I've always liked labeling code a bit.

329
00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:36.650
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

330
00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:42.099
Anthony Taylor: so this one pretty much will just add it to our existing data. Frame.

331
00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:50.350
Anthony Taylor: And now we'll go ahead and concatenate the quality on to

332
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:55.450
Anthony Taylor: our data frame. Okay, so we'll call it Df und process.

333
00:32:56.450 --> 00:33:00.800
Anthony Taylor: and that will equal Pd dot concat.

334
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:05.939
Anthony Taylor: And in the list. We'll put the the 2 data frames

335
00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:10.290
Anthony Taylor: and

336
00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.680
Anthony Taylor: and we're axi. So

337
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:16.010
Anthony Taylor: comma axis

338
00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:19.719
Anthony Taylor: it didn't give it to me, was what.

339
00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:21.390
Anthony Taylor: okay?

340
00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:31.020
Anthony Taylor: Alright, that looks good. Now we'll get rid of the original ones. We don't need them anymore. So and Df processed.

341
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:35.509
Anthony Taylor: we'll say equals df process.

342
00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:38.970
dot drop

343
00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:43.229
Anthony Taylor: and then put in the 2 columns. We're getting rid of.

344
00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:47.520
Anthony Taylor: Alright

345
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:50.770
Anthony Taylor: comma accident.

346
00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:51.980
this one.

347
00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:58.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then let's look at it and see how we ended up.

348
00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:12.819
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so if you look down here at the end we now have color encoded, which is just, it's

349
00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:18.469
Anthony Taylor: whatever it is. It could be more than just one at 0, by the way, but and then for

350
00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:23.670
Anthony Taylor: quality, we have a one hot encoded 0 0 1,

351
00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:26.069
Anthony Taylor: okay, or 1 0 0 whatever.

352
00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:28.350
Anthony Taylor: So everybody see what we did there.

353
00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:37.830
Anthony Taylor: everybody pretty comfortable with that step. It's really no different than what we've done in the past. We just did it twice

354
00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:44.940
Anthony Taylor: alright. Cause now we're gonna we're actually gonna predict all of these columns.

355
00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:47.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

356
00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:53.000
Anthony Taylor: alright. So here we are. Plain old train train test.

357
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:55.260
Anthony Taylor: Split

358
00:34:55.489 --> 00:34:58.219
Anthony Taylor: but to do our X,

359
00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:02.849
Anthony Taylor: we need to get rid of all of these cool new columns. We just made.

360
00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:07.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we could even probably copy that

361
00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:11.370
Anthony Taylor: and then say, X equals df

362
00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:15.010
Anthony Taylor: process. dot drop

363
00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:17.810
Anthony Taylor: columns

364
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:25.740
Anthony Taylor: equals base.

365
00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.610
Anthony Taylor: Look at that. Almost worked.

366
00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:55.889
Anthony Taylor: Okay. alright. So why? Because we really only need these columns as our X data. we're gonna have 2 Y variables. We're gonna have y underscore color.

367
00:35:56.180 --> 00:36:06.860
Anthony Taylor: And it's going to be Df underscore process bracket color encode it color encoding.

368
00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:12.089
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and then we're gonna have a Y underscore quality.

369
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:15.980
Anthony Taylor: and that's going to be Df

370
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:18.180
Anthony Taylor: underscore process

371
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:24.750
Anthony Taylor: underscore process bracket. And it's going to be all of the quality ones these 3.

372
00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:28.129
Anthony Taylor: No reason to copy those again.

373
00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:43.130
Clayton Graves:  you're copying power encoded instead of quality. Okay, you are absolutely right. Look at that. Thank you.

374
00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:47.870
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

375
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.860
Anthony Taylor: alright, good. So we have our our X data.

376
00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:57.150
Anthony Taylor: our first Y data and our second

377
00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.380
Anthony Taylor: wide data.

378
00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:09.390
Anthony Taylor: Now, we can do our train test splits. So this has been really long. So you're going to have X underscore train that one makes sense except for it needs to be an underscore.

379
00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:13.910
Anthony Taylor: Okay, comma X underscore test

380
00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:20.230
Anthony Taylor: comma y underscore color underscore train

381
00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:29.740
Anthony Taylor: comma y underscore color underscore test. Hello!

382
00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:32.170
Anthony Taylor: Why, underscore

383
00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:33.910
Anthony Taylor: quality

384
00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:41.830
Anthony Taylor: underscore train, and I put a V there. I think I put a V there?

385
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:43.400
Anthony Taylor: Why.

386
00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:47.700
Anthony Taylor: underscore quality underscore tests

387
00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:50.750
Anthony Taylor: equals drain.

388
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:55.860
Anthony Taylor: press split. And you're going to pass in X comma

389
00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:05.280
Anthony Taylor: y underscore color comma. Why. underscore quality. Gotcha.

390
00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:08.980
Anthony Taylor: Okay, let me make sure. I got that.

391
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.689
Anthony Taylor: I did put a V there, didn't it?

392
00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:15.410
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

393
00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.189
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So one more time

394
00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:20.520
Anthony Taylor: X. We got rid of all of our lakes.

395
00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:27.620
Anthony Taylor: Why, color we took just our encoded color label. Put it in Y color

396
00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:39.590
Anthony Taylor: quality are quality labels. Those columns we put in our. why underscore quality. And then we did a train test split on the whole thing. Sure.

397
00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:51.349
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So our input layer is pretty simple. It's simply input

398
00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:57.900
Anthony Taylor: layer. Now, remember, we don't have curios sequential. So it's going to look a little different as we build this out.

399
00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:00.710
Anthony Taylor: So in this first off, right away.

400
00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:06.900
Anthony Taylor: we're not going to build our input layer the way we built our input layer in a neural network, it's a little bit different.

401
00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:18.590
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna have layers dot input. And in parentheses. we're going to put the shape of our

402
00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:30.350
Anthony Taylor: X data in this case, the shape, as in how many nodes and the way we can do that is, we can say, X shape

403
00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:36.750
Anthony Taylor: brackets. one

404
00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:43.869
Anthony Taylor: close bracket comma. Okay? So that will give us

405
00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:48.830
Anthony Taylor: the the shape, and it will give us the second item in that shape.

406
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:56.350
Anthony Taylor: So you guys remember when you type shape, you get 2 numbers. Well, this will give us the second number of that shape.

407
00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:59.020
Anthony Taylor: and that'll be the end of

408
00:39:59.140 --> 00:39:59.890
Anthony Taylor: that.

409
00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:03.329
Anthony Taylor:  Oh! And you know what

410
00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:10.340
Anthony Taylor: I missed an opening parentheses. So at the beginning of that X shape do an open parenthesis.

411
00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:12.330
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

412
00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:21.020
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So after the shape we're gonna give it a name. And this name is gonna Be input Features. And you'll understand why, it meets a need

413
00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:22.819
Anthony Taylor: in just a moment.

414
00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:27.010
Anthony Taylor: And then close parentheses.

415
00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:34.050
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so there's our input layer. Actually.

416
00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:41.680
Anthony Taylor: not a hundred percent sure, we needed that. But anyway, okay, so now we're gonna have our shared

417
00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:46.270
Anthony Taylor: cinema layers. So when you look back at the fruit picture.

418
00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:53.209
Anthony Taylor: this one, we did this. Now we're going to do 2 of these.

419
00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.920
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and this isn't the fruit one. But

420
00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:59.899
Clayton Graves: same idea. Okay. So for the first, the first.

421
00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:03.229
Clayton Graves: the first layer doesn't look like it's shared, though

422
00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:11.450
Anthony Taylor: it well, we're about to do. That's what happened. Oh, oh, I got what you're saying right. But

423
00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:12.760
Anthony Taylor: the

424
00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:18.389
Anthony Taylor: these 2 are going down into here. Well, this one's not shared.

425
00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:22.969
Anthony Taylor: but this one is dependent on this one. So in that sense it is

426
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:29.680
Anthony Taylor: so. This whole block is just being continued to hear. and then continued to hear.

427
00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:37.550
Anthony Taylor: And that's what we're about to to do now. So first let's create those virtue layers. You do have to name the layers so shared

428
00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:39.370
Anthony Taylor: layer one

429
00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:45.779
Anthony Taylor: equals. We are going to create a dense layer because that's still what we call those hidden layers.

430
00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:49.860
Anthony Taylor: Alright, we're gonna give this 1 64 nodes

431
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:54.440
Anthony Taylor: and the activation will be Relu.

432
00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:57.660
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

433
00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:04.689
Anthony Taylor: now, outside of these parentheses create new parentheses and give it the name input

434
00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:06.290
Anthony Taylor: layer.

435
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:15.449
Anthony Taylor: Now, before I explain that, let's do the next 10, it's not layers. It's layers with an S.

436
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:18.439
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so let's do. Shared layer 2.

437
00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:25.119
Anthony Taylor: And again, layers period dense

438
00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:31.810
Anthony Taylor: parentheses. This one's only got to be 32 nodes. and we're going to use relu again.

439
00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:38.660
Anthony Taylor: Now, what do you think goes in the parentheses here

440
00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.120
michael mcpherson: output layer.

441
00:42:47.650 --> 00:42:52.680
Clayton Graves: No, it's the other direction. No, I think this is this one shared, isn't it?

442
00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.919
Clayton Graves: Isn't this? This is

443
00:42:55.930 --> 00:43:00.709
Clayton Graves: another. This is the second shared layer. We can even look back at the picture.

444
00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:13.629
Clayton Graves: Yeah. But technically, the first layer was considered the the input layer. This would be this would be the first shared layer.

445
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:18.149
Anthony Taylor: Well, this is the first. So you're saying, that's what goes here or

446
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:19.340
Clayton Graves: yeah.

447
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:21.459
Anthony Taylor: and that is correct.

448
00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:25.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so what this is doing, what this

449
00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:31.899
Anthony Taylor: parentheses at the end it's doing is showing you what's connected to.

450
00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:42.080
Anthony Taylor: So this first shared layer is connected to the input layer. The second shared layer is connected to the first shared layer.

451
00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:44.780
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

452
00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.750
Clayton Graves: That makes sure. Huh!

453
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:48.610
Anthony Taylor: Here we go.

454
00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.379
Baro, Sonja: Good job, Clayton. I was cheering for you.

455
00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:00.949
Anthony Taylor: Stop token.

456
00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:07.069
Anthony Taylor: So so now we're going to create. So these are the branches, these

457
00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:15.750
Anthony Taylor: little guys coming out here. Okay, these are branches of our thing. So we're going to do a branch for quality and a branch for color.

458
00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:23.510
Anthony Taylor: so for the quality output that's going to be a dense layer.

459
00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:34.560
Anthony Taylor: and it's going to have how how many. how many outputs are possible

460
00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:39.809
Anthony Taylor: for quality? What was that? Derek?

461
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:44.110
Derek Rikke: 3,

462
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:46.819
Anthony Taylor: 3. So we need

463
00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:55.299
Anthony Taylor: 3 nodes. All right. And because this one can have 3. The activations should be what

464
00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:01.950
michael mcpherson: sigmoid?

465
00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:06.729
Anthony Taylor:  same lines, too.

466
00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:09.429
Anthony Taylor: or basically one with multiple options.

467
00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:11.490
Anthony Taylor: Sophisticated idea. Okay.

468
00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:16.760
Anthony Taylor: that's all right. Hey? You know what? That's the whole point. We're learning over here

469
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:23.970
Anthony Taylor: alright. And the name we're gonna give this one a name. Quality output.

470
00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:28.489
Anthony Taylor: Now, what is it connected to?

471
00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:37.689
Anthony Taylor: I see 2. Sonia's on it. Sonia means shared 2. I think

472
00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:41.750
Anthony Taylor: right? Correct, this is gonna be connected

473
00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:45.439
Anthony Taylor: to here. So we're gonna say, share

474
00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:49.420
Anthony Taylor: underscore layer. 2.

475
00:45:50.120 --> 00:46:02.080
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And now for our color one which we put into one column. Okay. color output equals

476
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:04.769
Anthony Taylor: again, dense layer.

477
00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:09.400
Anthony Taylor: And there's only one output.

478
00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:12.789
Anthony Taylor: And our activation for this is going to be go, Mike.

479
00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:16.800
michael mcpherson: signally

480
00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:28.099
Anthony Taylor: alright ahead of time, that's all there was to it. Okay, and then we're gonna call this one color output

481
00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:34.000
Anthony Taylor: name equals. I don't really think those are necessary, but let's do it anyway.

482
00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:38.029
Anthony Taylor: And then, last, but not least, what is this one connected to?

483
00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:47.609
Clayton Graves: It's it's a branch, right? So it's going to be. Yes, sir, and it's gonna be the same layer. It's gonna be shared layer, too, like you, too nice. That is exactly correct.

484
00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:53.190
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so what does that mean? So let's just quickly walk through what that all means. Again, guys.

485
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:57.089
Anthony Taylor: same input, data. 2 hidden layers.

486
00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:01.149
Anthony Taylor: 2 separate outputs.

487
00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:02.570
Anthony Taylor: So whatever

488
00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:08.270
Anthony Taylor: thinking back to how neural networks work. whatever weights come up from here.

489
00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:12.679
Anthony Taylor: okay are gonna be passed into

490
00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:14.160
Anthony Taylor: this layer

491
00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:18.419
Anthony Taylor: and treated completely, separately

492
00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:19.930
Anthony Taylor: from this link.

493
00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:25.939
Anthony Taylor: Same weights will go into both, as we told it. Use shared layer 2.

494
00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:36.260
Anthony Taylor: But the outputs will be different. One. They were trained for different columns. But 2, they literally have different activations. I mean, they're completely different.

495
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:39.200
Anthony Taylor: even though they come

496
00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:41.080
Anthony Taylor: from the same inputs.

497
00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:46.890
Anthony Taylor: Alright, alright. So with that, we can now create our model

498
00:47:48.710 --> 00:48:00.320
Anthony Taylor: model equals model. And we're just gonna pass in all our stuff. So we're gonna pass in inputs equals input

499
00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:02.780
Anthony Taylor: layer.

500
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:10.099
Anthony Taylor: Oh, that's where those names are coming from, even though we call them the same thing. Aha!

501
00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:12.059
Anthony Taylor: That makes sense now.

502
00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:23.529
Anthony Taylor: because all we have to do when we create. Oh, automeric, all we have to do when we create our model is, give it the inputs and the outputs the stuff in the middle. We don't need to give it that

503
00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:31.729
Anthony Taylor: it'll figure all that out based on what we put in there. So here we'll have outputs equals, and it'll be the names we gave them

504
00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:32.899
Anthony Taylor: here and here

505
00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:35.190
Anthony Taylor: got it. So

506
00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:40.270
Anthony Taylor: quality. output.

507
00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:46.140
Anthony Taylor: color output. Yes, Meredith.

508
00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:54.700
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I had a question on the the step right before this with the color.

509
00:48:55.340 --> 00:49:00.270
Meredith McCanse (she/her): so with the color output, we said it was just one that there was one

510
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:07.500
Meredith McCanse (she/her): possible output, I think, but the possible color is one column

511
00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:13.640
Anthony Taylor: that can have multiple colors, multiple values. So that we've done lots

512
00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:16.300
Meredith McCanse (she/her): right? Okay?

513
00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:20.790
Meredith McCanse (she/her): But how did why does the one? But why does quality have 3 columns.

514
00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:23.180
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Is that because the one

515
00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:32.969
Anthony Taylor: because the one had included one hot encoder, and then we did label, Encoder. Right? So this one has to predict which one of those 3, it probably is.

516
00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:38.269
Anthony Taylor: Okay. This one just has to give us a probability on one call.

517
00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:41.880
Anthony Taylor: So it's either yes or no? Okay.

518
00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:50.140
Anthony Taylor: and then we do our model summary. Oh, gotta remember to compile what? Put this in the wrong place. That's okay.

519
00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:56.789
Anthony Taylor: So we got to do model dot compile. This is a lot of typing. I should just give you guys this one. But

520
00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:00.989
Anthony Taylor: since we're doing pretty good so far, we'll finish this one out and type in

521
00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:07.319
Anthony Taylor: optimizer equals Adam. This is all pretty common.

522
00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:14.070
Anthony Taylor: We can do loss equals. This is a lot.

523
00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:17.270
Anthony Taylor: So quality output.

524
00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:24.069
Anthony Taylor:  Poland categorical cross entropy.

525
00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:29.800
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So once you think about this one, I'm I'm going to type both of these before I ask a question.

526
00:50:30.570 --> 00:50:33.920
Anthony Taylor: Cost entropy.

527
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:38.669
Anthony Taylor: Think I got that spell right. and then the color output

528
00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:45.850
Anthony Taylor: is

529
00:50:46.170 --> 00:50:49.240
Anthony Taylor: binary. This is the one we've been using

530
00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:50.530
Anthony Taylor: cross

531
00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:57.000
Anthony Taylor: entropy. Now, I don't care if you remember what the cross entropy part is. But do you understand why they're different?

532
00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:04.240
Anthony Taylor: Categorical, because we have 3 separate columns binary, because we're just looking

533
00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:05.560
Anthony Taylor: at one

534
00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:17.030
Anthony Taylor: and then a comma after the curly bracket. Then we're going to do metrics. So again, we're going to put in metrics for

535
00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:18.180
Anthony Taylor: both

536
00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:23.439
Anthony Taylor: outputs, or, more effectively, all outputs.

537
00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:28.299
Anthony Taylor: Okay, cause if you just, I mean it could be more than one. You could have 10

538
00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:30.600
Anthony Taylor: different outputs if you really would.

539
00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:46.930
Anthony Taylor: And we've opted to keep them the same.

540
00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:51.690
Anthony Taylor: Alright, that's looking good. Last, we'll do a summary.

541
00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:59.290
Anthony Taylor: And I made a mistake. Input

542
00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:03.349
Dipinto, Matt: he didn't run the 2 prior cells.

543
00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.469
Anthony Taylor: I called it input, features.

544
00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:09.190
Dipinto, Matt: you have problems. So yeah, how is that possible?

545
00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:12.219
Dipinto, Matt: In ruby? Yeah, I. Still, I. Still.

546
00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:13.170
Anthony Taylor: I've

547
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:17.759
Dipinto, Matt: typed all that stuff and then didn't run it.

548
00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:19.480
Anthony Taylor: That's too funny.

549
00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:23.569
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But and this one's still wrong because it's input features.

550
00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:29.710
Anthony Taylor: Nope

551
00:52:31.110 --> 00:52:35.110
Anthony Taylor: input layer. So it's not the name. I really thought it would be the name

552
00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:40.940
Kanouff, Christine: we've got lose instead of loss in the next 2.

553
00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:44.249
Anthony Taylor: Look at you. Thank you very much.

554
00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:50.340
Anthony Taylor: Anything else. Before I push that right. Button still got it down.

555
00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:57.699
Anthony Taylor: Keyword argument, output model model input output equals

556
00:52:58.930 --> 00:53:01.470
Anthony Taylor: output the ads.

557
00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:03.950
Anthony Taylor: This is why I should type.

558
00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:08.999
Anthony Taylor: Okay, input output.

559
00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:11.540
sensor or function model must be

560
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:19.350
Anthony Taylor: the output of a tensorflow layer. thus holding the last metadata. So M,

561
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:23.969
Dipinto, Matt: it wants the object, not a string inside your outbook outputs list.

562
00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:26.139
Anthony Taylor: You are correct.

563
00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:28.160
Dipinto, Matt: So

564
00:53:28.570 --> 00:53:32.399
Dipinto, Matt: yeah, and how do you know this, Matt? Cause I'm staring at the solution.

565
00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:35.199
Anthony Taylor: Thank you for that.

566
00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:39.669
Anthony Taylor:  then there it is. Okay.

567
00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:41.190
Anthony Taylor: So

568
00:53:42.690 --> 00:53:45.010
Anthony Taylor: there you go. There's our model summer

569
00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:49.289
Anthony Taylor: alright. So the last part of this

570
00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:53.089
Anthony Taylor: is the fit step

571
00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:59.559
Anthony Taylor: model dot fits parentheses inside of here. We need X.

572
00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:09.850
Anthony Taylor: I gotta dust my screen off, I'm telling.

573
00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:14.809
Anthony Taylor: And then for the second argument, we need the both

574
00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:16.319
Anthony Taylor: of the

575
00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:23.849
Anthony Taylor:  possible y variable. So y underscore quality

576
00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:27.750
Anthony Taylor: and color

577
00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:31.580
Anthony Taylor: output.

578
00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:36.199
Anthony Taylor: Comma not comma Poland.

579
00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:38.530
Why, underscore code.

580
00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:40.020
Anthony Taylor: And

581
00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:50.449
Anthony Taylor: I hate that pop-up. That is so annoying. Okay? And then how many epics do we want? We'll do 10

582
00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:55.969
Anthony Taylor: and batch size.

583
00:54:57.770 --> 00:54:59.870
Anthony Taylor: We'll do 32,

584
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:04.130
Anthony Taylor: and validation split will be point 2

585
00:55:09.050 --> 00:55:10.100
Anthony Taylor: 0

586
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:12.980
Anthony Taylor: point 2. Not a split split

587
00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:15.340
Anthony Taylor: equals 0 point 2.

588
00:55:16.210 --> 00:55:18.739
Anthony Taylor: That should do it.

589
00:55:19.870 --> 00:55:21.099
Anthony Taylor: What I miss

590
00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:27.169
Anthony Taylor: unexpected output valid mode

591
00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:30.670
Anthony Taylor: quality output. Something in here is wrong.

592
00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:35.760
Masarirambi, Rodney: spelt incorrectly.

593
00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:39.250
Masarirambi, Rodney: It's uncommon. It's outcut.

594
00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:42.129
Anthony Taylor: That's the that's the Egyptian version.

595
00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:45.480
Anthony Taylor: There we

596
00:55:47.290 --> 00:55:49.849
Anthony Taylor: -oh! I knocked my at night over

597
00:55:55.270 --> 00:56:02.049
Anthony Taylor: model dot fits parentheses X quality output equals.

598
00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:15.579
Masarirambi, Rodney: I mean, you spell color wrong, but I think that that's taken under and tied on.

599
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:18.099
Anthony Taylor: I spelt it the American way.

600
00:56:21.130 --> 00:56:28.020
Anthony Taylor:  I'll tell you wrong.

601
00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:36.490
Anthony Taylor: I don't see what I did wrong there.

602
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:40.129
Anthony Taylor: Oh, okay, I did it again.

603
00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:48.919
Anthony Taylor: Did I not run the compile? I did

604
00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:54.379
Anthony Taylor: hate it when this happens.

605
00:56:54.770 --> 00:57:02.770
Masarirambi, Rodney: Oh, wait! Hold on did you run it off to? No, never mind.

606
00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:18.330
Anthony Taylor: I hate it. That's the only thing I don't like about this whole typing thing is when you do it.

607
00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:22.649
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, there was something wrong in there, too.

608
00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:39.069
michael mcpherson: My error says that instead of quality output, color, output, the valid output. Names are dense. Underscore 4 and dense underscore 5.

609
00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:50.420
Anthony Taylor: That wouldn't be right. No, I got it to work, I mean, II copied it from. I copied it from the solution file

610
00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:59.849
Anthony Taylor: because I wanted to see what the heck it was, but it's for sure it's supposed to be quality, output, color, output. and the same there and there.

611
00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:04.020
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. I'm sure I had something weird going on there.

612
00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:09.899
Anthony Taylor: But that's the idea we still typed it. Did it fail for anybody else?

613
00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:17.290
Anthony Taylor: Okay, good. Well, I'm glad it wasn't just me.

614
00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:26.150
Anthony Taylor: I know Matt's not typing, because he's just looking directly at the solution which I don't blame him. I would do exactly the same thing if I sitting in this.

615
00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:34.650
Dipinto, Matt: did you? Really? It's really no fun to freakin type like this, because there's so many possibilities for error.

616
00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:39.760
Anthony Taylor: And normally, that's not a big deal, because in the real world that's what happens.

617
00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:45.190
Anthony Taylor: You run into errors and you have to find them, and it's loads of fun.

618
00:58:45.370 --> 00:58:53.490
Anthony Taylor: and you usually don't have, like a whole bunch of students staring at it. just dying to catch you making an error.

619
00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:59.000
Anthony Taylor: which is at this point has become a game for me.

620
00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:04.060
Anthony Taylor: If I had a way to reward you, I would bored you

621
00:59:04.770 --> 00:59:06.860
Anthony Taylor: for catching my mistakes.

622
00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:09.839
Anthony Taylor: And, Matt, you by far

623
00:59:10.050 --> 00:59:13.670
Anthony Taylor: are the winner. So far this cohort.

624
00:59:17.890 --> 00:59:23.600
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. Got it to work alright. And then last, but not least, we're gonna print it all out.

625
00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:32.869
Anthony Taylor: Print f quality.

626
00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:34.580
Anthony Taylor: accuracy.

627
00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:42.740
Anthony Taylor: Oh, well got. And we want test results. 3.

628
00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:50.259
Anthony Taylor: I'm sure if we dig through that, we'll figure out why. But

629
00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:53.620
Anthony Taylor: I think I worry too much on that

630
00:59:55.090 --> 01:00:00.099
Anthony Taylor: and print, and and we will. If you guys want to know why it's we can do that

631
01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:01.800
Anthony Taylor: color

632
01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:03.490
Anthony Taylor: accuracy

633
01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:07.430
Anthony Taylor: as

634
01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:11.640
Anthony Taylor: bracket.

635
01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:14.580
Anthony Taylor: There we go.

636
01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:27.749
Anthony Taylor: So for quality, we were about 75% for color, we 96%. It's not

637
01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:31.640
Anthony Taylor: aye. not bad at all.

638
01:00:32.130 --> 01:00:36.830
Anthony Taylor: You guys understand the 3 and the 4. If we just print test results.

639
01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:46.710
Anthony Taylor: This is what we get. apparently 0 1, 2. The last 2 were the

640
01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:49.839
Anthony Taylor: well we got all those hands. Yes, Meredith.

641
01:00:53.110 --> 01:00:54.889
I had a question about

642
01:00:54.970 --> 01:01:00.450
Meredith McCanse (she/her): like. So if you're looking at all the outputs with the different epics. And the

643
01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:07.439
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I think, yeah, I think that the one we really care about is the one that's the act. So like the

644
01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:12.640
Meredith McCanse (she/her): quality, output, accuracy and color output accuracy.

645
01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:15.859
Meredith McCanse (she/her): But it it

646
01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:16.920
Meredith McCanse (she/her): is

647
01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:29.650
Meredith McCanse (she/her): in the next cell. When we then, are asking for the results. Is it just giving us the tenth epic? The numbers from the tenth epic, like, what's the difference between the it's actually running the test.

648
01:01:29.830 --> 01:01:31.430
Anthony Taylor: Those up here are trimmed.

649
01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:33.510
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay.

650
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:40.570
Anthony Taylor: yeah. So this is using your training data. And this is actually using your test data to give you your to tell you how you did.

651
01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:51.649
Anthony Taylor: And it's in that last cell. It's not doing. It's not like creating predictions or anything. It's literally just giving you a score

652
01:01:51.790 --> 01:01:54.850
Meredith McCanse (she/her): like, right here, you mean.

653
01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:58.819
Anthony Taylor: yeah, I'll it's just printing these last 2.

654
01:02:00.090 --> 01:02:10.340
Anthony Taylor: So these other ones were just. I'm I know what these other ones were to be honest with you. They don't make a ton of sense, but I'm sure they need something to somebody. What we want

655
01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:13.390
Anthony Taylor: for what we're doing was just these last 2 values.

656
01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:26.650
Meredith McCanse (she/her): But I get in. So in cell 20, sorry, I guess I described the wrong 1, 2 2 cells above where you are you're doing dot evaluate. It's literally just

657
01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:29.730
Meredith McCanse (she/her): taking the test data

658
01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:45.109
Anthony Taylor: and comparing it against the answers and telling you how close you were right. Just just like every time we ran score before same thing. It says, you finish training your model. Now we're going to train it against test data and tell you what your you know how well you did.

659
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:47.350
Yeah.

660
01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:50.629
Anthony Taylor: good. Good question. Yeah. Derek.

661
01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:59.509
Derek Rikke: How come you when you fit it? You don't use the train like X train and Y train. You just use the whole.

662
01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:03.999
Anthony Taylor: You know what? That's a good question. I wonder why we did that hold on.

663
01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:07.980
Anthony Taylor: because that's how they did it in the model. But it's wrong

664
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:11.040
Anthony Taylor: that is wrong.

665
01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:15.090
Dipinto, Matt: So

666
01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:22.929
Dipinto, Matt: I think the validation split. And so I agree that we did. A taint train test split earlier, and so it was wrong to do it that way.

667
01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:32.149
Dipinto, Matt: But if I was guessing the validation split variable in, there is literally a on the fly train test. Split. Yeah, maybe

668
01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:34.789
Dipinto, Matt: I still wanna do it this way.

669
01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:41.049
Anthony Taylor: I hear you. I hear you and I would I I wouldn't doubt it. But

670
01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:42.340
Anthony Taylor: I still want to

671
01:03:42.410 --> 01:03:48.149
Anthony Taylor: use the which means we're gonna figure out if you're right. Because if it is, we don't want to split it twice.

672
01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:57.750
Dipinto, Matt: So that's why I was typing earlier. so when we used validation data like 5 classes ago.

673
01:03:57.910 --> 01:04:01.000
Dipinto, Matt: is interesting. And so I think validation split

674
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:09.010
Dipinto, Matt: is a different form of that I haven't read up on yet. So that's still.

675
01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:11.469
Anthony Taylor: this is the beauty of

676
01:04:12.570 --> 01:04:16.220
Anthony Taylor: situations like this. So we'll say,

677
01:04:21.050 --> 01:04:31.060
Anthony Taylor: answer, flow. model and dot fit validation

678
01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:33.170
Anthony Taylor: split.

679
01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:35.910
Anthony Taylor: That might be enough.

680
01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:38.370
Anthony Taylor: Here we go.

681
01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:49.449
Anthony Taylor: No, it's resampling after each epic from the looks of it.

682
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:52.019
Anthony Taylor: Oh, no! Hold on.

683
01:04:58.290 --> 01:05:01.919
Dipinto, Matt: that's right from their documentation that I just dropped in chat

684
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:14.180
Dipinto, Matt: fraction of the training data we use as validation data model will set apart this fraction of the training data and will not train on it. So it's it's essentially a in model train test. Split. Yeah. So

685
01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:19.340
Anthony Taylor: I can see why they did that. I'm gonna remove it.

686
01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:22.860
Dipinto, Matt: But yeah, I mean, we're gonna use our actual training data

687
01:05:23.030 --> 01:05:29.489
Dipinto, Matt: redundant to having done a train test split already. So

688
01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:33.200
Anthony Taylor: we did use the test data for the evaluation.

689
01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:36.679
Dipinto, Matt: So the interesting thing is is

690
01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:42.079
Anthony Taylor: it may not be any better it could be might be cause you should be getting more data.

691
01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:45.109
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, it's not. It's the same.

692
01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:50.929
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So for those that were or we're not following along.

693
01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:55.429
Anthony Taylor: there was a variable in our.

694
01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:59.860
Anthony Taylor: or was that that was in our train. Our model

695
01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:04.470
Anthony Taylor: heck was that here?

696
01:06:04.530 --> 01:06:09.430
Anthony Taylor: So it was in our fit that was called, whether validation or whatever

697
01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:15.420
Anthony Taylor: that was basically splitting up our training data and knocking out 20% to do validation.

698
01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:19.780
Anthony Taylor:  we didn't need that because we already did

699
01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:21.610
Anthony Taylor: string test split.

700
01:06:21.730 --> 01:06:31.270
Anthony Taylor: So we just we changed the model dot fit from using the original data to using our training data. And then we correctly

701
01:06:31.470 --> 01:06:33.560
Anthony Taylor: tested with our testing data

702
01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:39.190
Anthony Taylor: effectively, all that really needs is, we add a little bit more training data

703
01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:44.530
Anthony Taylor: by removing that alright. So

704
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:48.169
Anthony Taylor: there you go. But that's a cool feature to know about. I like.

705
01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:51.590
Anthony Taylor: okay.

706
01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.970
Anthony Taylor: so we've done it any.

707
01:06:54.060 --> 01:07:01.430
Baro, Sonja: So on that, Anthony, if you were to use it where? So you wouldn't do a train test split

708
01:07:01.610 --> 01:07:06.119
Baro, Sonja: if you're gonna use your validation stuff that doesn't make sense to me.

709
01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:11.170
Baro, Sonja: I like, where would you put it?

710
01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:27.650
Anthony Taylor: See? Like this guy saying, I always use train tests. But I'm thinking that's kind of what the thought was. I should point out that this is a fixed validation set which is chosen after suppling

711
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:43.109
Anthony Taylor: to get separate validation data sets and then use validation argument in the fit instead of validation. Split and point to the X and Y and C. That's pretty much what I'm seeing everybody's saying, and don't use that. But it's just one article.

712
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.750
Anthony Taylor: I'd have to dig into it more if I'm being honest with you.

713
01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:48.820
Baro, Sonja: Okay.

714
01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:59.950
Anthony Taylor: I have not used it before that particular way. We always do a train test split always. And my stuff. So

715
01:08:01.350 --> 01:08:03.939
Anthony Taylor: even in Ottawa, you do drug testing.

716
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.309
Anthony Taylor: Even in Gui.

717
01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:10.880
Anthony Taylor: we use pinterest. So yeah, I haven't seen that done before.

718
01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:16.959
Anthony Taylor: Thank you for pointing that out. I actually, I think I'm gonna say I learned something.

719
01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:24.759
Anthony Taylor: Don't use that stop following the stuff that they give me in my

720
01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:28.999
Anthony Taylor: lesson plan. Okay, so alright. Everybody.

721
01:08:29.050 --> 01:08:33.819
Anthony Taylor: Any other questions about branching? You got the idea now, right, Rodney, you good.

722
01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:40.509
Anthony Taylor: I know it was boring as hell, wasn't it? I shouldn't give you all the solution that way. You have to type with.

723
01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:44.730
Clayton Graves: I have a question that the solution, yeah, as it's written.

724
01:08:45.149 --> 01:08:47.240
Clayton Graves: does not work in my environment.

725
01:08:47.670 --> 01:08:51.039
Clayton Graves: the solution should be in covap.

726
01:08:51.939 --> 01:08:58.399
Clayton Graves: right? So if I run it in my environment, it doesn't work. But if I run it in Cola, it does.

727
01:08:58.790 --> 01:09:03.819
Clayton Graves: Yeah, there's something about this one. It does.

728
01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:08.210
Clayton Graves: Colab uses tensorflow 2.15.

729
01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:12.570
Clayton Graves: My environment uses 2 dot 16 dot one.

730
01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:19.120
Anthony Taylor: That's entirely possible. It does work for me.

731
01:09:20.850 --> 01:09:25.749
Anthony Taylor:  what part of flow are you using? Yeah.

732
01:09:25.810 --> 01:09:28.370
Anthony Taylor: how did you check your tensorflow version?

733
01:09:28.729 --> 01:09:30.069
Clayton Graves: You print

734
01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:34.869
Clayton Graves: parentheses. Tf dot underscore.

735
01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:40.899
Anthony Taylor: France, yeah. dot underscore underscore.

736
01:09:42.790 --> 01:09:43.850
Anthony Taylor: That's gonna ask.

737
01:09:45.850 --> 01:09:50.490
Clayton Graves: Oh, I don't even have. Tf, yeah, you gotta import it. There's Gap

738
01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:00.740
Anthony Taylor: 2.1 5

739
01:10:02.570 --> 01:10:07.649
Clayton Graves: works for you. I think I think the version that I have is is causing it to not work.

740
01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:15.240
Anthony Taylor: It is possible, I will tell you, though, before the end of the day, the last one we do does not work for.

741
01:10:17.330 --> 01:10:28.629
Anthony Taylor: And and actually, it's more of a pickling error than anything. But we're but that's why I told you guys just go straight to Co. Web. because I know everything works in co-labbed.

742
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:35.649
Anthony Taylor: Hi. If there are no other questions. it is break time.

743
01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:41.939
Anthony Taylor: You're like what? No, really it is. So

744
01:10:42.190 --> 01:10:43.630
Anthony Taylor: give you out till

745
01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:53.759
Anthony Taylor: the hour the top of the hour. Right. Would that be 80'clock for you guys? Alright, I'll see you at 80'clock. so I have an example of using Chat Gp, in a way that

746
01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:57.670
Anthony Taylor: you may or may not even have thought. Okay.

747
01:10:57.780 --> 01:11:04.450
Anthony Taylor:  I was doing a requirement today, and I don't know 25 columns of data.

748
01:11:04.990 --> 01:11:13.640
Anthony Taylor: and about 20 of them all needed data transformation. So ask the float cast int

749
01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:21.859
Anthony Taylor: stuff like that, right. And I mean, I could've went through and typed. Oh, I but instead.

750
01:11:22.670 --> 01:11:29.830
Anthony Taylor: I just copied the 2 columns from Excel, which was the column name and the data type. And I said.

751
01:11:31.210 --> 01:11:37.460
Anthony Taylor: Write me spark code. That would convert all of these to, you know, are all of these columns based on this grid.

752
01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:52.659
Anthony Taylor: like. 3 s later I had all of it done something that probably would have took me at least 2030 min. I did in like 1 min. That's the value of these tools.

753
01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:58.499
Anthony Taylor: Okay, not how do I do it? It's help me do this.

754
01:11:59.330 --> 01:12:10.180
Anthony Taylor: And as long as we treat them as assistants. right? I mean, the cool thing is is you can also. you can also treat them as as a a

755
01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:16.200
Anthony Taylor: tutor or an instructor. But ultimately your goal will be to treat them as assistants.

756
01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:20.610
Clayton Graves: I mean III ask them all the time, how how do you do this?

757
01:12:21.230 --> 01:12:30.200
Clayton Graves: And you're using them as a tutor right now. You're losing syntax and things like that. I'm not writing

758
01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:46.329
Clayton Graves: and having it do it for me. I'm I'm like, Hey, I'm having a I'm having a problem here. This is my error. You know. What what should I be looking for? And it'll tell you, and then you go look for it. You're like, Oh, yep, that's a problem and fix it, and everything's fine.

759
01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:54.040
Anthony Taylor: Well, in a lot of tools, I mean, I'll tell you the tool I use every day at work has a built in Chat Gpt. Engine. Now.

760
01:12:54.320 --> 01:13:01.169
Anthony Taylor: where I can just say, Hey, what's wrong with this something done? Where? What's wrong with this I can even like go control. I

761
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:05.549
Anthony Taylor: write some code that does this and brutally writes it fills it in. I mean, it's

762
01:13:05.770 --> 01:13:07.710
Anthony Taylor: it's as simple as it can be.

763
01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:09.870
It still gets it wrong

764
01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:14.060
Anthony Taylor: often enough that you have to know what you're doing. But,

765
01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:24.439
Anthony Taylor: The the cool thing about all of this stuff is, and and and you know all I could think of. So how many of you guys saw that link I pulled in the other day with the robot that had the apple.

766
01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:28.879
Anthony Taylor: It was amazing if you haven't seen it yet. It's pretty freaking crazy.

767
01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:44.810
Anthony Taylor:  But they were. But they were saying, you know the I robot. They weren't doing Terminator exactly. They were going more down the irobot side of things, which were, if you guys haven't seen that. Yes, it goes sideways. Of course it would be a good movie if it didn't.

768
01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:48.440
Anthony Taylor: But the irobot were basically robots that were assistants

769
01:13:48.770 --> 01:13:59.640
Anthony Taylor: to everybody. I mean they were maids. They were nannies, they were. you know, they worked. They did everything, and it freed up people to be well, something different.

770
01:14:00.010 --> 01:14:02.480
Anthony Taylor: and that.

771
01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:05.560
Anthony Taylor: I believe, is a reality

772
01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:22.360
Anthony Taylor: that we may even see. Many of you will see before you know we we move on to the next, whatever I think that's going to happen in our generation, not to the degree it is in the movie, of course, but I think there will be assistance.

773
01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:26.739
Anthony Taylor: you know, and and again, and the reason I bring that up is

774
01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:36.650
Anthony Taylor: as as long as we always use this these machines as the system, and don't let them take over, and I don't mean take over the world. I mean.

775
01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:41.410
Anthony Taylor: we just, you know. I don't make decisions anymore. I don't need to do this.

776
01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:54.220
Anthony Taylor: I think will always be good. But that's just, old man advice. It's really not anything for you. because I don't really know. It's like none of us really know. Alright.

777
01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:56.229
Anthony Taylor: let us continue.

778
01:14:58.670 --> 01:15:10.039
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So we have yet another. Everyone do. And of course, you guys already have. See? This is why I don't give the solutions cause. It's no fun. It's like, well, what's the point? If you already have the solution?

779
01:15:10.810 --> 01:15:22.219
Baro, Sonja:  one nice thing I was just gonna say, having just tried to keep up

780
01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:34.990
Baro, Sonja: with you. It's easier because now I, instead of uploading the unsolved, I'll just see the solved, and then I can like track with you better rather than go. Oh, my God! I misspelled this. I have to go back and fix it

781
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:46.620
Anthony Taylor: so that is a benefit. II agree with that I agree with that. I could see that the biggest, the only thing with me is is is like, as you guys can see if I do a type or something it's like.

782
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:50.299
Anthony Taylor: but who else? Somebody else had a thought on that.

783
01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:55.350
Raugewitz, Tania: No, this is Tonya. My pictures frozen. But I agree with Sonia.

784
01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:58.729
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Alright. Well.

785
01:15:58.830 --> 01:16:08.280
Anthony Taylor: okay. for really long ones like this, I think I think I got. I agree with you because these are so much tight.

786
01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:14.039
Anthony Taylor: But I think this one's worse than the last week, too.

787
01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:22.850
Anthony Taylor: It looks longer. Yeah, we made this one. We may. I may just pay some stuff to you, even though you already have it.

788
01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:25.760
Anthony Taylor: I may still just paste some stuff to you.

789
01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:29.750
Anthony Taylor: Want to clear all the outputs. There we go.

790
01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:31.909
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. Maybe

791
01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:40.979
Anthony Taylor: I'm hoping they have a lot of it done. But this one's important because I believe the next exercise you guys are gonna do all this on.

792
01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:43.520
Anthony Taylor: So we got to get through this?

793
01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:54.549
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So first, let's import some data and some columns. And so this is that same steps. It's still a thing I don't like this, because we already did all of this.

794
01:16:56.060 --> 01:17:03.759
Anthony Taylor: That's all right. We'll push through it. So remember, we're getting the file list. Then we're gonna pull in the faces data.

795
01:17:04.410 --> 01:17:07.170
Anthony Taylor: There's the yeah. Urls

796
01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:09.320
Anthony Taylor: exciting

797
01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:15.039
Anthony Taylor: and then here's our 644 images.

798
01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:16.700
Anthony Taylor: Boop.

799
01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.070
Anthony Taylor: that'll take a while.

800
01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:24.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so all this stuff we've done trying to see if there's anything we haven't done here yet.

801
01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.730
Anthony Taylor: Even this step we've already done.

802
01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:36.759
Anthony Taylor: But since we have to wait, you know 3 or 4 min for it to finish processing. I guess we could type it in

803
01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:38.539
Anthony Taylor: just for extra

804
01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:41.660
Anthony Taylor: stuff.

805
01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:47.729
Anthony Taylor: So fun, okay, where are we?

806
01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:51.680
Anthony Taylor: Let's look at our file names and prepare our model.

807
01:17:57.460 --> 01:17:58.250
Okay?

808
01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:02.760
Anthony Taylor: And

809
01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:07.720
Anthony Taylor:  mmm.

810
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.780
Anthony Taylor: okay. So we got the pixel values

811
01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:17.420
Anthony Taylor: file names. They have had all right.

812
01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:24.719
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we remember that we have user, id pose, expression and eyes.

813
01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:30.259
Anthony Taylor: So we'll create a file names or we'll pull from file names. Df.

814
01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:33.399
Anthony Taylor: and we'll get user id.

815
01:18:35.450 --> 01:18:36.530
folks.

816
01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:39.190
Anthony Taylor: expression

817
01:18:40.970 --> 01:18:44.400
Anthony Taylor: and eyes. Okay?

818
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:46.950
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna take those.

819
01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:49.380
Anthony Taylor: And

820
01:18:54.050 --> 01:19:01.269
Anthony Taylor: oh, we're just gonna basically make new columns with each of these in it alright. That's what we're doing. So yeah, we've done this a couple of times now.

821
01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.640
Anthony Taylor: In class.

822
01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:14.980
Anthony Taylor: So we'll do dot string dot replace. and we're gonna get rid of the Png first dot P. And G comma empty.

823
01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:17.149
Anthony Taylor: and then we'll do. Oh.

824
01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:21.680
Anthony Taylor: I want Redjax

825
01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:25.070
Anthony Taylor: Falls.

826
01:19:27.650 --> 01:19:36.840
Anthony Taylor: I'll bet you anything that's the default. But whatever I could be wrong and then last, we're gonna split on the underscore stream. Drop, split

827
01:19:38.290 --> 01:19:45.190
Anthony Taylor: dot underscore. and then expand it to new columns.

828
01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:50.220
Baro, Sonja: Anthony, is this where you did the triple quotations

829
01:19:51.530 --> 01:19:54.880
Anthony Taylor: on this one? No. now.

830
01:19:55.080 --> 01:20:09.740
Anthony Taylor: just yeah, it's just just work. So like in the in the, in the solution. They have the slash they're doing. Yeah, it's just because they have the slash there. III we didn't need it, cause we had plenty of of room.

831
01:20:09.930 --> 01:20:14.310
Anthony Taylor: But I mean, if you wanted to do the yeah, you just would put a slash.

832
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:28.430
Anthony Taylor: And then last we got y underscore df equals. Hi, I'll name. See! I gotta keep you guys on your toes. Since you're looking at the solution already. It's like, Oh, well, I gotta really mess up every once in a while.

833
01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:44.990
Anthony Taylor: No, I really don't like messing up to be honest with sometimes that's exactly right, right. I can always count on Matt's paying attention, whereas Matt Matt so good. Yeah.

834
01:20:45.330 --> 01:20:46.460
Anthony Taylor: you're not home.

835
01:20:46.990 --> 01:20:54.040
Dipinto, Matt: I'm in Boise, my my other. Oh, you're still in Boise. I came back for the weekends.

836
01:20:54.530 --> 01:20:56.170
Anthony Taylor: How exciting!

837
01:20:56.380 --> 01:20:59.950
Anthony Taylor: I guess it's got a real heavy nightlife out there.

838
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:03.060
Clayton Graves: You're doing it on purpose

839
01:21:03.670 --> 01:21:05.120
Dipinto, Matt: going to Boise

840
01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:09.170
Dipinto, Matt: work. So much work work.

841
01:21:09.610 --> 01:21:11.079
michael mcpherson: Boise is lovely.

842
01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:16.479
Dipinto, Matt: It is actually pretty nice. It's like kind of cute. It's not not bad.

843
01:21:17.090 --> 01:21:18.740
Anthony Taylor: So like a little town.

844
01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:27.419
Dipinto, Matt: It's got a downtown. I think it's honestly got like a 4 by 4 set of blocks that make up like proper downtown. So it's a pretty small city.

845
01:21:28.730 --> 01:21:32.880
Anthony Taylor: I have only driven through the North like twice in my lifetime

846
01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:35.930
Anthony Taylor: anything above like

847
01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:40.860
Anthony Taylor: Missouri, St. Louis, anything above that

848
01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:45.979
Anthony Taylor: drove through it like once, twice in my life. That's it.

849
01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:47.499
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So let's get.

850
01:21:48.510 --> 01:21:50.109
Anthony Taylor: Oh, this is interesting.

851
01:21:54.590 --> 01:21:57.019
Anthony Taylor: Oh, this is working. What?

852
01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:01.889
Anthony Taylor: Okay? It must have finished. Okay, I was like, how is that happening? Alright? So

853
01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:03.830
Anthony Taylor: we finished processing.

854
01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:11.680
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna see? Oh, okay. Blah, blah, blah! We've like said, we've done all this. This is all the size. There, there, now, we're gonna resize everything. 6, 4, 6.

855
01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:14.859
Anthony Taylor: We're going to convert our points to floats.

856
01:22:15.170 --> 01:22:22.559
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna normalize by dividing by 255, and then

857
01:22:23.010 --> 01:22:27.610
Anthony Taylor: we're going to split the columns. Now, let's look at the user id

858
01:22:27.650 --> 01:22:28.670
Anthony Taylor: column.

859
01:22:29.350 --> 01:22:34.079
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna say, why, yeah.

860
01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:39.559
Anthony Taylor: And somehow or another ended up too many quotes there

861
01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:42.830
Anthony Taylor: and do a value caps. Okay.

862
01:22:46.270 --> 01:22:52.129
Anthony Taylor: we can see we have quite a few different ones there. So again.

863
01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:55.199
Anthony Taylor: this still feels like we're doing something we did the other day.

864
01:22:56.060 --> 01:23:05.149
Anthony Taylor:  we're gonna do user id and code. Oh, I remember, y, no, okay. So we're going to do user id encoder.

865
01:23:05.410 --> 01:23:06.670
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

866
01:23:07.450 --> 01:23:16.639
Anthony Taylor: I know why we're doing this all again because we're gonna do it a little differently when we did the other day. So for this one, we're gonna use one hot encoder, which to me seems nuts.

867
01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:18.780
Anthony Taylor: But okay.

868
01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:26.180
Anthony Taylor:  we're going to do so. Parse output equals false.

869
01:23:27.190 --> 01:23:30.329
Anthony Taylor: And then we're gonna fit. Transform it.

870
01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:41.249
Anthony Taylor: Id coder. Oh, encoded equals user Id and code dot hit transform

871
01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:47.730
Anthony Taylor: parentheses y and

872
01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:51.670
Anthony Taylor: that user. Id.

873
01:23:52.690 --> 01:23:53.620
Anthony Taylor: okay.

874
01:23:53.990 --> 01:24:04.219
Anthony Taylor: all right. So we have our encoded user id, we still need to get the columns and stuff like we did earlier today. Okay.

875
01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:06.470
Anthony Taylor: so we're gonna do columns.

876
01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:11.869
Anthony Taylor: equals and user id encoded.

877
01:24:13.090 --> 01:24:18.800
Anthony Taylor: Nope encoder dot get feature names out.

878
01:24:19.010 --> 01:24:21.889
Anthony Taylor: And we just want user id

879
01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:22.840
Anthony Taylor: column.

880
01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:30.399
Anthony Taylor: Okay, everybody remember what that does. That gets us all the columns that one hot encoder made from

881
01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:33.300
Anthony Taylor: our data. So now

882
01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:39.249
Anthony Taylor: let's create a little df. that we're going to use in a little bit

883
01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:42.270
Anthony Taylor: to bring it all back together again.

884
01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:49.690
Clayton Graves: and the result of all that is going to be a list of all the usernames. And then it's going to be 1 0, right?

885
01:24:50.680 --> 01:25:00.119
Anthony Taylor: Well, yeah, each one. So there only be one per. Yeah. It's gonna be a lot. I don't know how you're there. Looks like 30 of them.

886
01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:02.470
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, there's gonna be a lot of

887
01:25:03.690 --> 01:25:06.090
user encoded column

888
01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:10.910
Anthony Taylor: equals User Id at the score column.

889
01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:15.010
Anthony Taylor: Hopefully, that I'm getting typos in there

890
01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:18.649
Anthony Taylor: and then we'll just take a look at the first couple.

891
01:25:25.140 --> 01:25:28.789
Anthony Taylor: Look at that. So yeah, we can see there's a lot of them there.

892
01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:37.040
Anthony Taylor: Okay. alright. So it says, repeat the process for the pose column.

893
01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:41.709
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we will just I will do the the.

894
01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:45.419
Anthony Taylor: I'll do the value counts without.

895
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:50.670
Anthony Taylor: But I am gonna probably pay. I'm not gonna type all that other stuff yet. So I'll be set over. You guys.

896
01:25:50.930 --> 01:25:52.829
Anthony Taylor: I know you already have it. But

897
01:25:53.980 --> 01:26:00.299
Baro, Sonja: yeah, and you're gonna have to do that for a bunch more. I know we're gonna do it for all of them

898
01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:02.689
Baro, Sonja: in the end. Yes.

899
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:04.710
oops

900
01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:06.480
Anthony Taylor: gotta remember that.

901
01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:11.400
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we have left straight up and right.

902
01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:16.219
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna do exactly what we did up above. But we're gonna do it with

903
01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:17.650
Anthony Taylor: hose.

904
01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:21.060
Anthony Taylor: So I'm going to just put this into slack.

905
01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:37.220
Clayton Graves: You don't. You don't have to put it in slack if you don't want to. I mean well, I know, but you know what not. Everybody is necessarily looking right at it, so I'll put it there for that.

906
01:26:37.330 --> 01:26:40.249
Anthony Taylor: So, Biggie. it's good practice for me.

907
01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:44.229
Anthony Taylor: I mean, I got a copy of paste it, anyway, so I might as well, paste it in there.

908
01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:48.200
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so there, now, we have pose.

909
01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:54.340
Anthony Taylor: Then we're gonna do the same thing for expression.

910
01:26:54.780 --> 01:26:58.540
Anthony Taylor: So you know, I'm gonna save me a second. Just copy. This line

911
01:26:59.470 --> 01:27:00.589
Anthony Taylor: come down here

912
01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:03.580
Anthony Taylor: changes to expression.

913
01:27:07.630 --> 01:27:17.060
Anthony Taylor: and there we go again exactly the same thing, except this time it's for expression. So we'll copy

914
01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:25.159
Anthony Taylor: paste that in there

915
01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:28.750
Anthony Taylor: paste that in there.

916
01:27:30.010 --> 01:27:37.190
Anthony Taylor: Now I these, I'm kind of going through fast. Now, is everybody okay with this code, everybody kind of following what we're doing here.

917
01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:41.070
Anthony Taylor: So all we're doing is, you know, we're looking at it. And then

918
01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:42.799
Anthony Taylor: where?

919
01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:45.310
Anthony Taylor: we're just encoding it right now.

920
01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:48.920
So and then we're gonna do eyes.

921
01:27:49.570 --> 01:27:55.730
Anthony Taylor: So same value counts. This time we're gonna look at. I

922
01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:03.970
Derek Rikke: you should have made the first one into a function, and just pass all these through.

923
01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:05.600
Anthony Taylor: Dang it.

924
01:28:06.510 --> 01:28:11.019
Clayton Graves: Derek, that's freaking, brilliant! That's your job.

925
01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:16.680
Anthony Taylor: That's Derek. I love that. III just like that a lot. I think that's really, really cool.

926
01:28:17.650 --> 01:28:19.949
Is there anything special about this one.

927
01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:28.009
Anthony Taylor: this one? We're dropping the others? We did not. Okay. So this one, because there's only 2,

928
01:28:28.170 --> 01:28:37.730
Anthony Taylor: right? We learned this a long time ago, right? If you only have 2 values, you really don't need to columns. you know. One column with just one flag.

929
01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:40.859
So it's a little different.

930
01:28:40.870 --> 01:28:45.150
Anthony Taylor: just slightly. But I will throw it into slack

931
01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:48.659
Anthony Taylor: and point it out.

932
01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:56.100
Anthony Taylor: So right here we're gonna actually drop

933
01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:58.760
Anthony Taylor: the first column value.

934
01:28:58.770 --> 01:29:00.320
Anthony Taylor: So we end up with just

935
01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:02.519
Anthony Taylor: true or false one or 0.

936
01:29:03.490 --> 01:29:04.350
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

937
01:29:06.010 --> 01:29:16.209
Anthony Taylor: All right. Okay. I'm going to give you guys this one, too. So now we're gonna take all of the data friends we just made and combine them together

938
01:29:18.110 --> 01:29:19.419
Anthony Taylor: just like that.

939
01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:35.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so let's walk through this. So we have this new data frame called process df. and we're gonna do concat. We're gonna concat user id encoded pose, encoded expression encoded eyes and code.

940
01:29:36.370 --> 01:29:41.520
Anthony Taylor: Alright. but I do. And then take a peek.

941
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:46.109
Did I call it? Something different in expression.

942
01:29:52.650 --> 01:29:54.590
Anthony Taylor: Expression encoded the yeah.

943
01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:58.379
Anthony Taylor: Oh, eyes and Covid! Oh, I didn't run it. Huh?

944
01:29:58.490 --> 01:29:59.170
It's fine.

945
01:30:00.130 --> 01:30:05.309
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So now we have all the encoded data.

946
01:30:06.750 --> 01:30:10.570
Anthony Taylor: So basically, this is like all of our Y variables. Slot.

947
01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:12.780
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

948
01:30:13.180 --> 01:30:22.830
Anthony Taylor: alright. So now we're gonna do that augmenting stuff again. Well, we can. We can start it. We'll we'll do it for a while. This isn't too much.

949
01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:29.380
Anthony Taylor: So X equals, NP. Array normalized images.

950
01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:35.950
Anthony Taylor: So if you guys remember what we're doing here is we're simply

951
01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:40.589
Anthony Taylor: going to create more views of our images.

952
01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:50.059
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So we're gonna take our little pictures, move around a little bit. Kind of give the model something, a little more data to work with.

953
01:30:50.780 --> 01:30:51.910
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

954
01:30:53.010 --> 01:30:54.380
Anthony Taylor: processed?

955
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:09.659
Anthony Taylor: Well for image and X, we're going to do image equals

956
01:31:10.570 --> 01:31:14.980
Anthony Taylor: Anthony. Can I ask a question while you're go ahead? Of course.

957
01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:21.949
Baro, Sonja: So so augmenting? I know we're doing that because it adds data into the training.

958
01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:31.149
Baro, Sonja: But where I was wondering is, when do you decide to use a Cnn because that was do? Oh, that was reducing. It wasn't adding right?

959
01:31:31.940 --> 01:31:45.699
Anthony Taylor: The Cnn itself it reduces. Yeah. So if you have, like a you know, 1,000 by 1,000, let's it might down to 700 by 7. So it's the opposite actually cause. Then it would be rough.

960
01:31:45.790 --> 01:31:48.450
Anthony Taylor: right? Cause that's for training.

961
01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:51.000
Anthony Taylor: That's for teaching the model.

962
01:31:51.050 --> 01:31:56.519
Baro, Sonja: This, I mean, yes, this is technically, we're teaching a model. But we're trying to give it more data to teach from

963
01:31:56.780 --> 01:32:02.220
Anthony Taylor: now, there is a huge problem with this, right? When you use it.

964
01:32:02.530 --> 01:32:07.140
Clayton Graves: you're using it to shrink the picture right? It's not necessarily

965
01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:13.890
Clayton Graves: about your data. Set your data, frame it. It's it's the. It's the the image that you're

966
01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:18.079
Clayton Graves: for. The Cnn, yeah. Well, you're trying to

967
01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:21.300
Anthony Taylor: reduce extra.

968
01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:31.590
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So if you have a background, you don't care about the background. You want to look at the foreground. That's where Cnn is fantastic. These pictures, Cnn is great, because if you guys look at these pictures they all have a black background.

969
01:32:32.130 --> 01:32:37.049
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, the problem with increasing the number of these pictures.

970
01:32:37.790 --> 01:32:42.299
Anthony Taylor: let's say we get it to the point where every single I take y'all's pictures the same way.

971
01:32:42.460 --> 01:32:48.559
Anthony Taylor: and every single time it can identify, you know Furry's picture. Just it's perfect.

972
01:32:48.710 --> 01:32:52.240
Anthony Taylor: Okay, every time we show it. Curry hat. No hat.

973
01:32:53.090 --> 01:32:56.320
Anthony Taylor: right? Must ask beer. No, must beard

974
01:32:56.490 --> 01:32:57.590
Anthony Taylor: doesn't care.

975
01:32:57.750 --> 01:33:02.659
Anthony Taylor: Gets it every time. But then we put curry in Boise. Idaho.

976
01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:14.580
Anthony Taylor: okay. background has now changed because we did so much training on the model with the black background new background.

977
01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:17.510
Anthony Taylor: It doesn't know who curry is in.

978
01:33:18.910 --> 01:33:23.699
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so it's not there. There's there's a lot of things you have to consider. But

979
01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:26.360
Anthony Taylor: when we don't have a ton of

980
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:30.160
Anthony Taylor: of data, this is a very nice way

981
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:43.510
Anthony Taylor: to augment. And and it's honestly I would not say, I would say that while you may not do this as much with as small amount of data as we have. But if you had.

982
01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:48.279
Anthony Taylor: let's say we had 50 pictures of each of these people in different backgrounds.

983
01:33:49.210 --> 01:33:53.800
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Then augmenting it could actually be very valuable

984
01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:57.029
Anthony Taylor: right? Yes, Meredith.

985
01:33:58.690 --> 01:34:01.440
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I have a question about the stuff that we're on right now.

986
01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:05.599
Meredith McCanse (she/her): We're we're augmenting the X

987
01:34:06.670 --> 01:34:13.969
Meredith McCanse (she/her): data added data to it. But when we do the train test split.

988
01:34:14.250 --> 01:34:20.729
Meredith McCanse (she/her): So we'll we're going to tell it. The source for the X stuff is going to be this new augmented X process.

989
01:34:21.250 --> 01:34:31.529
Meredith McCanse (she/her): We didn't add data to the Y process stuff that we just did. So they're gonna be 2. Those 2 data frames are gonna have different

990
01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:41.670
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Nope sheep. They're gonna have diff awesome but different shapes, like the different number that we just added a bunch of images to the X set. But we didn't never add anything to the Y set.

991
01:34:45.170 --> 01:34:50.070
Meredith McCanse (she/her): It's understanding how that works. Yeah, no, I'm sure. Yeah, no, you're right. I'm trying to see.

992
01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:53.230
Anthony Taylor: It's almost like it's

993
01:34:55.570 --> 01:35:08.400
Dipinto, Matt: so. All this did was we haven't actually augmented yet. This just added the the batch number, the Channel dimension to all the Grayscale images. I assume this isn't doing the augmentation.

994
01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:17.939
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, augmentation is still coming. Yeah, this is where we're gonna do the augmentation. Excellent point. Thank you. Matt.

995
01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:23.259
Anthony Taylor: So yeah, so all exactly. So this, see this here.

996
01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:37.510
Anthony Taylor: Remember how we had the size dimension. And when we had, you know, we needed to add the extra bit inside the tuple. So this is just going to add the one at the end of the tuple to say, this is grayscale.

997
01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:41.979
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Oh, got it? Okay, yeah, that's all that's gonna happen?

998
01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:52.679
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Do we have to add the number at the beginning to like we did in previous? No, because well, we're at least not yet. We're not adding a batch number yet.

999
01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:53.900
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay, yeah.

1000
01:35:54.090 --> 01:36:01.649
Anthony Taylor: So we will see. We'll work our way through that. What the heck just happened there.

1001
01:36:02.990 --> 01:36:10.660
Anthony Taylor: My fingers went in the wrong place. X process. Y processed. Yes.

1002
01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:17.260
Anthony Taylor: Oh, my God, I did it again. I don't know what I'm touching here. That's doing that.

1003
01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:32.079
Anthony Taylor: Okay. alright. So that cell ran alright. So here I'm definitely gonna copy and paste, because this is all of the actual augmenting

1004
01:36:32.850 --> 01:36:36.480
Anthony Taylor: that we will have to do. And it's a lot.

1005
01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:39.999
Anthony Taylor: So I'm gonna copy and paste that whole cell.

1006
01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:45.589
Anthony Taylor: So this is that image data generator. If you guys remember

1007
01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:47.490
Anthony Taylor: when we cover this

1008
01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:59.220
Dipinto, Matt: to be personity for a moment. So if you look at you know, whatever line 25 of that

1009
01:36:59.330 --> 01:37:05.290
Dipinto, Matt: we do do, the expand dims in this next cell, why wouldn't we just do it.

1010
01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:12.970
Dipinto, Matt: So you see, why wouldn't we do it in the first loop and keep this one actually to do

1011
01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:17.149
Dipinto, Matt: image generation rather than like convoluting the 2 together.

1012
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:24.540
Dipinto, Matt: Anyway, whatever it's, it's fine. Yeah, I'm I'm looking to see if maybe they explained why they did that stand by.

1013
01:37:25.490 --> 01:37:30.960
Clayton Graves: But I think this this next cell, Meredith? Question right?

1014
01:37:31.090 --> 01:37:33.919
Clayton Graves: Because there you're augmenting. You're augmenting

1015
01:37:34.350 --> 01:37:37.459
Clayton Graves: the X train and the Y train this time around.

1016
01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:40.240
Anthony Taylor: Correct

1017
01:37:43.310 --> 01:37:46.939
Anthony Taylor: like, I said, I'm looking to see if there's a

1018
01:37:51.290 --> 01:37:54.670
Anthony Taylor: an explanation as to why they chose to do it that way.

1019
01:37:57.260 --> 01:37:58.580
Anthony Taylor: I just want to look

1020
01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:01.059
Anthony Taylor: here. We go.

1021
01:38:02.260 --> 01:38:11.200
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we encoded Y move on working with X data for a bit. In particular, we want to augment the images to increase the size of our training set.

1022
01:38:13.810 --> 01:38:16.810
Anthony Taylor: Now it's time to augment the images. No.

1023
01:38:19.250 --> 01:38:23.840
Anthony Taylor: it I agree. II agree with you, Matt. That's a good good point.

1024
01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:30.659
Anthony Taylor: It doesn't make a ton of sense. Why. they didn't just do that all in the same way.

1025
01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:48.530
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Well, let's walk through this and talk about all the things. So this same as what we did the other day. It's really just a whole bunch of different augmentations. Remember, this is like a range.

1026
01:38:48.670 --> 01:38:53.539
Anthony Taylor: So it's not gonna do 20 degrees every single time it could be anything between

1027
01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:55.499
Anthony Taylor: one in 20 degrees.

1028
01:38:55.800 --> 01:39:01.760
Anthony Taylor: So do all that. Here's our X-train augmented empty list.

1029
01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:05.290
Anthony Taylor: Our Y train augmented data frame.

1030
01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:13.349
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to say, Okay, go through each one of these. assign the image. assign the label

1031
01:39:13.970 --> 01:39:18.650
Anthony Taylor:  expand the dim. So this is where it puts the one in front.

1032
01:39:20.140 --> 01:39:30.700
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so now we have one comma, 64, 60 comma one and this is what Matt was talking about. It's like, why, why would we just do that there?

1033
01:39:30.850 --> 01:39:34.890
Anthony Taylor: I don't see a reason why we wouldn't. So

1034
01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:41.280
Anthony Taylor: we can go gripe it to develop the original one.

1035
01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:44.109
Dipinto, Matt: You mean chat uppity.

1036
01:39:45.090 --> 01:39:53.759
Anthony Taylor: I don't think chat TV wrote this. I don't know. I don't know who wrote these. I would say, probably not legally. I don't think they were allowed to use it.

1037
01:39:55.200 --> 01:40:02.540
Anthony Taylor:  My understanding at least the way it was when I was on the curriculum team. As a consultant

1038
01:40:02.710 --> 01:40:14.170
Anthony Taylor: we would usually write out a lot of this stuff, but a lot of it also gets  I mean, you know, they find examples, or they come up with examples and

1039
01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:22.419
Anthony Taylor: ask the consultant to review them, and then and and again. as a consultant would. I have noticed this?

1040
01:40:23.310 --> 01:40:25.780
Anthony Taylor: Maybe maybe not. I don't know

1041
01:40:25.890 --> 01:40:31.810
Anthony Taylor: it's hard to say they they usually want us to to review it as quickly as possible.

1042
01:40:31.890 --> 01:40:33.590
Anthony Taylor: Does it work? Yeah.

1043
01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:35.840
Anthony Taylor: Thumbs up

1044
01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:37.320
so

1045
01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:39.960
Anthony Taylor: because they pay us a lot be consulted.

1046
01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:45.420
Anthony Taylor:  all right. So where are we? Okay?

1047
01:40:45.530 --> 01:41:02.529
Anthony Taylor: So here we're going to add 5 new images to each one, basically just going to go through and apply one or more of these augments to an image and then save it to the list. And when we're all done we'll get a new link.

1048
01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:07.679
Anthony Taylor: The one thing we really want to see is that the length of X train and length of Y train are the same.

1049
01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:10.470
Anthony Taylor: They are so so far.

1050
01:41:10.510 --> 01:41:11.830
Anthony Taylor: so good.

1051
01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:18.460
Anthony Taylor:  next, we're gonna convert

1052
01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:22.290
Anthony Taylor: our data to a single arrays.

1053
01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:26.119
Anthony Taylor: So I'm gonna bring. Oh, I can type.

1054
01:41:26.650 --> 01:41:31.189
Anthony Taylor: I can type it. I get lazy, and I'm like, I don't want to type.

1055
01:41:32.490 --> 01:41:36.419
Clayton Graves: But you said you were gonna convert it to a single array, but it looks like.

1056
01:41:36.770 --> 01:41:41.919
Clayton Graves: well, it's not gonna be one array. Each one will be an array, I guess. I should say.

1057
01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:47.539
Anthony Taylor: yeah, sorry you are correct. Not a single array of the whole thing

1058
01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:51.080
Anthony Taylor: single. That's that's wrong, right? There's wrong

1059
01:41:53.130 --> 01:41:58.229
Anthony Taylor: underscore. And then same for tests

1060
01:42:00.370 --> 01:42:04.830
Anthony Taylor: equals. Np, array

1061
01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:07.900
Anthony Taylor: tests.

1062
01:42:10.170 --> 01:42:13.760
Anthony Taylor: And we can take a look. The shape

1063
01:42:20.930 --> 01:42:28.569
Anthony Taylor: that's good enough. Okay, so 2,364, one. Yay. we're looking good.

1064
01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:32.420
Anthony Taylor: Okay? All right.

1065
01:42:36.580 --> 01:42:40.100
Anthony Taylor: let's take a look at why, underscore train

1066
01:42:42.690 --> 01:42:44.320
Anthony Taylor: ahead.

1067
01:42:46.710 --> 01:42:48.290
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Not sure what?

1068
01:42:48.440 --> 01:43:00.190
Anthony Taylor: Oh, okay. Now, we have all the wide view to format correctly need to divide it back into sets of columns that can be predicted by a single layer. For instance, user Id columns should be together.

1069
01:43:00.540 --> 01:43:01.380
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1070
01:43:01.870 --> 01:43:19.689
Anthony Taylor: it's perfectly reasonable to gather all one hot encoded inputs with original columns back together. For example, we gather all the augmented data for pose in its own data frame to do the same. So if we have separate data frames for each of the target variables. How many Y variables will we be working with?

1071
01:43:26.650 --> 01:43:29.689
Anthony Taylor: So of all the different ones we did, how many different?

1072
01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:32.050
Anthony Taylor: Why, variables do we have?

1073
01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:44.999
Anthony Taylor: I'll give you a hint if you want to look. Go all the way back up to where we were doing those same things over and over again. How many times did we do those things over and over again?

1074
01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:46.650
Anthony Taylor: 4.

1075
01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:52.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we have 4 different ones, user, id expression, pose ice

1076
01:43:53.130 --> 01:43:58.079
Anthony Taylor: alright! How many branches will our architecture have?

1077
01:43:59.330 --> 01:44:02.230
Anthony Taylor: And the branches are after the hidden layers?

1078
01:44:06.190 --> 01:44:11.849
Clayton Graves: Well, you're gonna need one for each each one. Right? So so or again.

1079
01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.310
Anthony Taylor: yeah, 4 is correct.

1080
01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:16.050
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So which

1081
01:44:16.140 --> 01:44:18.790
Anthony Taylor: activation function

1082
01:44:19.340 --> 01:44:21.689
Anthony Taylor: can we apply to each branch?

1083
01:44:24.310 --> 01:44:25.620
Softmax?

1084
01:44:26.820 --> 01:44:27.510
And

1085
01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:33.019
Anthony Taylor: here's the good news. Your answer is not wrong.

1086
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:42.180
Anthony Taylor: Okay, the way that we're going to handle this, we can actually apply either to some of them.

1087
01:44:42.250 --> 01:44:46.079
Anthony Taylor: like the only one that for sure is sigmoid is the eyes?

1088
01:44:46.110 --> 01:44:56.619
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, was the eyes. Well, that one's there's no question. Okay, but we're going to actually use sigmoid on all of these, and it'll be fine, because each one is a separate

1089
01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:01.279
Anthony Taylor: variable. That is, gonna that it'll work. It'll work that way.

1090
01:45:01.710 --> 01:45:10.470
Anthony Taylor:  where do we expect the output to look like. So if we use sigmoid, go ahead

1091
01:45:10.810 --> 01:45:12.230
Clayton Graves: only has

1092
01:45:12.370 --> 01:45:17.790
Clayton Graves: one of 2 possible variables, one or 0 correct, each column correct.

1093
01:45:18.870 --> 01:45:23.350
Clayton Graves: So then that explains why we wouldn't need to use

1094
01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:25.060
Clayton Graves: the software

1095
01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:28.860
Clayton Graves: because you can't be both one and 0.

1096
01:45:29.590 --> 01:45:32.830
Anthony Taylor: Well, all right. Well, hold on to that. Hold on to that thought.

1097
01:45:32.930 --> 01:45:33.810
Anthony Taylor: So

1098
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:40.099
Anthony Taylor: if we use sigmoid, what do we expect? So let's just look at the eyes. One. We have 2 possibilities.

1099
01:45:40.250 --> 01:45:43.959
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if we use sigmoid. what would we expect to see

1100
01:45:47.050 --> 01:45:49.180
Meredith McCanse (she/her): either classes or without.

1101
01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:53.259
Anthony Taylor: But what would it come out as go ahead, Meredith?

1102
01:45:55.490 --> 01:45:59.529
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Oh, I was gonna say the same thing, Playton, said I, one or 0, I guess.

1103
01:45:59.970 --> 01:46:09.929
Anthony Taylor: Well, right. It would be a probability between 0 and one with one being. They're wearing sunglasses

1104
01:46:10.070 --> 01:46:13.789
Anthony Taylor: and 0 being they're you can see their eyes.

1105
01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:23.609
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so it would be a probability between the 2, the models not going to be perfect every time. It's gonna say, well, it's like 83% chance. They got sunglasses.

1106
01:46:24.990 --> 01:46:29.149
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then that's gonna round up one. And you're gonna get sunglasses.

1107
01:46:29.310 --> 01:46:34.589
Anthony Taylor: Now, what? It would be an advantage of using softmax instead of sigmoid.

1108
01:46:35.110 --> 01:46:39.670
Anthony Taylor: In some of these. let's use user Id as an example.

1109
01:46:50.490 --> 01:46:58.690
Baro, Sonja: Is that the case where we've augmented the picture, and something might have changed, or or maybe we added a whole new picture

1110
01:46:58.900 --> 01:47:03.690
Baro, Sonja: right? Cause there's so if there's more pictures of the same person.

1111
01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:06.749
Baro, Sonja: that's when you would want to use Softmax.

1112
01:47:07.740 --> 01:47:14.489
Anthony Taylor: Well, let's say, let's just say, how about a new person complete.

1113
01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:29.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so consider this. If if if we you later use this model with sigmoid, all predictions would be forced to one, even if the model was certain that the new image didn't belong to any of the original faces.

1114
01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:39.560
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so it would. It could be completely wrong, because it's a whole new image, but they all are pointing to whatever one indicates.

1115
01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:49.150
Anthony Taylor: All right with the Softmax, you would get a probability of what this is, and and that probability could be very, very low.

1116
01:47:49.170 --> 01:47:53.720
Anthony Taylor: but it would be a probability of all of the images which one is this one most similar to.

1117
01:47:54.640 --> 01:48:00.099
Anthony Taylor: So if all of them, it's not similar to any of them, it's just going to come back with a very low probability.

1118
01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:01.230
Anthony Taylor: all of it.

1119
01:48:02.290 --> 01:48:04.820
Anthony Taylor: Okay. so that's

1120
01:48:04.900 --> 01:48:14.400
Anthony Taylor: this is another one of those like tunable moments. Right? We're going to use sigmoid. And all of them. Is it ideal? Not necessarily. But

1121
01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:20.419
Anthony Taylor: it's it's like. Again, you could go and flip this switch and try different things

1122
01:48:20.530 --> 01:48:22.349
Anthony Taylor: to get different results.

1123
01:48:22.870 --> 01:48:26.940
Clayton Graves: We are using multiple columns right?

1124
01:48:27.310 --> 01:48:30.210
Clayton Graves: And that was that was one of the things that

1125
01:48:30.500 --> 01:48:34.590
Anthony Taylor: one of the things you would consider absolutely absolutely.

1126
01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:43.549
Baro, Sonja: Is there a high resource draw from sick Softmax, or there is Softmax is definitely higher than signal.

1127
01:48:43.650 --> 01:48:49.329
Baro, Sonja: But you I mean you could eat honestly, though I don't know that it would be enough to get all freaky about.

1128
01:48:49.370 --> 01:48:58.649
Anthony Taylor: I mean, you're probably would be fine using using either one. And I mean we could even go as far as to try it.

1129
01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:03.499
Anthony Taylor: But first let's continue. Let's just go with this the way this one is for now

1130
01:49:05.980 --> 01:49:12.590
Anthony Taylor: and then we'll talk more about it. So here we go. So here's the next cell. It's quite elaborate.

1131
01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:17.670
Anthony Taylor: This is this cell. Here.

1132
01:49:19.610 --> 01:49:29.889
Anthony Taylor: Alright, let's go through all of this. So here we're gonna take the Y, so basically, all we're gonna do is get our Y variables for each of the columns. Okay.

1133
01:49:29.950 --> 01:49:31.929
Anthony Taylor: that's that's our goal here.

1134
01:49:32.310 --> 01:49:36.460
Anthony Taylor: So we have our wide train user. Id, we're going to get it from Aug.

1135
01:49:36.650 --> 01:49:43.550
Anthony Taylor: and we're just going to basically grab user, id, impose, then expression, then, eyes.

1136
01:49:44.020 --> 01:49:45.080
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1137
01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:54.550
Anthony Taylor: and now repeat all 4 selections with the Why did Y testing so this did it with the train. This did it with the tests. Run it.

1138
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:56.750
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

1139
01:49:57.270 --> 01:50:03.860
Anthony Taylor: okay, we can look at just one of our data frames. Let's look at head pose.

1140
01:50:04.230 --> 01:50:06.420
Anthony Taylor: So I train.

1141
01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:14.479
Anthony Taylor: And there we go.

1142
01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:25.829
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we can see, we got some cool stuff all right. So we're actually, gonna we're actually not going to continue this. We're going to stop right here by pickling out our data.

1143
01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:30.599
Anthony Taylor: Now, I'm gonna grab. I'm gonna again. I'm just gonna copy this. This is another

1144
01:50:31.060 --> 01:50:32.580
Anthony Taylor: lot of stuff here.

1145
01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:36.399
Anthony Taylor: You guys, of course, can see it already.

1146
01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:39.909
Anthony Taylor: But I still gonna give it to you.

1147
01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:44.400
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

1148
01:50:44.450 --> 01:50:56.269
Anthony Taylor: They actually gave us quite a bit of this, but we'll still there we go, all right. So what do we got? Well, we've got a dictionary of all of our different

1149
01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:57.900
Anthony Taylor: data sets.

1150
01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:07.440
Anthony Taylor: Then we're gonna connect to Google, Colab, mount our drive and then write it to our mounted drive. So we'll run this

1151
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:11.269
Anthony Taylor: connect to Google. Drive. Go ahead.

1152
01:51:12.490 --> 01:51:13.570
Anthony Taylor: go ahead.

1153
01:51:14.740 --> 01:51:15.930
Anthony Taylor: go ahead

1154
01:51:17.140 --> 01:51:22.029
Anthony Taylor: eventually. It'll go now. It's going to put all that data in here.

1155
01:51:46.690 --> 01:51:49.209
Anthony Taylor: and it's done. So let's check and see if it worked

1156
01:51:49.330 --> 01:51:51.810
Anthony Taylor: 5 microt.

1157
01:51:52.690 --> 01:51:55.460
Anthony Taylor: And we're looking for preprocessed faces.

1158
01:51:56.730 --> 01:51:57.850
Anthony Taylor: And there they are.

1159
01:51:58.830 --> 01:52:01.649
Anthony Taylor: Okay, pretty exciting.

1160
01:52:01.780 --> 01:52:03.990
Anthony Taylor: All our data is preprocessed.

1161
01:52:04.990 --> 01:52:07.079
Anthony Taylor: And we're not done yet.

1162
01:52:08.470 --> 01:52:15.179
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I'm hoping I have some pictures. So yeah, so let's talk about

1163
01:52:15.510 --> 01:52:18.920
Anthony Taylor: some challenge. Well, first, before I leave that any questions

1164
01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:24.550
Anthony Taylor: think we were kind of addressing questions as we went. Everyone's pretty okay with what we just did.

1165
01:52:25.020 --> 01:52:26.500
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I

1166
01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:36.240
Anthony Taylor: the bottom. I remember guys and I, we've been saying this. I don't know. Probably the whole boot camp preprocessing is most of the work. Okay.

1167
01:52:36.750 --> 01:52:46.220
Anthony Taylor: feel free to go through that code. Understand? It's I don't know that there's a lot that is weird activation functions are iffy. But

1168
01:52:47.010 --> 01:52:51.779
Anthony Taylor: I think you're gonna be fine with that. Okay, you could try different ones

1169
01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:55.069
Anthony Taylor: for different purposes. But if you stick to the rules

1170
01:52:56.120 --> 01:53:00.949
Anthony Taylor: which we just told you, we're not. Gonna but if we stick to the rules, you should be okay.

1171
01:53:01.140 --> 01:53:03.419
Anthony Taylor: So some of the challenges with image data.

1172
01:53:03.670 --> 01:53:08.839
Anthony Taylor: Okay, probably one of the most

1173
01:53:09.150 --> 01:53:15.360
Anthony Taylor: pain and the butt challenges is noisy images. Okay?

1174
01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:24.030
Anthony Taylor: and this, you know, a lot of this can come from how the pictures were taken. So older smartphones are very noisy.

1175
01:53:24.430 --> 01:53:28.239
Anthony Taylor:  Anything in the background

1176
01:53:28.260 --> 01:53:29.569
Anthony Taylor: can mess you up.

1177
01:53:29.810 --> 01:53:33.979
Anthony Taylor: You have pictures with photos behind you, I mean.

1178
01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:40.080
Anthony Taylor: like, if Clayton brought his dog up on the screen and we took picture with all that noise behind him.

1179
01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:49.750
Anthony Taylor: Meredith, all her oranges. Oh, my goodness. okay, my area even is pretty pretty cluttered in the back.

1180
01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:56.320
Anthony Taylor: So you know, these kind of things will definitely make it difficult.

1181
01:53:56.590 --> 01:54:00.030
Anthony Taylor: Believe it or not. There are ways to deal with it. In fact.

1182
01:54:01.310 --> 01:54:03.539
Anthony Taylor: I just want to see something.

1183
01:54:05.670 --> 01:54:08.150
Anthony Taylor: II used to have this great

1184
01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:10.180
Anthony Taylor: example.

1185
01:54:11.590 --> 01:54:13.459
Anthony Taylor: I think it was these guys.

1186
01:54:14.620 --> 01:54:16.209
Anthony Taylor: and it showed

1187
01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:24.730
Anthony Taylor: what's happening with the image itself. That's not it. Darn it.

1188
01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:28.750
Anthony Taylor: I'm not gonna spend too long looking for this, but I was hoping.

1189
01:54:29.850 --> 01:54:31.310
Anthony Taylor: hoping.

1190
01:54:33.610 --> 01:54:40.449
Baro, Sonja: I think you referenced this when we were doing Cnn. The that there was an image that you had

1191
01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:41.950
Anthony Taylor: right.

1192
01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:53.939
Anthony Taylor: There's there's I mean, as you can see. Cnn is very, very poppy.

1193
01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:57.959
Anthony Taylor: There is a ton. This looks right.

1194
01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:02.520
Anthony Taylor: I wonder if they have it blown up, though?

1195
01:55:08.790 --> 01:55:11.719
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, little bit. Let's see, they got more. But

1196
01:55:14.350 --> 01:55:18.949
Anthony Taylor: so basically, what's happening with the filters. This is a small example.

1197
01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:23.039
Anthony Taylor: Well, this is this is AI, that's

1198
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:27.339
Anthony Taylor: that. And and I don't want to explain that right now.

1199
01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:33.240
Anthony Taylor: We'll explain that later. If we don't remind me to explain that to you later. How? A picture is generated

1200
01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:34.890
Anthony Taylor: through AI.

1201
01:55:36.250 --> 01:55:37.210
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1202
01:55:37.310 --> 01:55:43.820
Anthony Taylor: so this is the closest I'm going to find. I think so basically, what's happening with each

1203
01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:49.870
Anthony Taylor: filter. So like earlier, remember, when we did the Cnn, we said, 32 filters.

1204
01:55:50.050 --> 01:56:05.879
Anthony Taylor: each filter is basically identifying something else within the picture, and then based on the kernel that we pass it. Remember, one did like horizontal lines. One did vertical lines, one did blur, one did this, all these different things get identified

1205
01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:17.540
Anthony Taylor: as the convolutions continue. and as they go through it, it basically. I mean, imagine, if you took the picture and said, Alright, let's look at it with one eye.

1206
01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:20.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay, let's look at it with other.

1207
01:56:21.150 --> 01:56:23.710
Anthony Taylor: Now let's put 3D glasses on.

1208
01:56:24.090 --> 01:56:29.169
Anthony Taylor: Now let's put you know, sunglasses on. Now turn it this way, turn it that.

1209
01:56:29.540 --> 01:56:43.329
Anthony Taylor: whatever the more different ways you look at it, the easier it is for you to identify. Or remember. the model is basically training that way. It's trying to find it's basically trying to understand the detail

1210
01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:53.429
Anthony Taylor: via the numbers, because realize it's just a bunch of floats right? So it's trying to understand the details that are in front of it. And to do that, it basically

1211
01:56:53.610 --> 01:56:55.200
Anthony Taylor: like tries to do.

1212
01:56:55.700 --> 01:57:06.039
Anthony Taylor: You know what kind of this is? What it makes you think of, do you guys ever? And and I don't know. Maybe this is like some silly kid thing. But like, if you're ever looking to something, do you ever intentionally

1213
01:57:06.130 --> 01:57:07.600
Anthony Taylor: get out of focus

1214
01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:15.969
Anthony Taylor: like you look at something, and then you like, you know, like, try to look past it or look closer, whatever. And it's almost like you're looking

1215
01:57:16.210 --> 01:57:18.090
Anthony Taylor: at different layers.

1216
01:57:18.290 --> 01:57:22.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Or here's another great example.

1217
01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:29.389
Anthony Taylor: When you take a picture on your phone with portrait. Move right? That for that picture looks 3D. Doesn't.

1218
01:57:29.560 --> 01:57:37.369
Anthony Taylor: It? Looks like you can see another layer is behind the the the main feature of the photo. Well, think like that.

1219
01:57:37.450 --> 01:57:42.930
Anthony Taylor: It's basically trying to cut that photo into layers with different filters

1220
01:57:43.240 --> 01:57:50.410
Anthony Taylor: to come up with what the features of this the details of the picture are. So there are some great Cnn

1221
01:57:50.450 --> 01:57:53.739
Anthony Taylor: documentation out there. It's incredibly popular.

1222
01:57:53.850 --> 01:57:59.580
Anthony Taylor: and it's kind of key to the whole stable diffusion and

1223
01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:04.109
Anthony Taylor: mid journey, and Dolly 3 for image generation.

1224
01:58:04.750 --> 01:58:08.880
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So. And we will talk about some of that stuff anyway.

1225
01:58:08.970 --> 01:58:13.749
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so noisy images. it's just hard to deal with.

1226
01:58:14.030 --> 01:58:17.920
Anthony Taylor: all right, especially other things. Compression.

1227
01:58:19.170 --> 01:58:23.240
Anthony Taylor: compression. What's compression? Are pictures always compress.

1228
01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:25.680
Anthony Taylor: are never compressed.

1229
01:58:30.750 --> 01:58:32.560
Anthony Taylor: Any photographers in the room.

1230
01:58:34.540 --> 01:58:36.210
Dipinto, Matt: sometimes compressed.

1231
01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:42.610
Dipinto, Matt: Sometimes I mean, you can take it in a prop format that wouldn't be compressed.

1232
01:58:42.740 --> 01:58:55.099
Anthony Taylor: So most photographers take pictures in a raw okay, which is dot raw. right? Most of you probably have never seen a dot raw photo. It doesn't look any different than a Jpeg.

1233
01:58:55.610 --> 01:59:04.270
Anthony Taylor: at least to the naked eye. The difference with a dot raw is that we can apply filters to it, or or change photo settings

1234
01:59:04.300 --> 01:59:05.579
after the fact.

1235
01:59:06.060 --> 01:59:07.429
Anthony Taylor: To say, you want

1236
01:59:08.590 --> 01:59:10.410
Anthony Taylor: to change the f-stop.

1237
01:59:10.700 --> 01:59:16.629
Anthony Taylor: If you have a raw photo taken with a digital camera, you can actually change the f-stop after that

1238
01:59:17.150 --> 01:59:23.060
Anthony Taylor: kind of interesting little tidbits. Well, those are pretty much only uncompressed images.

1239
01:59:23.570 --> 01:59:29.600
Anthony Taylor: Jpeg. Compressed. Get a press, P. And G. Compress.

1240
01:59:30.440 --> 01:59:43.090
Anthony Taylor: Now the level to which the compression is is dependent on how you have it set up. If you ever use Photoshop and you go to save a picture like export as Jpeg, it will ask you.

1241
01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:45.249
Anthony Taylor: how good quality do you want?

1242
01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:48.500
Anthony Taylor: And that means, how compressed do you want this?

1243
01:59:49.930 --> 01:59:55.059
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So that also creates noise, alright variation?

1244
01:59:55.150 --> 02:00:13.940
Anthony Taylor:  so Cnids are great at recognizing patterns and data sets, especially large ones. Lots of inputs. Okay, when there's less variety, though, it's easier for this model to identify

1245
02:00:14.930 --> 02:00:16.210
Anthony Taylor: it's

1246
02:00:19.660 --> 02:00:23.340
Anthony Taylor: well, I mean with normalization, it makes it easier.

1247
02:00:23.910 --> 02:00:35.050
Anthony Taylor: But the variations are just a problem. Okay, so say, for instance, we have a database of flowering plant images, and we classify them as either fruiting or non-fruiting.

1248
02:00:35.180 --> 02:00:43.899
Anthony Taylor: The non fruiting plants can include dandelions, roses, lilies, although they all belong to the same class. Their flowers are very different

1249
02:00:44.060 --> 02:00:48.829
Anthony Taylor: appearance. This is an intra class barrier. So

1250
02:00:49.980 --> 02:00:58.070
Anthony Taylor: I mean, you know, II remember this. This didn't used to be flowers. But yeah, so think about. If you have flowering fruits

1251
02:00:58.470 --> 02:01:10.410
Anthony Taylor: right? And you're looking at flowers and trying to determine which one is what is, is a fruit and which one is not, I mean. flowering fruits can be practically any color and any shape

1252
02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:17.060
Anthony Taylor: and non flowering fruits. Fruits can also be practically any color, any shape.

1253
02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:21.310
Anthony Taylor: So it does complicate things when you're trying to do image classification.

1254
02:01:21.500 --> 02:01:29.540
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So that's something. Keep in mind the last thing about Cnn's that we'll talk about before sending you off to do. Your activity

1255
02:01:29.660 --> 02:01:32.660
Anthony Taylor: is computational expense.

1256
02:01:32.700 --> 02:01:34.220
Anthony Taylor: You can imagine.

1257
02:01:34.270 --> 02:01:38.549
Anthony Taylor: If it's got to take this giant picture, cut it into

1258
02:01:39.710 --> 02:01:49.690
Anthony Taylor: potentially thousands of more little blocks and then process. Oh, and we're gonna apply a filter to every one of those blocks.

1259
02:01:50.700 --> 02:02:04.110
Anthony Taylor: I mean, this is gonna be very computationally intense. But keep climates only the training. Remember what I always tell you guys, the training is computationally expensive, actually using it typically is not

1260
02:02:05.790 --> 02:02:07.750
Anthony Taylor: so Amazon

1261
02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:09.939
Anthony Taylor: azure. Google.

1262
02:02:09.970 --> 02:02:16.819
Anthony Taylor: they all have. You can pre-buy. You can use their trained vision models.

1263
02:02:17.150 --> 02:02:19.350
Anthony Taylor: and they are ridiculous.

1264
02:02:19.530 --> 02:02:25.980
Anthony Taylor: I can take and and and and between Meredith and Clayton I'm not sure who has a more complicated background.

1265
02:02:26.370 --> 02:02:28.000
Anthony Taylor: Okay? But

1266
02:02:28.010 --> 02:02:35.219
Anthony Taylor: I could take. Let's use Clayton Clayton's background. Put it into these these models we can buy

1267
02:02:35.390 --> 02:02:42.020
Anthony Taylor: and just take his picture boom, say, identify it, will pick up every single thing

1268
02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:45.990
Anthony Taylor: in his picture and tell me what it is

1269
02:02:47.390 --> 02:02:51.530
Anthony Taylor: without any training that's already been trained. It's ready to go.

1270
02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:54.139
Anthony Taylor: and it'll cost me about a nickel.

1271
02:02:56.210 --> 02:03:02.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Because most people don't process one image. They process 1 million a thousand.

1272
02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:07.009
Anthony Taylor: though the cloud services make good money on this.

1273
02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:13.629
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Last, but not least. you guys are going to finish what we started

1274
02:03:14.060 --> 02:03:17.170
Anthony Taylor: do it in Google colab.

1275
02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:30.980
Anthony Taylor: But but but but, please. I did not give you the solution. the good news is all you got to do. Is that model? Build and branches.

1276
02:03:31.070 --> 02:03:36.220
Anthony Taylor: And this is all like what I showed you earlier. So it's not really that difficult train it.

1277
02:03:36.630 --> 02:03:43.540
Anthony Taylor: and it has the evaluate there. It's all you got to do you actually have. I'm going to give you all 20 min

1278
02:03:44.250 --> 02:03:49.779
Anthony Taylor: to do this. and if you get done way early.

1279
02:03:50.370 --> 02:03:54.090
Anthony Taylor: come on back. If not feel free to take the whole 20 min.

1280
02:03:55.220 --> 02:03:57.660
Anthony Taylor: Alright!

1281
02:03:57.800 --> 02:04:00.820
Anthony Taylor: How did everybody do? Did we get through? It

1282
02:04:01.210 --> 02:04:03.870
Clayton Graves: mostly was 20 min enough.

1283
02:04:03.890 --> 02:04:05.670
Meredith McCanse (she/her): We did not get through it.

1284
02:04:05.950 --> 02:04:10.919
Anthony Taylor: I feel bad. Cause II mean, I was like it was 25 min. But I thought.

1285
02:04:11.210 --> 02:04:13.470
Anthony Taylor: for sure, you guys will be okay

1286
02:04:14.990 --> 02:04:16.130
Anthony Taylor: with 20 min.

1287
02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:25.990
Baro, Sonja: You're okay to find what you're looking to reference and all that. So I definitely can follow you on that.

1288
02:04:26.270 --> 02:04:30.520
Baro, Sonja: Alright. So let me go on and bring in the solution.

1289
02:04:32.110 --> 02:04:35.570
Anthony Taylor: I gotta. I gotta tell you guys I am so excited.

1290
02:04:36.470 --> 02:04:37.350
Anthony Taylor: So

1291
02:04:38.500 --> 02:04:43.560
Anthony Taylor: I I've been telling you for a while now that some of the later parts of the curriculum.

1292
02:04:43.630 --> 02:04:45.530
Anthony Taylor: you know, weren't complete

1293
02:04:46.100 --> 02:04:51.860
Anthony Taylor: right? And I was waiting to see where they were. Gonna be? Well, they're all done. I was just reviewing them.

1294
02:04:53.390 --> 02:04:54.570
Anthony Taylor: Hell, yeah.

1295
02:04:56.570 --> 02:04:57.810
Anthony Taylor: it's good.

1296
02:04:58.280 --> 02:04:59.550
Anthony Taylor: really good.

1297
02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:05.550
Anthony Taylor: Alright, you guys, starting tomorrow to Wednesday.

1298
02:05:05.710 --> 02:05:08.110
Anthony Taylor: it's all fun stuff

1299
02:05:09.610 --> 02:05:11.110
Anthony Taylor: like all fun stuff

1300
02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:14.740
Anthony Taylor: does that work for you guys, you guys want fun stuff

1301
02:05:16.050 --> 02:05:22.610
Clayton Graves: having you been saying every week everything is fine. Clayton, stop it.

1302
02:05:24.300 --> 02:05:27.329
Anthony Taylor: So you're right. But seriously.

1303
02:05:28.380 --> 02:05:33.130
Anthony Taylor: I mean, how many of you guys signed up with this thinking you were gonna learn, chat, gpt the whole time.

1304
02:05:33.570 --> 02:05:49.450
Anthony Taylor: Huh? How many when you signed up? Oh, it's AI. You think you're just gonna be using it the whole time, right? But that's what that's that's I. And I knew that I knew that from day one. So it drove me

1305
02:05:49.500 --> 02:05:52.990
Clayton Graves: no complaints. I have nothing to complain about.

1306
02:05:53.920 --> 02:05:58.959
Anthony Taylor: and I appreciate that, and I'll be honest with you. You need it all at all. Most of what you've got.

1307
02:05:59.140 --> 02:06:10.350
Anthony Taylor: You needed it really to to say, you know, to understand AI in general. But starting Wednesday, we're gonna start natural language processing. And from that point on.

1308
02:06:10.490 --> 02:06:14.859
Anthony Taylor: you're basically getting the foundations and the understanding of how to create

1309
02:06:15.660 --> 02:06:17.630
chat applications

1310
02:06:17.720 --> 02:06:23.350
Anthony Taylor: using. And they even have you get an opening. I, Api almost fell over. I'm like what

1311
02:06:23.500 --> 02:06:28.930
Anthony Taylor: I can't believe they did that. So that open AI Api, you guys got for the extra review.

1312
02:06:30.450 --> 02:06:31.790
Anthony Taylor: You're going to end up using.

1313
02:06:31.800 --> 02:06:37.380
Anthony Taylor: Okay, anyway. Sorry. I don't know how much they gave you, so we'll go through us. We did our pickle.

1314
02:06:37.620 --> 02:06:40.829
Anthony Taylor: We're going to assign our variables

1315
02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:43.449
Anthony Taylor: from the data in our pickle.

1316
02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:45.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

1317
02:06:45.980 --> 02:06:52.039
Anthony Taylor: And then we're gonna build our model. So I know this is where we started. So your input layer

1318
02:06:52.440 --> 02:06:56.629
Anthony Taylor: I you know what. I bet you, if I would have gave you this, you guys probably would have figured out the best of the.

1319
02:06:59.630 --> 02:07:04.469
Anthony Taylor: And that's like, yeah, probably maybe no. The big thing here was this shape.

1320
02:07:04.980 --> 02:07:09.110
Anthony Taylor: right? Big thing. Here was this shit. But

1321
02:07:09.350 --> 02:07:15.600
Anthony Taylor: this record. We have done this exact same shape before the same input layer. Just

1322
02:07:15.720 --> 02:07:19.090
Anthony Taylor: because, remember, we didn't have all the cool.

1323
02:07:19.220 --> 02:07:27.239
Anthony Taylor: naming things and stuff right? Because we were doing it, men. But so this is actually from the same one we did.

1324
02:07:27.710 --> 02:07:35.689
Anthony Taylor: I want to say Thursday. maybe Wednesday. This should have came right out of there

1325
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:39.769
Anthony Taylor: right? So we did the all of these, and then we have this

1326
02:07:39.960 --> 02:07:44.150
Anthony Taylor: shared layers. So this is our first shared layer.

1327
02:07:45.600 --> 02:07:56.599
Anthony Taylor: Once we have that now we just need to do. And this is interesting. And I guess, did they actually say, to do this? Build the branches, include a density layer

1328
02:07:57.720 --> 02:07:59.260
Anthony Taylor: and then an output link.

1329
02:07:59.700 --> 02:08:02.900
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So this perspective visual.

1330
02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:05.480
Anthony Taylor: Okay? You mean with the directions.

1331
02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:09.849
michael mcpherson: okay? Good. Okay. Yeah. The directions were not.

1332
02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:20.960
Anthony Taylor: So there's your dead slayer, same as before, and it sources the last one of our right before or right after our flatmate.

1333
02:08:21.380 --> 02:08:26.949
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then we have our output. We said we would use sigmoid on all of them.

1334
02:08:27.150 --> 02:08:31.599
Anthony Taylor: And notice they all refer back to dense shared.

1335
02:08:33.990 --> 02:08:40.699
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So each of these branches refer back to here. Each of these branches have a hidden layer.

1336
02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:46.960
Anthony Taylor: The only one that we oh, you know what we did use softmax here, and softmax here, which is a good choice

1337
02:08:46.970 --> 02:08:48.859
Anthony Taylor: cause. They had multiple columns.

1338
02:08:49.320 --> 02:08:51.459
Anthony Taylor: Okay,

1339
02:08:51.690 --> 02:08:54.650
Anthony Taylor: did I run that cell? I don't know. We'll run it again.

1340
02:08:55.130 --> 02:08:58.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then, once we have that, we can build the model out

1341
02:08:58.890 --> 02:09:05.789
Anthony Taylor: and compile it, and got all this garbage to put in there. It's not garbage, it's important, but it's a lot

1342
02:09:06.020 --> 02:09:07.979
Anthony Taylor: alright, and then we can train it.

1343
02:09:10.810 --> 02:09:14.339
Anthony Taylor: This will probably take a second to train, because there's a lot of stuff going on.

1344
02:09:18.500 --> 02:09:28.819
Anthony Taylor: and then when it's done, we'll get our our stuff. But the most important thing here is to understand how we built these layers. So we'll let the training go. You guys can do model that fit, probably blindfolded. Now.

1345
02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:32.010
Anthony Taylor: so this is our Cnn.

1346
02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:38.180
Anthony Taylor: remember this. This is again. This is something you guys have seen before.

1347
02:09:38.500 --> 02:09:49.649
Anthony Taylor: It's totally understandable. If you don't remember all of these values. Okay, but it's it's something that go back and look at those

1348
02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:56.229
Anthony Taylor: other ones. Don't try to learn it. Here, go back and look at the other. Then we ended

1349
02:09:56.470 --> 02:09:59.990
Anthony Taylor: from our flat layer. We did one hidden layer.

1350
02:10:02.130 --> 02:10:12.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then that built beginning of our model, our Cnn. Now we're saying, give me a new hidden layer and an output branch number one

1351
02:10:14.250 --> 02:10:20.490
Anthony Taylor: and connect it to to here. So this this hidden layer

1352
02:10:20.530 --> 02:10:25.160
Anthony Taylor: does not affect any of these other branches.

1353
02:10:26.340 --> 02:10:35.350
Anthony Taylor: Same with this hidden layer and this one and this one they all are, are unique to this branch. Now let me ask you a question.

1354
02:10:36.810 --> 02:10:46.790
Anthony Taylor: This is still great. Well, we could already see the scores. Okay. So we got like a charitable score on expression, accuracy

1355
02:10:48.340 --> 02:10:55.510
Anthony Taylor: terrible, and not a very good score on Pose X. What might be an option

1356
02:10:58.130 --> 02:11:02.149
Anthony Taylor: that we could try before, like just saying, Forget it. We can't do expressions.

1357
02:11:06.090 --> 02:11:07.829
Anthony Taylor: and it would be in this cell.

1358
02:11:11.210 --> 02:11:12.190
Anthony Taylor: Anybody

1359
02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:21.830
Anthony Taylor: when we did neural networks before. What? What did we have to do to to improve our accuracy?

1360
02:11:25.350 --> 02:11:26.330
michael mcpherson: Add data?

1361
02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:38.050
Anthony Taylor: Well, adding data work. We did that with augment. So we've kind of done more epics, more epics would work now, epics would affect everything.

1362
02:11:38.170 --> 02:11:44.190
Baro, Sonja: More layers was the other layers, so we could come in here

1363
02:11:44.300 --> 02:11:47.790
Anthony Taylor: and add another layer. Maybe add more notes

1364
02:11:48.350 --> 02:11:55.160
Anthony Taylor: right? We could try a number of things because each of these branches can be whatever we need it to be.

1365
02:11:56.480 --> 02:11:59.789
Anthony Taylor: The only thing we're sharing is this first portion.

1366
02:12:01.930 --> 02:12:08.840
Anthony Taylor: right? So it gets to here, then shared everything after that is unique to that branch.

1367
02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:16.120
Anthony Taylor: So you could say, Go to dense shared, and then create another branch that goes to posed dense.

1368
02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:20.989
Anthony Taylor: understand. or expression dense.

1369
02:12:22.590 --> 02:12:28.849
Anthony Taylor: and you could make more, you know, whatever you thought you needed, maybe one would be enough. Maybe 10 would be enough. I have no idea

1370
02:12:29.080 --> 02:12:30.290
Anthony Taylor: that's the point.

1371
02:12:31.300 --> 02:12:34.020
Anthony Taylor: And that's the science of data, science.

1372
02:12:36.060 --> 02:12:37.600
Baro, Sonja: alright

1373
02:12:39.130 --> 02:12:48.869
Anthony Taylor: or the art. I mean, it's there's so much to it. Yeah, I guess it's the art, because there's really no science to it other than the accuracy. Go up. Yeah.

1374
02:12:49.110 --> 02:12:52.750
Baro, Sonja:  yeah.

1375
02:12:52.940 --> 02:12:58.749
Anthony Taylor: But yeah, so I mean, that's really it. Guys, I mean the the

1376
02:12:59.110 --> 02:13:07.729
Anthony Taylor: the hardest part of this particular exercise is knowing what to put in to these convolutional layers. But, like I said, we did cover this the other day.

1377
02:13:07.900 --> 02:13:12.630
Anthony Taylor: You know. Please go back and look through what all this stuff means.

1378
02:13:12.870 --> 02:13:17.860
Anthony Taylor: so that you have this. If you feel you, you really want to get that down.

1379
02:13:18.330 --> 02:13:28.209
Anthony Taylor:  if you're really interested in image machine learning this, this is what you definitely want to get this down.

1380
02:13:29.690 --> 02:13:31.610
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this is

1381
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:33.799
Anthony Taylor: the big one for image right now.

1382
02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:40.569
Anthony Taylor: I'm not saying there's not new stuff coming and up and coming. There's still more stuff out there. But

1383
02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:42.510
Anthony Taylor: understanding this is key.

1384
02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:51.939
Anthony Taylor: Okay? the branching thing. This is really cool, but this II would say, this works for any neural net.

1385
02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:57.760
Anthony Taylor: not justice. any neural network that has multi-classification.

1386
02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:00.470
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

1387
02:14:01.800 --> 02:14:07.129
Anthony Taylor: that's all I have. So, guys. I know you want to go. I have 2 min.

1388
02:14:10.730 --> 02:14:18.669
Anthony Taylor: We're done with neural networks. We're done pretty much now we are gonna talk more machine learning in an Lp.

1389
02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:25.790
Anthony Taylor: and we are going to get into the Llms and transformers. And all of this kind of stuff over the coming couple of weeks.

1390
02:14:26.150 --> 02:14:29.050
Anthony Taylor: But I mean.

1391
02:14:29.480 --> 02:14:33.050
Anthony Taylor: guys, you've learned more machine learning than I've ever taught anybody.

1392
02:14:33.770 --> 02:14:38.740
Clayton Graves: Just remember, guys, transformers are more than meets the eye

1393
02:14:40.170 --> 02:14:42.019
Anthony Taylor: more than meets the eye.

1394
02:14:43.590 --> 02:14:46.739
Anthony Taylor: Now we're all gonna be doing that every time I see transform

1395
02:14:47.820 --> 02:14:51.720
Anthony Taylor: every time. Thank you, Clayton, for sticking that in my brain

1396
02:14:51.750 --> 02:14:53.400
Clayton Graves: what I'm here for. Thanks.

1397
02:14:55.450 --> 02:15:01.450
Anthony Taylor: anyway. So be excited, guys, you have a ton of information.

1398
02:15:03.470 --> 02:15:07.870
Anthony Taylor: that's all I have. So what is today? Monday?

1399
02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:16.639
Anthony Taylor: Have a great Tuesday, and I will see you Wednesday. And we're gonna start learning how to make computers

1400
02:15:16.770 --> 02:15:20.570
Anthony Taylor: more importantly. make computers comprehend

1401
02:15:22.300 --> 02:15:28.930
Anthony Taylor: something they don't know how to do. And I can tell you. here's my favorite example.

1402
02:15:30.270 --> 02:15:31.690
Anthony Taylor: Let's eat, grandma.

1403
02:15:33.610 --> 02:15:35.729
Anthony Taylor: Let's eat comma, grandma.

1404
02:15:37.030 --> 02:15:48.960
Anthony Taylor: Comma save lives. Computers don't understand them. Okay. so we're gonna teach it. So it understands them.

1405
02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:54.449
Clayton Graves: I know what my court defense is. Gonna be, thanks.

1406
02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:02.949
Anthony Taylor: That's actually a T-shirt. I think that one something like that.

1407
02:16:03.700 --> 02:16:07.329
Anthony Taylor: But anyway, alright, King, have a great Tuesday.

1408
02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:09.849
Anthony Taylor: See? Ya, we'll be here 30 min.

1409
02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:11.100
Raugewitz, Tania: I don't.
