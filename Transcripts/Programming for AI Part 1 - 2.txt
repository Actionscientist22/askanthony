00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:48.390
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I got kicked out of truck driving school. I was almost done. It was terrible, I know. Go ahead. Ask how do you get kicked out of truck drivers. Michael, you're going to love this.

9
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:55.460
Anthony Taylor: they said. Dress professionally. I wore a fish tie. They said that wasn't professional, and I told them to

18
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.900
Anthony Taylor: But anyway, I guess I shouldn't say that on the recording if you're watching. I didn't mean it.

19
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.790
Anthony Taylor: Just kidding. Okay? All right, let's continue. Well, good news is, someone did closed captioning.

20
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.720
Anthony Taylor: So at least it'll be

21
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.610
Anthony Taylor: translated. Okay, so here we go.

22
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.030
Anthony Taylor: Let's get to work. We haven't excite Kevin. Were you able to push the activities I gave you.

23
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.180
Kevin Nguyen: II just saw it right now. Anthony, so is it just for the second one today. Only right?

24
00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:08.439
Anthony Taylor: It's so far. I converted everything to notebooks they needed right now. Just push them all solutions and everything. They'll try to split it up alright as soon as he says you're gonna do a pool, so I will lecture.

25
00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:12.580
Anthony Taylor: and then we will do a pull. Okay? And then we will start.

26
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:24.530
Anthony Taylor:  Sorry I had the slides open. I closed them. I did not put the slides in yet.

27
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:38.790
Anthony Taylor: So programming day 2. Here we are. We are all officially programmers. because we programmed on day one. Now, we're just going to get that.

28
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.179
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now, the way we do this way, this works

29
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.750
Anthony Taylor: is every lecture going to introduce a new topic.

30
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.490
Anthony Taylor: Then you're gonna do something duplicate what I just introduced to you.

31
00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:02.930
Anthony Taylor: then a new topic. By the end of the day you should learn more than yeah. 7, 8, 9, busy day. 10 talks. But most of these topics are relatively simple.

32
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.030
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, so

33
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.449
Anthony Taylor: don't let them mess with your head. Just wait. Go ahead and pull.

34
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:18.070
Anthony Taylor: Oh, okay. So everybody you want me to just pause like 60 s, and everybody go do a quick get, pull on, get lab.

35
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:26.310
Anthony Taylor: is everybody using gitlab and doing git pools or people downloaded anybody downloading? Can you show them, Anthony, please?

36
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.699
Anthony Taylor: I can't, because mine's broken. You can show that

37
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.349
Anthony Taylor: he's going to share eventually.

38
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.750
Kevin Nguyen: Can't. I can't pull because I pushed

39
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.160
Anthony Taylor: you talking about cause mine's updated. It'll be empty.

40
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.119
Anthony Taylor:  James, did you already pull

41
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:15.829
James Torres: my, my get labs broken, too. Maybe we clone it whose is working and wants to show us.

42
00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:22.449
Masarirambi, Rodney: Well, I haven't down I've been. I've been downloading. I haven't pulled, so would that work or

43
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:30.849
Anthony Taylor: no? I've just been downloading. I haven't pulled anything. So Kevin share it in in slack.

44
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.859
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, go ahead, Sonia.

45
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:44.090
sonja baro: I was, gonna ask him. So you can do it in terminal or in vs, the question I have in vs, because I've been trying to push and save my work

46
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:52.320
sonja baro: from the activities, and it won't let me, obviously, because I can't push. But I can see that there's a there is something for me to download.

47
00:04:52.870 --> 00:05:12.310
sonja baro: Can I just do that or or pull, I should say.

48
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:19.339
Clayton Graves: for whatever reason it's failing on me now. So I just did it through terminal through. Get bash terminal

49
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:27.599
Anthony Taylor: good. If anyone is. If anyone is not doing, get pulls. You need to make some time with the with us, after or before class

50
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:40.980
Mason, Natalie: are you talking about pulling? Are you talking about pulling from the clone that we are supposed to download the git lab? Member? Get lab that where? I said, that's your textbook. Every day before class, you should do a git clone. Right?

51
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.890
Mason, Natalie: Okay? So

52
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:56.849
Mason, Natalie: I have. Okay. Well, I have. II started down with or cloning what we were to clone. And it's been going on for like a couple of hours.

53
00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.970
Mason, Natalie: Okay, cancel it. It's spat. It's broken. Just do it again.

54
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.429
Mason, Natalie: That's okay. It should only take like 2 s. So don't worry.

55
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:06.870
Mason, Natalie: Alright, yeah.

56
00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.359
Anthony Taylor: Alright, Sonya, did you share? Yeah, I'm sharing. And so did you?

57
00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:21.509
Anthony Taylor: Yeah. What I'm showing you is at the bottom. See this one? Don't mess with that one. Don't mess with that one. Go to let me get the arrow. 1 s.

58
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.810
Anthony Taylor: Go right here.

59
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And

60
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.480
sonja baro: this was all stuff. Click, yeah, don't worry about it. Click right there.

61
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:39.510
Anthony Taylor: So you're gonna abandon those let's not even abandon them. Let's do click! Click! That number 4 again.

62
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.329
Anthony Taylor: Where is it? Is it? Click, the dropdown arrow

63
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.039
Anthony Taylor: right here, where? See? My arrow is pointing at it.

64
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.360
Anthony Taylor: Nope, don't do that.

65
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.439
Anthony Taylor: Click, this one. Get there. Eventually

66
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.569
Anthony Taylor: one of them has a whole menu. There it is. Just do a

67
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:11.829
Anthony Taylor: okay, wait, please clean. Alright. Yeah, it's last week II would say, this is the one time where I don't want you to use VR word Vs code is a bit of a headache.

68
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:18.590
Anthony Taylor: Just go to like, get bash, just go to the folder right click open and get bash or open and terminal. And

69
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:26.459
Anthony Taylor: well, I'm getting the error in in this, too. Well, let's see. So are you in the right folder?

70
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:34.049
sonja baro: Yeah, let me show you I had the same thing where a get pull gave a not a git repository error.

71
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.439
Dipinto, Matt: but a get clone worked fine.

72
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:45.490
Dipinto, Matt: So do you have. That means you over. Wrote it. Well, you always have to do a phone first. Yeah, okay, so I think that might be a problem

73
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.750
Dipinto, Matt: never cloned off here because

74
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:53.839
Clayton Graves: once you do a clone. You actually in terminal, you can see into the clone

75
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.900
Clayton Graves: and then do a get pull from there.

76
00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.889
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, no, everybody's been doing it, Matt.

77
00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:14.600
Anthony Taylor: Only a couple of

78
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:16.450
sonja baro: dash.

79
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:18.930
Anthony Taylor: Get space

80
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:26.650
Anthony Taylor: stash. No dash. Yeah. There you go. Enter. Okay. Now get boom.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:32.010
Anthony Taylor: hey? Go! You're done. Hey?

82
00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:35.069
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, here's what just happened.

83
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.680
Anthony Taylor: Did Stash hides the work that you wrote?

84
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.010
Anthony Taylor: You can bring it back.

85
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.539
Anthony Taylor: That's okay. Okay. But

86
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:50.389
Anthony Taylor: that was cool alright. So I haven't used any of the gitlab files. So, Kevin, you put them in slack right?

87
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:59.310
Dipinto, Matt: Oh, sorry! That was that, was response to Mike. I'm I'm but Kevin, you put the zip file in slack.

88
00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:01.069
Kevin Nguyen: No, I'll put it on right now.

89
00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:09.149
Anthony Taylor: Okay, good. So those of you that do not know how to get that pool yet, which is okay. I just want you to see Kevin or James

90
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.350
Anthony Taylor: after class.

91
00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:17.380
Anthony Taylor: Okay, no. Just download the zip file. He's gonna put in slack for you right now.

92
00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.769
Anthony Taylor: It's everything, and it's the instructor solution. So don't look at them.

93
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:27.749
Anthony Taylor: Don't! Don't make me sad that I showed you the instructor solutions.

94
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.570
Anthony Taylor: but I'm going to explain why you're getting them differently than normal this time. Okay.

95
00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:39.429
Anthony Taylor: first class objectives. I'm adding a class objective. First class objective of day.

96
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:45.369
Anthony Taylor: Well, we'll be tied with first lesson. We're gonna learn how to use notebooks.

97
00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:52.660
Anthony Taylor: Notebooks are a much easier way to learn python and

98
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:58.629
Anthony Taylor: most data engineers, data scientists that work in python work in notebooks

99
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:00.760
Anthony Taylor: there are some that don't.

100
00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.159
There's nothing wrong with them.

101
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:09.159
Anthony Taylor: Okay, there are also people that prefer to ride bikes up hills instead of cars.

102
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay. totally get it.

103
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.829
Anthony Taylor: It's up to you alright, except at least the bike thing. You get some health benefit out

104
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:26.309
Anthony Taylor: alright. So we're going to learn notebooks today. So that's extra. We usually don't learn that til Panda's week, which is 2 weeks away.

105
00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.130
Anthony Taylor: It's just trust me. You're gonna be happy.

106
00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:34.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're gonna learn how to make lists to post.

107
00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:36.450
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna learn how to manipulate them.

108
00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:47.470
Anthony Taylor: We're going to formulate, if and else statements. If you've ever done any kind of development you've done, if and else statements. Okay, we're going to integrate Ellip.

109
00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:56.940
Anthony Taylor: No, it's not an elephant. We're going to look at type. We're gonna make some loops. Remember those 4 fundamentals I told you about

110
00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:08.349
Anthony Taylor: variables, functions, conditionals, if else. And loops. Okay, all 4 fundamentals. You will be done with the 4 fundamentals today.

111
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:13.430
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. let us begin. So

112
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:15.250
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to go to VS. Code.

113
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:20.500
Anthony Taylor: go to today's activities. So in the activities today

114
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:24.459
Anthony Taylor: that you just got don't have this

115
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.679
Anthony Taylor: we need to make sure you have the right ones.

116
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:29.810
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

117
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:33.540
Anthony Taylor: you should see a.py file

118
00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:38.040
Anthony Taylor: and a dot IPYN, B.

119
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.309
sonja baro: Does everybody see that? Let's start there? Well, slow down for a second.

120
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:47.129
Anthony Taylor: I am not moving. I'm frozen like like froze like a prop. Sick.

121
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.829
Anthony Taylor: Hold on! I'm gonna drink some tea.

122
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.090
Anthony Taylor: I'm saying that out loud, hey? I make good tea.

123
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.489
sonja baro: I did say that out loud.

124
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.219
Anthony Taylor: What did you say?

125
00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:11.679
Anthony Taylor: I said. I'll slow down unless I love it. When you guys say, slow down. I don't mind that. I don't mind that. I mean, there are times when I can't.

126
00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:14.990
Anthony Taylor: But but right now I can. It's early. We're okay.

127
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.870
Anthony Taylor: Alright, are we? Good?

128
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:35.499
sonja baro: II like to hear you guys laugh and tell me when you need me to slow down. Honest to God, tell me that are gonna hurt my feelings. So what we're looking for under the solved. What was the names of the extensions you gave us?

129
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.529
Anthony Taylor: IEYE y. Got it

130
00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:47.459
Anthony Taylor: so click on that one in Vs code. Just one click will do it. And you should see what I have on screen.

131
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:57.960
Anthony Taylor: Yes, okay, it should be little commands. It's probably. And up here in the corner. It says, Select kernel. go ahead and click that.

132
00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:02.210
Anthony Taylor: And if it doesn't come up, click python kernels

133
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.630
Anthony Taylor: and then select your anaconda base kernel.

134
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:11.180
Anthony Taylor: Okay, tell me if anybody's stuck, I'm I'm okay. Time. Yeah, I'm being still.

135
00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:15.750
Kevin Nguyen: And it's worth it to let us know if you're stuck right now, and you can't get here.

136
00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:21.230
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, don't do not go. Oh, I'll talk to him later. No.

137
00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:26.260
Raugewitz, Tania: okay, right here. I don't have the. Where do I get kernels from?

138
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.250
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to help share your screen.

139
00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:30.300
Raugewitz, Tania: Yes, sir.

140
00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.560
Anthony Taylor: I am your father.

141
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:39.279
Anthony Taylor: that post and movie back there. I was there. I was there.

142
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.379
Anthony Taylor: The first movie I actually remember seeing in a movie theater

143
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.820
Raugewitz, Tania: is Star Wars. Me, too.

144
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:46.649
Anthony Taylor: They're crazy.

145
00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:51.240
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So yeah, you actually, you don't have the I. So you don't have the right.

146
00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:52.950
Anthony Taylor: Did you do a git? Pull?

147
00:13:54.200 --> 00:14:00.129
Raugewitz, Tania: Well, no, that's one of my questions. And so I

148
00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:06.980
Raugewitz, Tania: I'm I think, getting a little discombobulated here.

149
00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:11.660
Anthony Taylor: it's okay. That's what I'm here for, slack.

Raugewitz, Tania: delete it.

164
00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:19.480
Anthony Taylor: Delete it.

165
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.460
Raugewitz, Tania: You sure?

166
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.570
Anthony Taylor: Yes, deleted.

167
00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.319

Raugewitz, Tania: Thank you.

172
00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.030
Anthony Taylor: Did you get it?

173
00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:48.559
Raugewitz, Tania: But not yet.

174
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:53.930
Anthony Taylor: Scissors? Okay, now do this back arrow like 2 times or one time

175
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.880
Anthony Taylor: perfect. One time what just happened there.

176

Anthony Taylor: Okay, don't worry about it. Press. Okay. And now, right click in this white area

177

178
00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.959
Anthony Taylor: Now right click that folder

179
00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.319
Anthony Taylor: and extract all.

180
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:19.859
Raugewitz, Tania: And then just say, Okay, whatever it says, it's fine. Yeah.

181
00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:21.290
Anthony Taylor: Extract. Yep.

182
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.879
Anthony Taylor: Oh, my God, we are done.

183
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.860
Anthony Taylor: Now come back over here

184
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:37.360
Anthony Taylor: clicked on the down arrow for number 2, click on activities. Click on the first one solved.

185
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:46.749
Anthony Taylor: Wow. okay, for those of you that are joining us right here. It's detecting kernels. This is what I was talking about right here.

186
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:50.990
Anthony Taylor: The good news is you'll never have to do any of that mess again.

187
00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.540
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna learn how to do, get arrows and

188
00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:55.880
Anthony Taylor: what, Mike.

189
00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:00.029
Anthony Taylor: I'm not there, either. I can't get the.

190
00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:05.319
Anthony Taylor: We're gonna make it happen just hanging hold on waiting for her thing to detect kernels.

191
00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.650
Raugewitz, Tania: Least, I'm not the only one.

192
00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:14.500
Anthony Taylor: It wouldn't even matter if you would only want everyone learns at their own pace.

193
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:20.019
Anthony Taylor: My job is before this is over. Make you all learn at the same pace.

194
00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:26.700
Anthony Taylor: That's not true. He's got to learn one way or another.

195
00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:28.740
Raugewitz, Tania: I know it's possible

196
00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:32.530
Anthony Taylor: it's coming. Oh, it's absolutely possible. I've got

197
00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:38.990
Anthony Taylor: couple of 100 students now that will tell you. It's awful in the beginning. Just deal with it. You'll be fine.

198
00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:47.670
Raugewitz, Tania: Well, this is relevant. So sometimes I sub for preschool and kindergarten classes as a classroom made.

199
00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:57.519
Raugewitz, Tania: and that's not my preferred age group. But what these teachers can do with preschoolers 4 and 5 year olds, and at the end of the year

200
00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.370
Raugewitz, Tania: that they're all kind of on the similar similar page.

201
00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.519
Raugewitz, Tania: I feel like there's hope for me, cause

202
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:08.219
Raugewitz, Tania: if those preschoolers can learn stuff I can't do.

203
00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:12.629
Anthony Taylor: Come over here and click, view. Something's wrong. This should not take this long.

204
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:22.169
Clayton Graves: You should keep in mind that you paid for this. You deserve all the time you need to understand it.

205
00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:26.399
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so I'm going to correct you on one thing. Click.

206
00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:31.859
Anthony Taylor: you deserve all of the time. That doesn't take time from all of the other people that paid for it.

207
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.189
Raugewitz, Tania: Yes, as long as you put in the work.

208
00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:44.310
Anthony Taylor: If you come in and you're not prepared, then I will put you in a room with a tail right?

209
00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:45.810
Anthony Taylor: Click that command palette.

210
00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:59.009
Anthony Taylor: I just wanted to. I just wanted to say that because you're right, I am. And I am like super aware of what you guys pay for this class. So I try to give you way more than most. But at the same time.

211
00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:04.759
Anthony Taylor: you know, if somebody comes in and they're not prepared. And and they're like dragging the whole class down.

212
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:10.799
Raugewitz, Tania: That's a different story. Okay? Type. Python. Right? There. Yeah. But that's not how we are.

213
00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:14.339
Raugewitz, Tania: We're all very no, you are not. Guys are freaking amazing.

214
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.409
Anthony Taylor: I just wanted to. I wanted to catch that early

215

Anthony Taylor: alright scroll down. We're looking for actually change that to Colonel.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.330
Raugewitz, Tania: How do I spell it?

217
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:30.310
Anthony Taylor: That's it. You did it perfect! But

218
00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:32.270
Anthony Taylor: you don't have one.

219
00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.090

221
00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.650
Anthony Taylor: type python up there.

222
00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:53.400
Anthony Taylor: It's installed.

223
00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.000
Anthony Taylor: How is that even happening.

224
00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:03.819
Anthony Taylor:  I have no idea what's going on. Click on this

225
00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.140

Anthony Taylor: Reload.

227
00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:19.970

232
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:51.180
Anthony Taylor: And do python environments and anaconda.

233
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:53.910
Anthony Taylor: There you go. You're good to go

234

236
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:14.619
Anthony Taylor: I really, I'm both famous for doing this on the good side and on the bad side.

260
00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:49.409
Anthony Taylor: Oh, is it alright select kernel.

261
00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.920
Anthony Taylor: python environments.

262
00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.920
Anthony Taylor: And, Conda.

263
00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:00.540
Anthony Taylor: you could use the Dev one, guys. It don't make any difference.

264
00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:06.269
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Hey, Anthony, for the selecting panels.

265
00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.959
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Do you have to do that every time you

266
00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:12.929
Meredith McCanse (she/her): open just like a one time, every time you open a notebook

267
00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:16.919
Anthony Taylor: you can set a default, but I find it doesn't stick very well.

268
00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:21.620
Anthony Taylor:  but yeah, you will need to do it at least once per day.

269
00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:34.220
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I when I went to it, might. It was already showing base python for me. I didn't have to select anything because you rock Meredith. I don't. I think it's an accident, but

270
00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:44.640
Anthony Taylor: just good luck.

271
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:51.600
Anthony Taylor: But the good news is, if you try to run something and it's not selected, it'll say, Hey, you need select kernel. So it's pretty obvious.

272
00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:55.439
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Anybody else, Christine, can we help you

273
00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:59.090
michael mcpherson: alright, stop and share. Thank you.

274
00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:10.179
Anthony Taylor: Show us, remember, guys actually like a 20 min lecture that we are saving time.

275
00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:16.719
Anthony Taylor: because in like 3 weeks, when you're supposed to learn this, we would have had to do this then. Now we're doing it. Now

276
00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.740
Kanouff, Christine: share your screen, Christine.

277
00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:24.599
Kanouff, Christine:  hold on here, let me.

278
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.330
Anthony Taylor: And that's good food.

279
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.929
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So the only

280
00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:38.530
Kanouff, Christine: the question that I have is.

281
00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:47.150
Kanouff, Christine: is there an issue? If I'm only opening these one file at a time from here. It's gonna make you crazy.

282
00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:55.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay, always do open folder. But go back here on the pierc. Yeah, click, that

283
00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:00.189
Anthony Taylor: click, click. This is it already there.

284
00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:02.870
Anthony Taylor: So weird. What screen was that? Click it again?

285
00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:10.679
Anthony Taylor: Oh, because you don't have a full. Yeah, always open full. So open the activities for today.

286
00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.400
Kanouff, Christine: Let's see.

287
00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:15.209
Anthony Taylor: So like, go back.

288
00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:16.630
Kanouff, Christine: Yeah.

289
00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:19.119
Anthony Taylor: I wanna let you go back here.

290
00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:24.710
Anthony Taylor: Click there, there you go! Go back to.

291
00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.760
Anthony Taylor: I gotta remember where I put it now.

292
00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:32.170
Anthony Taylor: Well, probably in here. Did you clone, or did you just copy it?

293
00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:35.419
Kanouff, Christine: No, I there we go.

294
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.230
Kanouff, Christine: So it's not. Yeah. I'll do 2

295
00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:41.790
Anthony Taylor: double click

296
00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:49.139
Anthony Taylor: activities, single click. And now open okay, so that will drop them all in.

297
00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:54.089
Anthony Taylor: And now, do you wanna save changes? You made? No, just say, don't save

298
00:25:55.820 --> 00:26:03.340
Anthony Taylor: great. Now go to O one. So now, when I say, All right, we're doing online, are we doing awesome? Now you know what I'm talking about. So

299
00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:06.940
Anthony Taylor: let's make sure you're there. Good! You have it. Let's check your kernels.

300
00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:14.049
Anthony Taylor: I already think you don't have to select anybody else. I saw Natalie might have had. Nope.

301
00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:15.089
Mason, Natalie: Oh, yeah.

302
00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:21.149
Anthony Taylor: alright, alright. It's all good. It's what we're here for is to learn.

303
00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:25.279
Anthony Taylor: and we're gonna make Clayton watch every single one

304
00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:34.319
Anthony Taylor: I like. He's my kind of dude. He's got the same color beard. I have no complaints.

305
00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:38.199
Anthony Taylor: I love that, Clinton. Thank you for not having

306
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:48.679
Anthony Taylor: wait. I think you even have the same set of oh, it's a wizard. Okay, what? The Holy Mo. Okay, you can't open a zip file. You're trying to open a zip file.

307
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.939
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So here's what I want you to do. I want you to right click this.

308
00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.350
Anthony Taylor: not the x, the file.

309
00:26:55.970 --> 00:27:00.960
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's okay. I right, click, go go back to where you put that file

310
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:04.010
Anthony Taylor: this wherever that is, you don't have to. Right. Click, just go.

311
00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:08.049
Mason, Natalie: No, don't open fire. Oh.

312
00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:16.300
Anthony Taylor: okay, no, that's all right. We can do this here. We can do this here. So see how these all have a little zipper on them. Okay, we gotta lower that zipper.

313
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.890
Anthony Taylor: So right-clicking.

314
00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.509
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And

315
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:27.880
Anthony Taylor: why did it do that? Right? Click the file. I click on the file. And then right click, there you go right, click it.

316
00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.409
Anthony Taylor: and then do extract all.

317
00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:37.389
Mason, Natalie: So it does look like Miss Natalie needs some. Get lab time, gentlemen.

318
00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:40.079
Anthony Taylor: okay? And say, extract.

319
00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:52.159
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now click on this folder.

320
00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.160
Anthony Taylor: See? It does not have a zipper.

321
00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.150
Mason, Natalie: Well.

322
00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:58.570
Anthony Taylor: and then press open.

323
00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.230
Anthony Taylor: What? What did you do?

324
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.060
Mason, Natalie: What did I have to.

325
00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:14.549
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I don't.

326
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:16.100
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

327
00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:21.140
Anthony Taylor: Oh, alright! Wait! Why are we still in here? It should have already

328
00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.990
Anthony Taylor: just click open again. No, don't click anything else. Just click open

329
00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:31.379
Dipinto, Matt: open file, not open folder. So it's gonna just keep narrowing down until no look. She's still in a zip.

330
00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:33.700
Anthony Taylor: No, this is it's not

331
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.060
Anthony Taylor: it. It it. I believe, click right here.

332
00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:42.100
activities. Why do you have 2 activities?

333
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:49.469
Anthony Taylor: Okay, stop for 1 s. Hold on. I'm gonna I'm gonna take over. Is that okay.

334
00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:54.469
Anthony Taylor: I'm going to just take over because there's like something weird going on.

335
00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:59.679
Anthony Taylor: And I don't. I don't. I don't fix it. It's gonna make me nuts.

336
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:02.700
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so let me mouse

337
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:14.560
Anthony Taylor: so there's that one. There's that one. There's that one. So we're in activities we're supposed to be collect. Oh, open file, not open folder. Somebody said that too.

338
00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:17.300
Open folder.

339
00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:20.089
Anthony Taylor: Is this the right one?

340
00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:24.560
Anthony Taylor: This is the right one.

341
00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:38.630
Mason, Natalie: What's current? Why do they call it a kernel?

342
00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:43.399
Anthony Taylor: Because it used to make fried chicken.

343
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:47.030
Mason, Natalie: Colonel KER.

344
00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:52.619
Anthony Taylor: It actually is kind of a throwback to like like old school

345
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.560
Anthony Taylor: green screens and stuff.

346
00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:59.569
Anthony Taylor: It's It's just a term used for

347
00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:06.750
Anthony Taylor: like a computer engine or a compute. Okay, it's not a CPU, but it's

348
00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:12.620
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. Do you have a better way to explain it, Clayton. And don't you guys use kernels all the time in your job?

349
00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:20.559
Anthony Taylor: Call out the core. It's it's the core of whatever it is you're working on the core of your operating system.

350
00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:29.360
Anthony Taylor: I like, I like, see, okay, alright. Anybody else stuck. We're gonna get everybody working.

351
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:36.690
Mason, Natalie: are we done you are, you are ready to be solo.

352
00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:40.480
Anthony Taylor: Wow! Anybody else?

353
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:43.679
Anthony Taylor: Nay, then, let us in.

354
00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:49.420
Anthony Taylor: All right, guys. That was an exciting thing. I know. It took a little longer than maybe you like. But here's the thing

355
00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:54.409
Anthony Taylor: before. To show you, python, I had to highlight this

356
00:30:54.500 --> 00:31:00.679
Anthony Taylor: select run, and it showed up in the terminal down below, right? And it was messy and hard to read.

357
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:07.920
Anthony Taylor: Now, when I click this arrow right here, it runs it and shows it right there.

358
00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:11.780
Anthony Taylor: Okay, not only that.

359
00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:21.559
Anthony Taylor: If I want to see all of the variables in my python after I run it, I can click this variables button, and it shows me what current variables are in use.

360
00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.080
Anthony Taylor: Also very, very cool.

361
00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:30.490
Anthony Taylor: I can see an outline of my code. Technically, you can debug it. We don't do a lot of that.

362
00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:32.530
Anthony Taylor: I will say this.

363
00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:38.100
Anthony Taylor: In your in your notebook hit shift, not shift, lookup error.

364
00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:40.220
Anthony Taylor:  Why that?

365
00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.890
Anthony Taylor: Oh, we might add line numbers at some point.

366
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:51.490
Anthony Taylor: But other than that, don't worry. The other cool thing is, if you do need a.py. File hint, hint, you will need one for your challenge.

367
00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:55.989
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you can do the work in this notebook

368
00:31:56.930 --> 00:32:02.710
Anthony Taylor: and then export to a python file.

369
00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:05.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

370
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:16.319
Anthony Taylor: now, the cool thing is most like big products like that one I show I was showing before class today. They use notebooks. We just, we don't even write python files anymore.

371
00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:21.850
Anthony Taylor: We just call the Nope and the notebook runs. It does what it needs to do.

372
00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:28.270
Anthony Taylor: Really easy to debug, really easy to do step by step. Okay, this

373
00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:39.150
Anthony Taylor: you will probably be using until you graduate class, and then probably far beyond that. So we're introducing it today. Never gonna leave this

374
00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:42.110
Anthony Taylor: or something like it.

375
00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:48.430
Anthony Taylor: Alright. everybody comfortable with that. Yes, Sonya.

376
00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:59.190
sonja baro: so my question is, so we got a notebook as part of what we synced up with the poll. Right?

377
00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.430
Anthony Taylor: Right? So.

378
00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:09.620
sonja baro: Mike, I was just. Maybe I don't need to worry about this. But in the future, if we need to create a notebook ourselves.

379
00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:15.190
sonja baro: do we do that here in Vs, or and do do I need?

380
00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:23.930
Anthony Taylor: You can do it so like to do it manually. This is how I started doing it today. And actually, this is a cool story. So I started doing this

381
00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:29.469
this, and I won't finish typing it out. But then I type, I can buy. B,

382
00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:37.960
Anthony Taylor: I didn't actually spell that right? Rename that again. Yeah. IPYN, B.

383
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:58.710
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I got a notebook. Then I went here and I did control a control, back my notebook, paste it. Now I have one cell that's lame. So then I know that control shift gas split cell. So then I had to do this for every single thing. I got to about 2 of these before, so I said, there is no way

384
00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:13.779
Anthony Taylor: I am going to do 10 freaking lessons for this. I love my students, but not that much joking. I love you guys more than that. But oh, no, sir, never again, Clayton?

385
00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:22.729
Anthony Taylor: The short answer is, yes, but better answer. I was annoyed. So I wrote a note with

386
00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.719
sonja baro: a converter

387
00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:30.260
Anthony Taylor: that converts that Python code into notebooks.

388
00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:36.580
Anthony Taylor: and that, as you can see, converted activity. It took about half a second.

389
00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:41.420
Anthony Taylor: Write the code. Yeah, maybe 5, 10 min. But here's thing

390
00:34:41.739 --> 00:34:51.140
Anthony Taylor: I have, like 5 other instructors that are doing this same course. I will give them this. and they will use it also before I was manually doing it. That was lame

391
00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:53.969
Anthony Taylor: right this instant.

392
00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:59.729
Anthony Taylor: Pretty cool. That is the beauty python.

393
00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:11.309
Masarirambi, Rodney: They say that all the all developers you, you'll do something long enough until you get tired of doing it, and then you'll automate or find some other way to it.

394
00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:16.290
Anthony Taylor: Which for me was about 2 minutes.

395
00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:19.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay, everything.

396
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:28.370
sonja baro: So you created your notebook just by changing the extension and then going in and then formatting it by.

397
00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:39.530
Anthony Taylor: Well, what this does is this? So you're gonna learn about these libraries soon. But basically, I brought in a library that that creates a notebook structure.

398
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:44.910
Anthony Taylor: because underneath these notebooks looks like

399
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:51.400
Anthony Taylor: if we open this like in notepad or something.

400
00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:55.219
Anthony Taylor: Do I have notepad? I do.

401
00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:03.600
Anthony Taylor: Oh, it's coming! It's just taking a while. Yup.

402
00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:17.060
Anthony Taylor: Maybe it's this is the one you just created. So it's a blank document. It hasn't been saved. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, that was one that I wasn't paying attention. But you still caught it. Good work.

403
00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:26.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So this is what a notebook actually looks like. All right, you're gonna learn that this is called Json Javascript. Object notation. You don't need to remember that right now.

404
00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:31.940
Anthony Taylor: And that's what it looks like. Okay, so what that library

405
00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.470
Anthony Taylor: that I just showed you

406
00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:44.480
Anthony Taylor: is, it's basically going to create that skeleton and fill in the cells based on what information I give it. I told it.

407
00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:48.300
Anthony Taylor: If you look at this

408
00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:52.779
Anthony Taylor: every time they did something new. They did 2 new lines.

409
00:36:54.520 --> 00:37:00.470
Anthony Taylor: okay? And so I said, Alright, every time you see, 2 new lines make a new sell.

410
00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:05.199
Anthony Taylor: And then that is how we ended up with this notice.

411
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:08.580
Anthony Taylor: Technically. that's not right.

412
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:16.110
Anthony Taylor: But it's right more often than not. So I didn't bother like troubleshooting. But so like this one is just a comment.

413
00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:26.500
Anthony Taylor: whatever okay. is that exciting? Did anybody learn from that? Or do you guys just like this guy is such a geek? Which one is it?

414
00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:32.309
Anthony Taylor: Both right? Okay, good. Alright. So running a comment cell will do nothing. It is a comment.

415
00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:35.410
Anthony Taylor: Okay, how do I know? It's a comment.

416
00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:45.329
Anthony Taylor: It starts with a good.

417
00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:51.720
Anthony Taylor: Let's talk about what I did in this first cell. I just ran it didn't say anything about what it is. So a list

418
00:37:52.270 --> 00:38:01.879
Anthony Taylor: in Python is a very, very, very, very important structure. Okay? Or you can even call it a data type.

419
00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:10.689
Anthony Taylor:  but yeah, so you'll hear. It just depends on who you talk to talk to really geeky people. It's a structure.

420
00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:17.539
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if you talk to like normal people like me, Kevin and James, it's list

421
00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:19.150
Anthony Taylor: or a data type.

422
00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:26.110
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Alright. So I tried to give this more credit than we deserve. The cool thing about lit

423
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:34.849
Anthony Taylor: is they can hold many, many items. They don't have to be the same data type. They are typically separated by commas.

424
00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:38.910
Anthony Taylor: And they are wrapped in square brackets.

425
00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:40.680
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

426
00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:48.030
Anthony Taylor: so that's important. So if I wanted to create a list, I just create a list and assign it to a variable yeah click.

427
00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:52.959
Clayton Graves: So looking at your first list here called Info.

428
00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:58.320
Clayton Graves: You've got a name and then a an age I'm assuming.

429
00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:07.110
Clayton Graves: And how do you maintain relationship between Samar 25 and Kiro? 20, because

430
00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:22.470
Anthony Taylor: I don't even know that that is a relationship, right? It doesn't have to be. It could be Kira's age and 20 could be somebody else's age. It could be it could be something else. It could be somebody's name. Maybe we're like, you know, in the TV. And that's somebody's name.

431
00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:29.140
Anthony Taylor: I don't know, only like 3 people. That's all right.

432
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:32.959
Anthony Taylor: Yes, I promise. I promise.

433
00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.799
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But I love that. You thinking ahead. Thank you.

434
00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:47.020
Anthony Taylor:  Okay. So anyway, to print a list. You just do print. It's just a data type. It's no different than string and integer. Anything else. It's just longer

435
00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:52.129
Anthony Taylor:  So to get to a specific item.

436
00:39:52.220 --> 00:40:02.800
Anthony Taylor: But this starts to address with Clayton brought up. One thing I want you to remember in programming all except for one programming language left top of my head.

437
00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:07.760
Anthony Taylor: Most things start at 0. Not at one.

438
00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:16.249
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Guess what language starts at one anybody ever heard of. R. Oh, wait! Did you know that curry?

439
00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.030
Gardner, Curry: I was? Gonna say, Matlab? But

440
00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:22.350
Gardner, Curry: yeah, oh, maybe. Yeah. Well, Matlab, and ours so soon.

441
00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:25.400
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, you're right. I haven't done that. That. So?

442
00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:29.810
Anthony Taylor: Thank you. Now, I have 2 languages off the top of my head that start at one.

443
00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:41.280
Anthony Taylor: Okay, but they start at 0. So if I want the first value. I always have to start 2. So this will print out tomorrow. Now.

444
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:44.440
Anthony Taylor: what do you think? Negative? One might do anybody want? Guess

445
00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.490
Dipinto, Matt: it's the last object in the list.

446
00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:50.979
Matt, you're a freaking genius. I love that. Look at that

447
00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:54.230
Anthony Taylor: boom, Samar. 20.

448
00:40:55.120 --> 00:41:00.669
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So a negative basically starts at the end of the list and starts coming this direction.

449
00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:06.600
Anthony Taylor: Notice, it doesn't start with 0, because there's no such thing as negative 0.

450
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:10.089
Anthony Taylor: All zeroes you ever see.

451
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:11.280
Positive!

452
00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:22.079
Anthony Taylor: Get an error from that is, if your list is empty, right? Otherwise it's always going to return

453
00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:23.310
Clayton Graves: a value.

454
00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:26.209
Anthony Taylor: But oh, I just got this set up.

455
00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:31.220
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, let's see. I would say.

456
00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:34.159
Anthony Taylor: I think, no matter what passed.

457
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:38.830
Anthony Taylor: If you pass in an empty list and then ask it for index. You're gonna get an index out of range.

458
00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:46.830
Anthony Taylor: Yep, index error list index out of ring. So if you ever try to get data out of an empty list, you'll get an index out of it.

459
00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:51.930
Anthony Taylor: But I'm going to teach you how to handle this eventually. Okay, so don't worry about that too often.

460
00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:56.090
Anthony Taylor:  By the way, to fast comment in a notebook.

461
00:41:56.330 --> 00:42:01.909
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you just have your cursor anywhere in the line and hit control, slash

462
00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:04.419
Anthony Taylor: control slash to uncommon.

463
00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:10.620
Anthony Taylor: Okay. alright. So let's rerun that.

464
00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:21.249
Anthony Taylor: Can you say that one more time you hit control I can control slack, like the one next to your right shift key. And your period.

465
00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:30.539
sonja baro:  Control slash, is the inserts the comment for you or the

466
00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.850
Anthony Taylor: yeah. You don't have to highlight it. You just have to be in the line

467
00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:35.930
Anthony Taylor: or on the line.

468
00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:38.280
Masarirambi, Rodney: I'm on slash for for Mac.

469
00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:46.939
Anthony Taylor: Command slash for Max. Most of the time. When I say Control you, Mac, people can just automatically assume it's command.

470
00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:48.430
Anthony Taylor: okay.

471
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:53.750
Anthony Taylor: windows, we're into control. Max. Want to command everybody.

472
00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:59.080
Anthony Taylor: Alright. That's pretty much it. Okay? So

473
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:06.470
Anthony Taylor: alright. So if we wanted to see the index. Now remember what I said. An index was right.

474
00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:16.920
Anthony Taylor: An index is the numeric value of the position. So index 0 is one index negative. One is the last value, regardless of how many left.

475
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:21.389
Anthony Taylor: But let's say, I want that index value for Kira.

476
00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:26.529
Anthony Taylor: and you might say, well, that's pretty obvious right now, right? What is negative? 2.

477
00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:31.500
Anthony Taylor: I could be negative 2. But it's it's always going to give you the positive one.

478
00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:36.859
Anthony Taylor: But you're right and your 2 fits here. But it's also the positive version is what

479
00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:38.820
Meredith McCanse (she/her): 2, 2,

480
00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:43.260
Anthony Taylor: okay, 0, 1, 2. Okay.

481
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:49.670
Anthony Taylor: so we can ask, hey, I'm gonna pass in that list.

482
00:43:49.890 --> 00:44:00.640
Anthony Taylor: And then there is a method that I'm going to attach to that list. and it says, Give me the index of this value and print it out. 2.

483
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:05.279
Anthony Taylor: Now, another fun thing about Vs code is, if I type.

484
00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:08.459
Anthony Taylor: if I start to type, it should automatically fill it in.

485
00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:12.179
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Also, if you hit period.

486
00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:18.830
Anthony Taylor: you can see every method, every property attached to that.

487
00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:26.039
Anthony Taylor: whatever it is. Anything. Okay? And then usually

488
00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:29.140
Anthony Taylor: you hold your mouth. Oh.

489
00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:37.059
Anthony Taylor: there! There is another one whoops to me. So since those all had that little square in front, that means their methods.

490
00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:42.340
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so I can come in here. It's not.

491
00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:44.310
Anthony Taylor: It's not.

492
00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:52.469
Anthony Taylor: I think I might turn that off because it's so, some of you. When you do this, you're gonna get like the whole definition of that method.

493
00:44:53.480 --> 00:45:02.249
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's really cool. It's very good. When you're starting. It's really, really busy for me to teach you with it, because it's like Phil's screen.

494
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:07.200
Anthony Taylor: So sometimes you'll see it sometimes you won't alright. But

495
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:13.740
Anthony Taylor: how would I find it's it's really pretty easy. I'm gonna go, and I'm gonna do search on.

496
00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.130
Anthony Taylor: And then here it is.

497
00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:23.239
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Well, that's a terrible. That's terrible example terrible. This one's a better example.

498
00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:26.130
Anthony Taylor: And then there you go. And this is gonna tell you exactly how to do.

499
00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:27.800
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

500
00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:30.100
Anthony Taylor: alright

501
00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.440
data structures

502
00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:41.609
Anthony Taylor: holds information isn't a variable. In fact, they often store multiple variables. They can open variables, our whole variables. That's true multiple pieces, multiple types.

503
00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:45.219
Anthony Taylor: Okay, indexing and slicing. Alright. So

504
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:53.570
Anthony Taylor: we've learned how to. We've learned how to get next, we've learned how to pull single items out. What if I want a range of items

505
00:45:54.170 --> 00:46:01.940
Anthony Taylor: like I wanted? I want, you know, 2 or 3 items. Well, that we refer to as slicing.

506
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:09.700
Anthony Taylor: We're going to slice it. I want to slice a piece of the list. Okay, so here, info list

507
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:16.360
Anthony Taylor: to slice it just like we did up here with one number, we're going to create.

508
00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:19.360
Anthony Taylor: It's it's technically a list.

509
00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:21.110
Anthony Taylor: Alright with

510
00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:25.610
Anthony Taylor:  the start and the end.

511
00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:27.250
Anthony Taylor: Now, this is interesting.

512
00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:29.940
Anthony Taylor: says 2, 4.

513
00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:34.320
Anthony Taylor: Is there a 4?

514
00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:41.400
Anthony Taylor: Is there 2? We know what 2 is right. We already talked about what 2? 2 is Kira?

515
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:42.870
Anthony Taylor: What would 4 be

516
00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:45.430
michael mcpherson: 20,

517
00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:47.580
Anthony Taylor: 4 would be nothing.

518
00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:51.640
Anthony Taylor: This 20 is 0 1,

519
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:53.660
Anthony Taylor: 2, 3.

520
00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:58.759
Anthony Taylor: Now, here's the interesting thing. I don't know if you did this on purpose. Mike.

521
00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:02.209
Anthony Taylor: the way this slicing works

522
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:08.310
Anthony Taylor: is, it starts at the number you put it. and it stops

523
00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:11.930
Anthony Taylor: 4. It reaches the last number.

524
00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:15.339
Anthony Taylor: which means this will started to.

525
00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:19.620
Anthony Taylor: And and before it hits 4, which is

526
00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:20.760
Anthony Taylor: 3.

527
00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:25.480
Anthony Taylor: So in this particular case, you're gonna get here at one.

528
00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:27.329
Anthony Taylor: See? Like I said, Mike.

529
00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:35.409
Anthony Taylor: okay, we're gonna show here. You know what? And this is. This is why I do know. Books is, I can run that, and we can move on to the next.

530
00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:38.859
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so now, this one is interesting. Right?

531
00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:42.190
Anthony Taylor: Info list one.

532
00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:48.249
Anthony Taylor: And then there's nothing. What do you think that's going to show it's going to start where?

533
00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:52.550
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, I'm gonna bring this down below so we can see it. So we don't have to scroll up and down

534
00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:54.440
here.

535
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:58.979
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so it's where's it? Gonna start?

536
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:04.020
Anthony Taylor: I heard it. 25 is correct. That's 0 1.

537
00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:05.679
Anthony Taylor: Where's it going to end?

538
00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:10.360
Jennifer Dahlgren: DC, Holist.

539
00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:19.189
Anthony Taylor: It's gonna do the whole list. It's gonna do the rest of the list right? So we're basically saying, Start at one and give me the rest. Give it all to

540
00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:20.910
Anthony Taylor: whatever's left.

541
00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:24.950
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. Now, it was an interesting one.

542
00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:30.290
Anthony Taylor: That's kind of weird, right?

543
00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:35.589
Anthony Taylor: So knowing that the 2. So let's talk about these 2 arguments.

544
00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:39.740
Anthony Taylor: it is stark and stop.

545
00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:42.920
Anthony Taylor: Okay, start.

546
00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:44.770
Anthony Taylor: Don't stop.

547
00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.679
Anthony Taylor: What would that mean? This telling us

548
00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:59.069
Anthony Taylor: that's gonna give you 0 and one. So you're gonna only get these first 2 valves. However, it doesn't include 2.

549
00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:07.359
Clayton Graves: You would do number 10. Why would you ever want to do that when you could just tell it to just display the whole list.

550
00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:21.090
Anthony Taylor: Well, say, you just don't want the first one like, for instance, a lot of times you'll have id numbers right? That really don't mean anything like if you're doing a machine learning model, which you guys will be doing in a couple of weeks, right? And you pull in data. And there's an index

551
00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:25.759
Anthony Taylor: like. Say, you know, excel number or something you'd be like. I don't want that.

552
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:33.220
Anthony Taylor: That that number means nothing to me. so I'm going to grab everything after that store it so that I can get the right date.

553
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:40.860
Anthony Taylor: Okay, there's that's absolutely an example that you would see there. Most of the reason we use slicing is if we have large

554
00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:48.139
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Anthony on the one that you just on the one that you on the one you just did. How come it didn't give you back

555
00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:52.589
Meredith McCanse (she/her):  Samar. And then Kira, yeah.

556
00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:56.550
Anthony Taylor: because remember, it stops before the number.

557
00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:02.669
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay, got it. Got it. So it starts at the number

558
00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:05.330
Anthony Taylor: stops before the number.

559
00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:06.450
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Okay?

560
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:11.470
Anthony Taylor: So it's not as we like to say, it's non inclusive. I know that's not. PC,

561
00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:13.350
Anthony Taylor: but that's the way it is.

562
00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:17.390
Anthony Taylor: Questions. So what?

563
00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:21.499
sonja baro: Oh, so I'm just again thinking of the application like

564
00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:32.760
sonja baro: forget who was saying it. It was a Clayton, Clayton was saying it like, why? And you you were saying that it was because you might have stuff you want to ignore in front.

565
00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:34.489
sonja baro: or would that.

566
00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:40.760
Anthony Taylor: or be absolutely? Maybe you just have some junk data. And you want to get rid of certain sections of the data.

567
00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:44.690
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you're gonna honestly like we're we're

568
00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:57.950
Anthony Taylor: and and I'm not trying to discourage questions and love the questions. But what I want to say is, remember, right now, we're working with a list of 4 things when we get work in guys, we're going to be dealing with hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of things.

569
00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:09.080
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then these little things are gonna be like, Oh, thank God, I can do that. Otherwise you'd have to like, figure out how many columns. And it's awful. Okay.

570
00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:17.150
Anthony Taylor: it's gonna get easier, I promise. Okay. So here we hear with the instant append, okay, append, just means add

571
00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:28.129
Anthony Taylor: alright and not mathematically add, we're going to append a value into our cool little list. So when we run this, we now have come out.

572
00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:30.000
Anthony Taylor: Come out

573
00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:32.850
Anthony Taylor: okay.

574
00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:37.369
Anthony Taylor: Alright. We can. Also, if we wanted to

575
00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:40.880
Anthony Taylor: put a value at a specific location.

576
00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:44.149
Anthony Taylor: I do actually.

577
00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:49.459
Anthony Taylor: no, this one's gonna actually overwrite the value at a specific location.

578
00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:59.260
Anthony Taylor: So we're gonna say, for Number 3, I want you to change it to 85. So 0 1, 2, 3, we're gonna change that 20

579
00:51:59.370 --> 00:52:01.000
Anthony Taylor: to the value. 85.

580
00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:04.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

581
00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:07.870
Anthony Taylor: And here here we can remove a value.

582
00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:10.990
Anthony Taylor: Kamal's gone

583
00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:14.790
Anthony Taylor: alright. Now

584
00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:27.940
Anthony Taylor: we learn how to create a list, learn how to pick items out of a list. We learn how to pick ranges out of the list. We learn how to add and remove from the list and update the list. Think of how many things you just learn.

585
00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:33.430
Anthony Taylor: holy cow! You didn't even know what a list was this morning. Well, you did, but not this.

586
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:34.680
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

587
00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:41.080
Anthony Taylor: Now we're going to talk about how to get an item from the list.

588
00:52:41.490 --> 00:52:48.889
Anthony Taylor: Assign it to a variable and remove it from the list. Does that make sense?

589
00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:56.070
Anthony Taylor: Let's find out. So yeah, ex, exactly. So here I'm gonna go

590
00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:08.800
Anthony Taylor: here and I'm going to copy this paste it alright. So I'm gonna do what's called a pop. So what this is going to do, it's going to pop the 0 item, which is Samar.

591
00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:18.490
Anthony Taylor: and it's gonna show it. And then it's going to do this and it's gonna print it. So now, you what didn't show it. So now you can see that one's gone.

592
00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:21.919
Anthony Taylor: So let's do this.

593
00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:27.509
Anthony Taylor: I don't know. Let's just say,

594
00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:28.830
Anthony Taylor: new

595
00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:35.340
Anthony Taylor: equals. Okay. And not only am I gonna print the info list. I'm gonna print new pop

596
00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:40.629
Anthony Taylor: alright. So we're gonna pop again. What's gonna come into this this variable

597
00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:44.640
derek: 25

598
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:48.860
Anthony Taylor: at 25. Exactly. So we see it.

599
00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:53.069
Anthony Taylor: 25 is gone. And now it is at the value of that variable.

600
00:53:54.250 --> 00:53:58.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay, okay? So that means we can now use it for whatever we're doing.

601
00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:01.280
Anthony Taylor: Yes, I'm

602
00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:07.819
sonja baro: can you? Can you just go through that little sequence? One more time I will do it. Watch this, I'll do the same one.

603
00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:10.720
Anthony Taylor: What is. Now you see the list.

604
00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:14.829
Anthony Taylor: we're gonna pop out the 0 item, which is the first one

605
00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:16.919
Anthony Taylor: and put it into.

606
00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:20.439
sonja baro: When you say Pop out, it's removing it from the list.

607
00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:26.100
Anthony Taylor: Well, it's just taking that value and assigning it to whenever I tell it, to assign it.

608
00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:33.120
Anthony Taylor: and up here we didn't assign it to anything we just got rid of. Okay, here, I said, put it in this variable.

609
00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:46.709
Clayton Graves: So I'm just this. I'm sorry I'm just stuck on. Think of it as you're pulling it out of a bowl. You're popping it out of the bowl, and

610
00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:50.390
Clayton Graves: I mean the variable is another container.

611
00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:54.369
Clayton Graves: So you just got one putting it in another.

612
00:54:55.090 --> 00:55:00.829
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so here, let's let's recreate the list. Alright. So now we're back to this whole list.

613
00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:09.430
Anthony Taylor: So I'm gonna go back down to the new pop. So I'm gonna grab the first item I'm going to put it in this variable. Assign it to this variable.

614
00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:13.970
Anthony Taylor: So that means, if I need that item to use it for something else, it's in this variable.

615
00:55:14.350 --> 00:55:17.840
Anthony Taylor: However, it is no longer in my list.

616
00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:22.739
Anthony Taylor: So I've basically taken it out of the list. Put it into variable.

617
00:55:22.810 --> 00:55:29.579
Anthony Taylor: This is really helpful. If you have like a list of activities or a list of things that you need like. Say, you need to make a

618
00:55:29.590 --> 00:55:30.979
Anthony Taylor: a mailing list.

619
00:55:31.550 --> 00:55:34.279
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And you have a list of names.

620
00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:42.759
Anthony Taylor: and that you need on there. So you could actually say, Hey, pop that name out, put it here, you know, and then go pop that address out of a different list whatever.

621
00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:46.009
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then it just slowly

622
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:53.820
Anthony Taylor: pulls it all out. Now, I'm gonna tell you guys, III want you to remember this. I want us to move forward. And here's what I'm going to tell you.

623
00:55:54.010 --> 00:56:02.590
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I almost never have to spot, because I'm going to show you a better way to do it in a few minutes. Alright, but it's good to know how to do it.

624
00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:08.049
Anthony Taylor: Okay. alright. So here's another list. This list is somebody's grades

625
00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:11.550
Anthony Taylor: classroom of grades.

626
00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:18.419
Anthony Taylor: So here we're going to call some methods. Now. this is important. Look at what we got here.

627
00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:24.749
Anthony Taylor: This is that F string we talked about yesterday, right? Which means I can put

628
00:56:25.070 --> 00:56:29.639
Anthony Taylor: variables and or python code inside of a curly bracket.

629
00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:33.590
Anthony Taylor: So the Max method

630
00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:39.380
Anthony Taylor: passing in the list will give me the highest value

631
00:56:39.490 --> 00:56:50.430
Anthony Taylor: in that list. Got it so print, Max. Score 96. If I see that by good with that.

632
00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:52.410
Anthony Taylor: okay.

633
00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:57.780
Anthony Taylor: Min, another method does. The opposite gives me the lowest score.

634
00:56:59.610 --> 00:57:06.470
Anthony Taylor: Okay. some adds them all up. gives me the total score

635
00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:10.280
Anthony Taylor: length.

636
00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:17.710
Anthony Taylor: Do I even have to say it tells me how many items are in my list?

637
00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:29.879
Anthony Taylor: Hi, now, did it start with 0? No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. There's no you can't. You can't say how many items? 0. But there's actually one sorry.

638
00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:33.790
Anthony Taylor: It's even python's not that. Okay.

639
00:57:34.130 --> 00:57:37.440
Anthony Taylor: average score. We all know this.

640
00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:46.899
Anthony Taylor: We're going to sum the total divided by the length get the average score. Is there a method that does this? Of course there is. But we're doing it the hard way.

641
00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:50.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

642
00:57:51.570 --> 00:57:56.959
Anthony Taylor: So what do we just cover. Max? Highest value in the list?

643
00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:02.450
Anthony Taylor: Min. Lowest value in the list. some total, the list

644
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:05.650
Anthony Taylor: link. How many items in the list?

645
00:58:07.110 --> 00:58:07.950
Anthony Taylor: That's it.

646
00:58:09.770 --> 00:58:21.240
Anthony Taylor: Alright. I know this particular. This first lecture is a lot. Okay. I got it alright. Now, one more list thing, and we're almost done. Okay. A tuple.

647
00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:27.190
Anthony Taylor: I know there's some funny names and open source stuff. Alright. But a Tuple

648
00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:30.599
Anthony Taylor: is basically an immutable list.

649
00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:38.589
Anthony Taylor: I know if there's nobody. If everybody in here knows what a beautiful list is. You are smarter than I am.

650
00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:44.390
Anthony Taylor: Okay. What that means is, I can't change a value in this list.

651
00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:46.850
Anthony Taylor: Now, why is that of any value at all?

652
00:58:47.410 --> 00:58:48.680
Anthony Taylor: Anybody guess

653
00:58:51.200 --> 00:59:04.690
Meredith McCanse (she/her): if it's going to be some sort of reference that needs to stay fixed? Possibly that that's that's a great use of it. Why would it be a benefit to have a list? That's I mean, you could do same thing with.

654
00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:08.600
sonja baro: You won't make a mistake, or it won't change on you.

655
00:59:09.250 --> 00:59:12.529
sonja baro: It's also a good use case. Oh, sorry, alright.

656
00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:14.240
Anthony Taylor: no, it's good.

657
00:59:15.330 --> 00:59:16.370
Anthony Taylor: What, Rodney?

658
00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:35.489
Masarirambi, Rodney: Oh, I was gonna say so for some things that you cannot afford to have like change, the value of anything like somebody's date of birth, or something like that. Then, having an immutable list is gonna be the only way to do that, because otherwise, if it can change, then the date of birth can change, then everything may change and break.

659
00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:50.249
Anthony Taylor: That's true. And and and I like that. That's actually really good thought. I will tell you. There's other ways to do that with a regular list. And and it's not as looking for. So I'm just gonna give it to you, because probably II think it may be a Matt Hurry might know.

660
00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:57.679
Anthony Taylor: But no curry went off to eat a sandwich. So no, basically.

661
00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:07.040
Anthony Taylor: if it can't be changed. I don't have to worry about have to track it. I don't have to do anything with it, so it is very fast.

662
01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:12.550
Anthony Taylor: So python, for the most part, is not a fast lingua.

663
01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:22.930
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's I mean, it's the most used language pretty much in the world now, besides HTML and Javascript. But it's not really that fast in comparison.

664
01:00:23.810 --> 01:00:33.689
Anthony Taylor: So does that matter too much. Not really. I just like to talk. I like, Okay, here we go. So there's what it looks like. The only difference.

665
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:39.469
Anthony Taylor: It has parentheses around it instead of square brackets. That's it.

666
01:00:40.530 --> 01:00:49.810
Anthony Taylor: Pretty much. Everything else works the same except you can't edit it. Okay? So if we come down here, we create a name Tuple. We can do that.

667
01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:53.520
Anthony Taylor: We can get the link, the Max, the min. No problem.

668
01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:57.690
Anthony Taylor: We can create a guess. We can sum.

669
01:00:59.410 --> 01:01:01.509
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you just can't change it.

670
01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:02.729
Anthony Taylor: that's it

671
01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:09.969
Anthony Taylor: unless you change the whole thing. Now, I do want to say that. So like, I have this info tuple.

672
01:01:10.610 --> 01:01:12.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay. copy it.

673
01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:17.409
Anthony Taylor:  If I go down here and paste it.

674
01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:21.989
Anthony Taylor: Now, here it is. and it looks great right?

675
01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:26.400
Anthony Taylor:  And I said, you can't change it. Well.

676
01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:34.680
Anthony Taylor: you can't change an individual value. But if I wanted to change this to Bob, and this to Sue.

677
01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:36.820
Anthony Taylor: and this to 10,

678
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:40.739
Anthony Taylor: I can do that. I can override it the whole thing.

679
01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:43.769
Anthony Taylor: but I can't change an individual but

680
01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:45.990
Anthony Taylor: got it.

681
01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:55.919
Anthony Taylor: We use Tuples occasionally, but not tons. Tuples are pretty common in the machine learning. But most of the time you probably won't even realize you're doing

682
01:01:57.260 --> 01:02:00.959
Anthony Taylor: alright. But it's important that you know what it is.

683
01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:05.650
Anthony Taylor: Okay, there's a lot of things. I'm gonna show you that you may use a lot.

684
01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:16.819
Anthony Taylor: I'll point those out, and that you may not use a lot. But you need to know what it is. I guarantee you you go to an interview for python. Somebody's gonna bring up this doors.

685
01:02:17.830 --> 01:02:21.889
Anthony Taylor: and if you miss that question, that'll be a very short interview.

686
01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:25.980
Anthony Taylor: Okay, okay.

687
01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:27.150
let's move up.

688
01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:35.380
Anthony Taylor: So you guys are ready to try to use this. Now let me just show you guys something real quick. One more time I might have shown this to you already.

689
01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:37.519
Anthony Taylor: Remember.

690
01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:43.600
Anthony Taylor: in Vs code, you can create a split window. You can close this one.

691
01:02:43.730 --> 01:02:45.000
Anthony Taylor: and

692
01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:51.669
Anthony Taylor: you can close that one, and you can literally have it right next to each other while you're working.

693
01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:55.880
Anthony Taylor: So, my demo and the the exercise.

694
01:02:57.110 --> 01:03:01.350
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Will you show what you sorry I looked down.

695
01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:09.470
Anthony Taylor: No watch. drag. See how it's kind of gray. Now see how I put it over there and write.

696
01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:20.969
Anthony Taylor: Put it down your bottom top left whatever you like. let go, and then it'll add, and then this side you can still change tabs. But this idle stays stable. So you can.

697
01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:28.339
Anthony Taylor: And you can actually drag the tabs over if you really want to. and just have 2 windows all the time.

698
01:03:30.490 --> 01:03:41.630
Anthony Taylor: Okay, the split questions split screen. Icon does the same, doesn't it? Over to the right? Probably. Yeah. Let's see if you have one highlighted.

699
01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:53.069
Anthony Taylor: No, the one there it is next to your your settings. What's that called a little gromit or gasket right there.

700
01:03:53.310 --> 01:03:55.049
Anthony Taylor: It's the right. The gear

701
01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:56.589
sonja baro: go to the right.

702
01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:59.759
Anthony Taylor: Right. This guy. There we go.

703
01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:08.079
sonja baro: you know, gear gasket. Same thing, though it looks like it duplicated, though

704
01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:15.049
Anthony Taylor: it did, which is fine. That's fine, too.

705
01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:19.410
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So first off, you guys already like, Nope, looks better. Right?

706
01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:23.659
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Umhm. Yeah, they're awesome. What's your question, son?

707
01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:41.459
sonja baro: It was on. So let me see, where was, it was I was trying to understand the so you have the Max, the men, and then the lyn length. Right? Yeah. And one of the answers. It was referencing.

708
01:04:41.610 --> 01:04:48.760
sonja baro: it was referencing the for men or no. Sorry for Max. It was where the names are. So

709
01:04:48.850 --> 01:04:54.720
sonja baro: Jason, Melanie, Jacinta. Oh, because it did a match. Indian. Jacinta.

710
01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:58.579
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, that's always been careful with that.

711
01:04:59.590 --> 01:05:00.350
Anthony Taylor: Go ahead.

712
01:05:01.490 --> 01:05:10.080
Anthony Taylor: I'm trying to find where it was because it didn't. Yeah. So then, if you run it.

713
01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:13.810
sonja baro: It was okay. So Yindy

714
01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:22.300
sonja baro: isn't the Max. Why, why is it the Max? That's why I'm confused. Because Max y. Is after Mj. And L.

715
01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:28.140
sonja baro: Oh, so it was going after.

716
01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:30.379
sonja baro: like, I alphabetized it.

717
01:05:30.810 --> 01:05:31.820
sonja baro: Okay.

718
01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:35.789
Anthony Taylor: but let me show you something. Let me show you something.

719
01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:37.620
Anthony Taylor: Okay, watch this

720
01:05:37.810 --> 01:05:39.459
sonja baro: now. It's gonna change.

721
01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:45.620
Anthony Taylor: Oh, no, it actually worked. I thought it didn't pay attention to Case. But anyway, yeah, it's alphabetizing.

722
01:05:46.450 --> 01:05:47.780
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's all.

723
01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:52.310
sonja baro: So I was like, Wait. I didn't follow. Why, that was gonna be the Max. Okay?

724
01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:58.140
sonja baro: And how do you know that like cause? If it you use some other value.

725
01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:01.240
sonja baro: then Max means what?

726
01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:03.979
Anthony Taylor: Well, if you put a number in here.

727
01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:07.700
Anthony Taylor: it's number right? Hold on.

728
01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:20.129
Anthony Taylor: actually. Oh, yeah, no, it'll be. It's going to give us a tight error. Okay? Because we're doing minute, Max. And we have a combination right? It doesn't know what to do with that.

729
01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:35.740
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so if if you're gonna do min and match. You have to add the same data type. Now, you could have integers and floats. But basically the same major type like strings versus numbers.

730
01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:39.460
sonja baro: Yeah, so find something that is

731
01:06:39.630 --> 01:06:43.250
sonja baro: sequent or common amongst them, which was

732
01:06:43.310 --> 01:06:48.739
sonja baro: these are words, we're going to alphabetize them, I guess. Yeah.

733
01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:52.990
Anthony Taylor: Good work. Good question, yeah, any other questions.

734
01:06:53.370 --> 01:06:54.440
Raugewitz, Tania: So

735
01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:57.170
Raugewitz, Tania: in terms of the the min and Max

736
01:06:57.620 --> 01:07:06.620
Raugewitz, Tania: are those basically the 2 types of if it's number, it's gonna it's gonna be the highest number, lowest number, and if it's a string.

737
01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:11.830
Raugewitz, Tania: is it alphabetical? And are there those only 2 groups?

738
01:07:12.530 --> 01:07:14.600
Raugewitz, Tania: Herman and Max?

739
01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:19.500
Dipinto, Matt: Well, I mean

740
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:27.070
Anthony Taylor: Boolean would be 0 or one. So 0 is false, one is true. but would sort by false truth what was that man

741
01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:36.669
Dipinto, Matt: might be? Another thing I didn't actually know it'd be 0 on one that makes sense.

742
01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:44.889
Anthony Taylor: anybody else. You guys, I did say something. Kevin and I were talking about this the other day.

743
01:07:44.910 --> 01:07:47.569
Anthony Taylor: You guys are a great class. You ask

744
01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:59.080
Anthony Taylor: wonderful questions. Alright, do not stop doing that. I'm in a hurry, sure. but I'm never in too much of a hurry for us to get well, we will find time to do the work.

745
01:08:03.030 --> 01:08:05.649
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so here we go.

746
01:08:06.130 --> 01:08:11.040
Anthony Taylor: He's supposed to be fine. Derek got it. He was cool with it. It's like.

747
01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:14.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay, here we go. Let's get back to work

748
01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:20.060
Anthony Taylor: real quick. We'll go through that. That one. You guys already had the solution. How many of you looked at the solution?

749
01:08:23.439 --> 01:08:28.349
Anthony Taylor: See, I knew somebody would do it. I knew somebody would do it, and it was metal.

750
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:34.160
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this is why I don't give you guys a solution.

751
01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:35.490
Anthony Taylor: This is why.

752
01:08:35.729 --> 01:08:42.149
Anthony Taylor: cause you're gonna look at it. And then you're gonna know the answer without doing the work. So here we created a cool little tuple.

753
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:47.010
Anthony Taylor: and then we printed out the menu selections. Now we have a lid.

754
01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:51.680
Anthony Taylor: What's the difference between a list and tuple as far as syntax.

755
01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:55.599
Anthony Taylor: That's right, it's on your second.

756
01:08:56.660 --> 01:09:05.060
sonja baro: I knew that cause. I stumbled on that one, and we fixed it that I would tell you some. I've said this to you guys before.

757
01:09:05.279 --> 01:09:13.239
Anthony Taylor: when I started, no Internet. everything I learned was because I broke it and had to fix it. Okay, yeah. Click.

758
01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:17.849
Clayton Graves: why did you get the the blanks

759
01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:26.870
Clayton Graves: when we put blanks and we tried to do an an entry that had a blank in between 2 words, and it messed us up.

760
01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:41.429
Dipinto, Matt: Where do you see that? I don't see me doing that typed in? So we put a space in our entry when we had a user input and a

761
01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:44.450
Dipinto, Matt: but in terms of the creation.

762
01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:47.859
Anthony Taylor: yeah, this, you can have spaces of it.

763
01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:49.689
Anthony Taylor: Yeah.

764
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:53.460
Okay, here's that input what dessert would you like to add.

765
01:09:54.710 --> 01:09:56.290
Anthony Taylor: Tira Masood?

766
01:09:57.730 --> 01:10:00.310
Anthony Taylor: I don't know how to spell it. Tart.

767
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:05.940
Anthony Taylor: Okay? And then there it is, let's look, how much does this dessert cost?

768
01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:07.610
Anthony Taylor: 7.

769
01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:12.490
Anthony Taylor: Okay, then I can print them out. Tart

770
01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:22.050
Anthony Taylor: 7 to expensive parts. Alright. Now I can remove items, move an item. What item I don't think we covered remove, did we?

771
01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:23.619
Anthony Taylor: Did you guys get to this?

772
01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:27.120
Anthony Taylor: By the way, I love athletic

773
01:10:27.850 --> 01:10:31.150
Anthony Taylor: near Denver? I would let you make.

774
01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:33.900
Anthony Taylor: It's the only gift I would accept.

775
01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:37.970
Anthony Taylor: What was that? Nobody got to remove?

776
01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:39.890
Meredith McCanse (she/her): We covered anybody, get

777
01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:48.620
Masarirambi, Rodney: we? We were starting that but we? But you were asking like, did we cover that? We cover that? I don't think before. And

778
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:50.139
Masarirambi, Rodney: it did, pop?

779
01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:53.840
Anthony Taylor: Oh, yeah, I remember now you're right. Here it is.

780
01:10:54.160 --> 01:11:00.150
Anthony Taylor: We moved. Come out excellent. See? Sometimes. I don't even realize what I do

781
01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:05.560
Anthony Taylor: alright. And then we get the index of item. We get to move it.

782
01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:08.400
We can get. We can pop an item

783
01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:10.969
Anthony Taylor: we can get deserves

784
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:21.699
Anthony Taylor: very exciting. Okay, so what they do here, let's talk about what they did here. I kinda glossed over. They got the index of the item that I wanted them to move. I said, Boot have know about

785
01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:23.590
Anthony Taylor: okay.

786
01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:30.920
Anthony Taylor: Then they said, Remove that index or that item. Sorry the Pavlova.

787
01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.420
Anthony Taylor: And then

788
01:11:33.670 --> 01:11:37.390
Anthony Taylor: they popped under the prices list. They popped

789
01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:42.139
Anthony Taylor: the index of that. So if pat. Well, what was index? 3.

790
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:45.510
Anthony Taylor: Here, they said, pop, the third price out.

791
01:11:46.690 --> 01:12:02.889
Anthony Taylor: okay? And then that was $6 and 99 cents, because Pavlova was $6 and 99 cents. Okay. what else? Most expensive. Now, we're just gonna do. Max, min, max.

792
01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:04.560
Anthony Taylor: min.

793
01:12:05.370 --> 01:12:11.569
Anthony Taylor: How? What how would it cost if you bought everything, $19 and 74 cent. This is my weakness.

794
01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:21.930
Anthony Taylor: Every time I go to a bakery. I'm like, I need that and that and that attack. Okay? And then I don't need it. And then how many desserts do we have? We have 4

795
01:12:24.150 --> 01:12:26.030
Anthony Taylor: pretty exciting questions.

796
01:12:27.330 --> 01:12:29.580
Anthony Taylor: Not a lot to talk about there, really. Huh?

797
01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:42.929
Anthony Taylor: Hi, so we should be a break right? It's it's it's break time for you. Is it? Break time for you? Yeah, it's break time for you. We are way behind only like 6 lessons.

798
01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:51.199
Anthony Taylor: So let's take break feedback promptly adds. age 22.

799
01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:53.840
Anthony Taylor: Okay, see you? Then.

800
01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:07.400
Anthony Taylor: Kevin Jays. they literally just asked me at the last break could they start handling the recording because I screw it up all the time?

801
01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:09.540
Anthony Taylor: And look at that alright.

802
01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:30.459
Anthony Taylor: Stand by. Let me just do this real quick for recording. Hi, everybody welcome back conditional. That's like, if then else else, if they're really cool and super important. Here's if if else L, if they wanted to save 2 letters. So they did. Lf, and said, else it here's an example of an if, then else. So if it's this, do this, otherwise, do this.

803
01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:38.320
Anthony Taylor: Okay, here's an if else. If so, if this is true, we're going this way. If it's false, we're going this way, or.

804
01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:42.639
Anthony Taylor: if it was equal, we could do an actual third one, which would be an else.

805
01:13:43.190 --> 01:13:51.910
Anthony Taylor: Here's all the different ones greater than greater than, or equal to less than less than or equal to equal to notice. 2 equals? Not one. Why

806
01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:54.280
Anthony Taylor: one equals. How we do a variable.

807
01:13:54.370 --> 01:13:58.590
Anthony Taylor: not equals is exclamation point equals, which

808
01:13:58.790 --> 01:14:02.760
Anthony Taylor: exclamation point is often not in I.

809
01:14:04.350 --> 01:14:09.090
Anthony Taylor: So if you're watching this on video, remember, you can slow all that down. That was second time.

810
01:14:09.730 --> 01:14:11.819
Anthony Taylor: Okay, in case you forgot.

811
01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:23.119
Anthony Taylor:  I don't know if anyone has trouble remembering less than or greater than I have this thing, and I literally still say it in my head every single time

812
01:14:24.630 --> 01:14:27.600
Anthony Taylor: less than points to the left.

813
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:32.329
Anthony Taylor: Every time I say.

814
01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:41.390
Anthony Taylor: like, every time I go to type, wait, list. That's a hungry alligator, and he's always gonna go eat the bigger.

815
01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:47.639
Anthony Taylor: That's that's that works. Sounds like Sonya goes that way, too.

816
01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:49.410
Raugewitz, Tania: Me, too.

817
01:14:49.450 --> 01:14:55.820
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Well, maybe left is easier than thinking of a violent scene on National Geographic.

818
01:14:56.290 --> 01:14:57.340
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

819
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:59.809
Anthony Taylor: Okay. So

820
01:15:00.150 --> 01:15:07.879
Anthony Taylor: input validation. So conditions are great for that. we can pass in a method.

821
01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:13.330
Anthony Taylor: and we can pass, and we can say, Hey, if it's string, or if it if it

822
01:15:13.410 --> 01:15:15.150
Anthony Taylor: is a string.

823
01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.519
Anthony Taylor: then convert it to a number.

824
01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:26.729
Anthony Taylor: Alright. That's one thing. With conditionals, and we'll all you'll see this when we code it here. We're gonna code it right now.

825
01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:28.829
Anthony Taylor: Well, we're gonna see it coded.

826
01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:33.110
Anthony Taylor: So we have 2 variables. X and Y. By the way.

827
01:15:33.130 --> 01:15:34.569
Anthony Taylor: make sure you've got a kernel.

828
01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:40.950
Anthony Taylor: This is one of those places where I wanted to show you guys the variables thing. If you click variables, you can see X and Y

829
01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:45.080
Anthony Taylor: alright. You see what those values are that's going to be handy throughout this exercise.

830
01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:47.680
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

831
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:54.369
Anthony Taylor: If x equals equals one print X is equal to what?

832
01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:59.490
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Now, if we did this with just one equals, it will fail.

833
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:05.260
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's like what? What? What? What makes no sense.

834
01:16:05.850 --> 01:16:10.349
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we put in another equals. And then like magic, it will work.

835
01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:19.510
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so this is just the base condition. Now, most important thing to remember about this in Python. In fact, all of Python.

836
01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:29.840
Anthony Taylor: you must indent. So if we were typing this in a new cell note. By the way, how I get a new cell. I just put my mouse in the middle here and then push code.

837
01:16:29.930 --> 01:16:34.679
Anthony Taylor: And now I have himself. Okay. So if I say, if

838
01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:38.789
Anthony Taylor: X equals equals one Colon.

839
01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:40.829
Anthony Taylor: when I hit enter.

840
01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:44.890
Anthony Taylor: it's going to automatically go where it needs to go.

841
01:16:45.970 --> 01:16:51.610
Anthony Taylor: Okay, notice, it's indented. Okay? So I can say, Print Duh

842
01:16:52.840 --> 01:17:06.749
Anthony Taylor: alright and see how it's indented. That's how we know what to do. If this condition is true. everything that is indented after that Colon will be executed.

843
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:11.120
Anthony Taylor: not killed. just execute.

844
01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:13.410
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

845
01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:19.909
Anthony Taylor: So here, if y is not equal to one

846
01:17:20.190 --> 01:17:23.149
Anthony Taylor: friends. Why is that equal to what poop?

847
01:17:25.190 --> 01:17:27.860
Anthony Taylor: Okay, if X is less than y

848
01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:35.110
Anthony Taylor: print x is less than y. If y is greater than X. Yes, I'm

849
01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:42.169
sonja baro: so I just wanted to check on the colon is equal to the invent. Is that what

850
01:17:42.650 --> 01:17:54.770
Anthony Taylor: colon is the end? As a syntax thing. Okay, all it does is tell Python that we are done with the condition. because, as you are going to find out, these conditions can be rather wrong.

851
01:17:56.090 --> 01:17:59.990
Anthony Taylor: Typically some. They're not always this. No, go ahead, sir.

852
01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:04.830
sonja baro: no, no, I so so call equals end of the condition

853
01:18:05.230 --> 01:18:10.010
Anthony Taylor: of the condition correct. And then, after the colon, you have to indent

854
01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:11.800
sonja baro: on the next slide

855
01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:15.980
Anthony Taylor: right? And everything that is indented at this level

856
01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:24.179
Anthony Taylor: will execute. So everything so like, if I hit. Enter here. See how the cursor is staying at that line. That column.

857
01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:29.730
Anthony Taylor: Okay, anything I type will be executed as soon as I tap back over. It's over

858
01:18:29.890 --> 01:18:30.880
Anthony Taylor: stops

859
01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:36.070
Anthony Taylor: now. It doesn't mean it stops running. It means it's no longer part of the condition.

860
01:18:36.230 --> 01:18:40.220
Anthony Taylor: which means, Here, let's do this print.

861
01:18:42.990 --> 01:18:50.520
Anthony Taylor: Okay, and then here we're going to get to else in a minute. But I'll go ahead and show you else now. So if I come here.

862
01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:57.620
Anthony Taylor: actually, no, let's just do this. So we'll say, this is less than so. We know that y is greater than X.

863
01:18:57.700 --> 01:19:00.220
Anthony Taylor: So when this runs, what's going to happen?

864
01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:06.780
Anthony Taylor: Well, it's not going to show this at all. It's just going to show this. Okay?

865
01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:14.150
Anthony Taylor: Oh, all right, cause this was false doesn't show it. Now, if we flip this back around.

866
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:21.860
Anthony Taylor: it's still it's gonna run. It's gonna print this, and it's gonna print this because this is the next thing

867
01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:26.190
Anthony Taylor: at this level to to cope, to run.

868
01:19:26.670 --> 01:19:29.430
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I continuing, for

869
01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:34.500
Anthony Taylor: if X is at greater than or equal to one Yay

870
01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:39.589
Anthony Taylor: congratulations equals true, that is Boolean.

871
01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:43.770
Anthony Taylor: So if alright. So here's the thing.

872
01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:47.119
Anthony Taylor: and this is why they want me to show you this. This is important.

873
01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:53.630
Anthony Taylor: A condition can only have 2 outcomes.

874
01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:02.499
Anthony Taylor: True? False. there is no other outcome.

875
01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:11.419
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so if I put a Boolean in here, that is, in fact, true.

876
01:20:12.410 --> 01:20:14.310
Anthony Taylor: The outcome is true.

877
01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:21.789
Anthony Taylor: Got it. If I put a boolean in here, there. The outcome is false, the outcome is false, and it'll go to the next.

878
01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:26.109
Anthony Taylor: It'll go to the else in this case. So here congratulations!

879
01:20:26.270 --> 01:20:29.820
Anthony Taylor: If I change it to, don't congratulate

880
01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:33.640
Anthony Taylor: and then run it again. How are you feeling?

881
01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:36.869
Anthony Taylor: See how it did that now it ran

882
01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:43.350
Anthony Taylor: the else portion. So let's look at this syntax. Colin. in Dent.

883
01:20:44.050 --> 01:20:52.640
Anthony Taylor: But whatever we want to do, and it's not one line. Usually it could be thousands of lines. Normally, it's tens or 20 s. Of lines.

884
01:20:52.870 --> 01:20:59.330
Anthony Taylor: all right, and then an else the else is at the same level as the if.

885
01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:05.170
Anthony Taylor: That's how we know this else belongs to this if

886
01:21:06.370 --> 01:21:07.550
Anthony Taylor: Colon

887
01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:13.709
Anthony Taylor: indent everything after that indent or that even equal to this indent

888
01:21:14.150 --> 01:21:17.930
Anthony Taylor: will run after the else. Got it

889
01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:20.160
Anthony Taylor: awesome.

890
01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:34.810
Anthony Taylor: Here's an input, what number would you like me to check? 7? That's a U. 7. Enter. Okay. Now it's stored in that variable. How do I know I can go to variables. Look, user, input.

891
01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:37.650
Anthony Taylor: it's a 70, this is interesting.

892
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:40.090
Anthony Taylor: It's a string.

893
01:21:42.130 --> 01:21:46.880
Anthony Taylor: Hmm. if user input is digit

894
01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:54.569
Anthony Taylor: number int user input print's input number is a number

895
01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:58.680
Anthony Taylor: else print user input is not a number. So let's run. This

896
01:21:59.190 --> 01:22:06.019
Anthony Taylor: 7 is a number. Now, it knew it was a string, but the is digit just checks. Is that string a number.

897
01:22:06.810 --> 01:22:10.850
Anthony Taylor: So if we run this again and we do F

898
01:22:11.980 --> 01:22:13.000
Anthony Taylor: enter.

899
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:15.980
Anthony Taylor: Now it's an F we run. This

900
01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:17.340
Anthony Taylor: F is not alone.

901
01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:21.860
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Questions.

902
01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:28.330
Anthony Taylor: Most important thing here. If condition is it true? False ends with a colon.

903
01:22:28.850 --> 01:22:40.949
Anthony Taylor: the next line is indented. What do you want to do when you're done, you indent back out if you need to do it, else you indent back out if you needed to do an else, if which sure right, we don't have a demo, else. If

904
01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:43.599
Anthony Taylor: Elsif works like

905
01:22:44.850 --> 01:22:51.640
Anthony Taylor:  let's make a new cell. and we'll do if

906
01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:55.150
Anthony Taylor: I don't know what variable. How about X

907
01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:56.800
Anthony Taylor: is

908
01:22:56.820 --> 01:23:01.370
Anthony Taylor: greater than one or greater than 0 Colon.

909
01:23:04.930 --> 01:23:06.390
Anthony Taylor: It is greater than 0.

910
01:23:07.210 --> 01:23:10.580
Anthony Taylor: So no, we don't want to do that let's do greater than one.

911
01:23:11.470 --> 01:23:12.270
Anthony Taylor: They didn't.

912
01:23:13.370 --> 01:23:15.200
Anthony Taylor: Okay, because it's not greater than

913
01:23:17.170 --> 01:23:31.359
Anthony Taylor: alright. And when we could say x. and then we can say Ellif. and then. Now we're going to give it another condition. and it's an if condition. So again, we can say, X

914
01:23:31.450 --> 01:23:34.160
Anthony Taylor: is greater than 5.

915
01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:40.490
Anthony Taylor: But we need to put a colon in. That's so wrong. No, no, that's right. There's the quote.

916
01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:44.899
Anthony Taylor: okay? And then here we'll say print. I don't know.

917
01:23:46.210 --> 01:23:53.340
Anthony Taylor: This is not right? Okay? And then, lastly, we can say, else.

918
01:23:54.710 --> 01:23:56.739
Anthony Taylor: Grant, just do this.

919
01:23:58.070 --> 01:24:02.830
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so basically, we're gonna check this condition. If it's true, we're gonna print X,

920
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:08.809
Anthony Taylor: then we're going to check. If it's not true, we'll check this condition. That one's not true.

921
01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:16.629
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we're going to do, or that one is true. We'll do this. If it's not true, no matter what it is, we're going to do this.

922
01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:29.919
Anthony Taylor: This is basically like. I don't know what the heck it is. Just do this. Okay? So we can run that. And we can say and see it went to else, because one was 0 r, one was X was one.

923
01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:34.789
Anthony Taylor: so it was not greater, it was not greater than one, and it was not greater than 5.

924
01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:37.590
Anthony Taylor: So therefore it went to the else.

925
01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:39.680
Anthony Taylor: got it.

926
01:24:40.170 --> 01:24:43.220
Derek Rikke: wait in this example. If X is 6,

927
01:24:43.530 --> 01:24:53.589
Anthony Taylor: it'll just run the first one, right, it'll it won't run out exactly. I know it's a terrible example from from a logic perspective, but it does show if else it else

928
01:24:53.800 --> 01:25:01.399
Anthony Taylor: we probably have another example. That's a great point. If X. This would not be a good thing to run if you were actually trying to find out what X was.

929
01:25:01.670 --> 01:25:09.190
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But I didn't want to put less than 5, because that would've definitely come back also. because was less than 5. Aye.

930
01:25:09.610 --> 01:25:11.360
Anthony Taylor: so yeah, there's all kinds of fun stuff.

931
01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:18.320
Anthony Taylor: But that's good. II think Curry was. Gonna say that, too, Derek. I'm just going to put you 2 right next to each other. Now.

932
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:22.409
Anthony Taylor: these guys alright, any questions

933
01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:25.650
Anthony Taylor: send you guys away to give this a try

934
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:31.700
Anthony Taylor: it. Where?

935
01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:34.420
Anthony Taylor: What do they want you to see?

936
01:25:36.230 --> 01:25:37.150
Anthony Taylor: Oh.

937
01:25:37.650 --> 01:25:42.450
Anthony Taylor: I think all they actually you know what? Let's just make this an everyone, because it's all done. There's no code.

938
01:25:42.990 --> 01:25:51.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay. What they want you do before we run it. Tell us if it's true, we're gonna play game. Nobody run any code.

939
01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:53.220
Anthony Taylor: Only I will

940
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:57.900
Anthony Taylor: please. Okay. here we go.

941
01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:01.520
Anthony Taylor: Is this gonna work.

942
01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:04.650
Anthony Taylor: Is this true? Or is this false?

943
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:09.109
Dipinto, Matt: That's false?

944
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:11.419
Anthony Taylor: It's false. Why?

945
01:26:12.150 --> 01:26:14.400
Dipinto, Matt: Because 2 times X is equal to 10.

946
01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:21.329
Anthony Taylor: Exactly. So this is, gonna say, some work. This is the game we're gonna play here. Right? Somebody else.

947
01:26:21.850 --> 01:26:23.070
Anthony Taylor: Number 2.

948
01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:25.979
Anthony Taylor: Is it right wrong.

949
01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:28.259
Anthony Taylor: What's the answer? Going to be

950
01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:31.920
Derek Rikke: right? Right?

951
01:26:33.190 --> 01:26:40.319
Anthony Taylor: If length of dog is less than XY. Cause I got a Wiener dog, and it's pretty long. I don't have Wiener.

952
01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:42.379
Anthony Taylor: I have a big bet on

953
01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:44.740
Meredith McCanse (she/her): bye, Derek.

954
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:46.519
Meredith McCanse (she/her): Oh, wait! Who said it?

955
01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:55.210
Anthony Taylor: Who said Meredith said, exactly, dog is 3 letters, so it says is 3, less than 5.  that one works.

956
01:26:55.960 --> 01:27:01.530
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Number 3. This one's a hard one. What's this one?

957
01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:06.490
Anthony Taylor: Does everybody remember what 2 asterisks means?

958
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:08.410
michael mcpherson: Yes, exponent.

959
01:27:09.310 --> 01:27:12.270
Anthony Taylor: It's an exponent, was that the answer? It's true.

960
01:27:12.710 --> 01:27:13.560
michael mcpherson: True.

961
01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:18.049
Anthony Taylor: So 2 to the third power is greater than or equal to y

962
01:27:19.770 --> 01:27:22.469
Anthony Taylor: to the third power. Let's find out.

963
01:27:22.650 --> 01:27:33.799
Anthony Taylor: Boo! Got it nice job alright. Next one country. Madagascar. If country equals equals Madagascar.

964
01:27:33.930 --> 01:27:39.770
Anthony Taylor: then the countries in Africa, it's not. It's not in Africa said, which one's gonna print.

965
01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:42.710
michael mcpherson: Second

966
01:27:44.930 --> 01:27:46.360
Anthony Taylor: second one. Why.

967
01:27:49.940 --> 01:28:02.380
Anthony Taylor: geography doesn't matter

968
01:28:02.590 --> 01:28:05.600
Anthony Taylor: just if this is right or wrong.

969
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:08.830
sonja baro: I think it's gonna be in Africa.

970
01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:12.640
Raugewitz, Tania: But I think it's gonna not be enough.

971
01:28:13.930 --> 01:28:15.799
Clayton Graves: The condition is true.

972
01:28:15.970 --> 01:28:19.480
Anthony Taylor: Condition is true. So it's in Africa. According to this.

973
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:25.559
Anthony Taylor: I know maybe it's not Mike. That's fine. We're not doing geography.

974
01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:32.460
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So is it. The gap going places equals true?

975
01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:36.620
Anthony Taylor: What's gonna print? You're going places, or you prefer to stay at home

976
01:28:36.670 --> 01:28:39.270
Anthony Taylor: doesn't matter. If you want to stay at home, Mike.

977
01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:46.490
Anthony Taylor: Going places. going places right? Why? Because it's true. It says so right there.

978
01:28:47.150 --> 01:28:54.619
Anthony Taylor: Alright, alright! Here's another one. This one is interesting. Altitude equals 66,000

979
01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:00.250
Gebrekristos, Hafton: cannot be converted to a number

980
01:29:00.790 --> 01:29:15.800
Anthony Taylor: half.  you guys are really pretty good at this. Now, what if I remove just the comma? It's still a string.

981
01:29:15.810 --> 01:29:17.369
Anthony Taylor: Will it work, or will it not? Work?

982
01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:18.710
Gebrekristos, Hafton: Will work

983
01:29:19.970 --> 01:29:28.550
Clayton Graves: that can use something else other than a comma like maybe an underscore. Nope, make it easier for human to read, but still work.

984
01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:35.020
Raugewitz, Tania: Nope, if it has to be full, everything in the string has to be a number for is digit to work.

985
01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:38.170
Dipinto, Matt: That's a good question. Yeah, that was fun. Right?

986
01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:43.420
michael mcpherson: Located at 60,000 with the company.

987
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:48.430
Anthony Taylor: No triple quotes just allows you to put spaces, our enters and stuff.

988
01:29:48.770 --> 01:29:58.090
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, no, that doesn't alright. So here's some complex conditionals. Whoosh! So we're going to start with one and 10 again.

989
01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:08.770
Anthony Taylor: Okay. and we're gonna add. And or so, remember, I told you the Comp, the the conditions can get rather long.

990
01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:14.059
Anthony Taylor: So here we're gonna say, if X equals one and y equals 10

991
01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:17.539
Anthony Taylor: print that both values return true.

992
01:30:18.690 --> 01:30:22.100
Anthony Taylor: everybody understand that so and means

993
01:30:22.170 --> 01:30:24.420
Anthony Taylor: both conditions

994
01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:25.970
Anthony Taylor: are true.

995
01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:35.810
Anthony Taylor: Got it. If X is less than 45, or Y is less than 5,

996
01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:41.259
Anthony Taylor: or Oh, what happens? Sorry.

997
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:48.140
Anthony Taylor: No, I was saying, 1 one condition is true. Oh, yeah, yeah, no. These are all. Probably

998
01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:52.460
Anthony Taylor: the condition here for an, or means that

999
01:30:52.810 --> 01:30:55.010
Anthony Taylor: their condition

1000
01:30:55.090 --> 01:31:01.949
Anthony Taylor: can be true. or either, if either condition is true. then.

1001
01:31:02.210 --> 01:31:04.790
Anthony Taylor: it's going to come back as true.

1002
01:31:05.170 --> 01:31:06.699
Anthony Taylor: Okay, well, I need one.

1003
01:31:07.210 --> 01:31:18.310
Anthony Taylor: And this could be many. This could be or or or or basically and means. Everything has to be true, or it's 400 or means only one of it needs to be true.

1004
01:31:20.510 --> 01:31:25.520
Anthony Taylor: to to be tracked. Exactly. 1 one item has to be true.

1005
01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:29.579
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so this one says, if not

1006
01:31:29.930 --> 01:31:31.090
Anthony Taylor: condition.

1007
01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:37.060
Anthony Taylor: it's interesting. Huh? Why, it's gonna be red stuff. Oh, I got, I got a weird indentation.

1008
01:31:37.290 --> 01:31:43.470
Anthony Taylor: I do, too. Okay, shortcut highlight. The whole thing shift. Tab done.

1009
01:31:45.260 --> 01:31:55.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay. It just basically moved the whole block over one tab. It actually would have ran. By the way. if you do this. that will work.

1010
01:31:57.220 --> 01:32:00.949
Anthony Taylor: Oh, okay, not in Vs code. Sorry works, data bridge.

1011
01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:03.030
Anthony Taylor: Sometimes it will.

1012
01:32:03.290 --> 01:32:06.230
Anthony Taylor: But it's not a good practice. Always start on the list.

1013
01:32:07.260 --> 01:32:08.160
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1014
01:32:08.750 --> 01:32:16.779
Anthony Taylor: multiple conditions. So this is the Lcif stuff. So here plate spans. This is that there you go putting away dishes.

1015
01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:20.350
Anthony Taylor: If plate is cracked. throw the dish away.

1016
01:32:21.650 --> 01:32:25.639
Anthony Taylor: else if plate is fancy, put it on the top shelf.

1017
01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:30.210
Anthony Taylor: Now, do we need an else. If plate is not fancy. No.

1018
01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:35.569
Anthony Taylor: we only have 2 kinds of plates, so we can simply say, else Put the plate on the bottom shelf.

1019
01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:44.230
Anthony Taylor: Okay. have I got that multiple conditions? There's cooler ways to do multiple conditions later. Alright.

1020
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:47.930
Anthony Taylor: alright! Now this one I love this one. I actually it's quite a bit.

1021
01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.779
Anthony Taylor: In and not in.

1022
01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:52.360
Anthony Taylor: So we have 3 lists.

1023
01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:59.809
Anthony Taylor: We have a name. What I want to know is, which of these lists this name is in.

1024
01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:07.510
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so I can say, if name variable is in Group One.

1025
01:33:08.590 --> 01:33:09.619
Anthony Taylor: This group

1026
01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:14.899
Anthony Taylor: print name is in the first group. I don't know why they didn't do an F there. But whatever

1027
01:33:15.690 --> 01:33:20.130
Anthony Taylor: okay, else, if name is in Group 2, print this.

1028
01:33:20.170 --> 01:33:24.660
Anthony Taylor: if name is in Group 3, print this else this this name is not in a group.

1029
01:33:25.630 --> 01:33:28.220
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So in

1030
01:33:28.350 --> 01:33:33.690
Anthony Taylor: allows us to ask if any value is in any list.

1031
01:33:33.770 --> 01:33:34.970
Anthony Taylor: or Tuple

1032
01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:39.840
Anthony Taylor: got it in?

1033
01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:46.600
Anthony Taylor:  So yeah, which one is she? And she's in the third one. So we run this, we'll see.

1034
01:33:47.050 --> 01:33:48.329
Anthony Taylor: She's in Group 3.

1035
01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:53.709
Anthony Taylor: Okay, can you see how that might be helpful? That's gonna be helpful for sure.

1036
01:33:54.670 --> 01:33:56.719
Anthony Taylor: Alright.

1037
01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:59.140
Anthony Taylor: Now let me ask you a question.

1038
01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:05.410
Anthony Taylor: What if

1039
01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:09.790
Anthony Taylor: I said

1040
01:34:10.530 --> 01:34:12.660
Anthony Taylor: Group 3 right here

1041
01:34:16.410 --> 01:34:18.439
Anthony Taylor: and Group 2

1042
01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:21.570
Anthony Taylor: right here?

1043
01:34:24.020 --> 01:34:27.769
Clayton Graves: It's gonna stop. Once it gets to a a a true.

1044
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:31.379
Clayton Graves: it's gonna stop

1045
01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:38.950
Anthony Taylor: 100%. Clayton's on it, right? So when we do an if condition or an if block like this.

1046
01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:41.460
Anthony Taylor: whenever it's true it's over.

1047
01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:43.980
Anthony Taylor: it's over

1048
01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:49.540
Anthony Taylor: alright. As soon as it hits a true statement. It never sees the rest of this code.

1049
01:34:51.790 --> 01:34:55.670
Anthony Taylor: Alright. That's important to remember. You will make bugs because of this.

1050
01:34:56.710 --> 01:35:00.029
Anthony Taylor: Okay. all right, I'm putting Meredith to sleep

1051
01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:02.200
Anthony Taylor: and terrible.

1052
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:08.079
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I apologize. I'm a morning person. I'm not a night person. It's not you.

1053
01:35:08.590 --> 01:35:12.620
Anthony Taylor: It is right now I'm bored. So I gotta move. I gotta do something.

1054
01:35:13.090 --> 01:35:18.869
Meredith McCanse (she/her): I'm not bored. I just had a rough it didn't. I didn't get a lot of sleep last night. The cats! There were cat problems.

1055
01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:20.860
Anthony Taylor: Oh, my God.

1056
01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:24.270
Mason, Natalie: we need more oxygen because we're learning so much.

1057
01:35:25.050 --> 01:35:29.010
Anthony Taylor: That's what it is, or I'm sucking all the oxygen all the way from Denver.

1058
01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:36.299
sonja baro: We're flying at 66,000 feet.

1059
01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:43.059
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So here's a beaming long list. Okay, we just want to know if Kenya's in it.

1060
01:35:43.170 --> 01:35:47.610
Anthony Taylor: So if country, not in countries, just say it's not in that list. Oh.

1061
01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:55.270
Anthony Taylor: you got a bug? That's because I didn't run the list. Try that again. Andrea is not in Oceania. So basically, that's telling us, Kenya is not in

1062
01:35:56.490 --> 01:35:57.490
Anthony Taylor: okay?

1063
01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:01.260
Anthony Taylor:  we can also say, if

1064
01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:05.450
Anthony Taylor: so, okay, let's think about what is type countries going to return.

1065
01:36:06.140 --> 01:36:08.360
Anthony Taylor: Anybody know string?

1066
01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:10.530
Gebrekristos, Hafton: It's it. Well.

1067
01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:11.650
Anthony Taylor: is it?

1068
01:36:12.410 --> 01:36:14.130
Gebrekristos, Hafton: Oh, no list.

1069
01:36:14.450 --> 01:36:18.230
Anthony Taylor: Exactly right? Because country is itself

1070
01:36:19.170 --> 01:36:20.440
Anthony Taylor: is a list.

1071
01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:28.889
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So if type countries is a list. print countries is a list and it works

1072
01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:31.710
Anthony Taylor: alright.

1073
01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:39.889
Anthony Taylor: If it's not a list. Countries is not a list. Okay? Well, okay, country is not a list.

1074
01:36:39.910 --> 01:36:42.489
Anthony Taylor: And it's not. Country is a string.

1075
01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:51.460
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so we can also check for like float or integer, we can say, if type of X was X,

1076
01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:57.560
Anthony Taylor: see, this is where we can just do our variables. X is Int, we can see that. So

1077
01:36:57.670 --> 01:37:00.869
Anthony Taylor: if Type X is a float that won't be true.

1078
01:37:01.190 --> 01:37:04.029
Anthony Taylor: If Type X is an int, that's gonna be true.

1079
01:37:04.230 --> 01:37:10.020
Anthony Taylor: else print. It's just not a number at all. and it is an int. As expected.

1080
01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:19.190
Anthony Taylor: I hear some more more variables. Height, 66, age 16. Adult permission is true. Oh, it's a pop quiz! Don't run it.

1081
01:37:21.490 --> 01:37:23.920
I want to see how to get this one right.

1082
01:37:25.900 --> 01:37:40.190
Anthony Taylor: I'll read it. If height is greater than 70, and age is greater than or equal to 18. Print can ride all roller coasters, else, if height is greater than 65, and age is greater than 18 print can ride moderate roller coasters.

1083
01:37:40.570 --> 01:37:56.659
Anthony Taylor: else, if height is greater than 60, and age is greater than equal to 18. Print. Can't write light roller coasters. else, if height is greater than 50, and age greater than 18 or adult mission and height is greater than 50

1084
01:37:57.250 --> 01:38:01.810
Anthony Taylor: can ride bumper cars. Alice, stick to the Lazy River.

1085
01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:06.859
michael mcpherson: Who's been enjoying them bumper cars, bumper cars?

1086
01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:11.840
Anthony Taylor: I hear a couple anybody disagree?

1087
01:38:12.550 --> 01:38:15.059
Derek Rikke: What'd you say, Derek? Lazy river!

1088
01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:27.529
Gebrekristos, Hafton: I go with leisure. River, too.

1089
01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:33.040
Anthony Taylor: Does anybody not think Lazy River or bumper cars? Let's go there. Let's start there.

1090
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:36.469
Anthony Taylor: Anybody wanna go somewhere else? Anyone just still? Not sure.

1091
01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:39.250
Anthony Taylor: still calculating.

1092
01:38:40.270 --> 01:38:41.830
Raugewitz, Tania: Oh.

1093
01:38:42.330 --> 01:38:45.219
Anthony Taylor: sad is Lazy River. Okay? Ahanya's lazy river.

1094
01:38:45.710 --> 01:38:51.170
sonja baro: No, yeah, I'm still calculating. I'm looking for adult permission where it was true. Which condition

1095
01:38:52.170 --> 01:38:56.420
sonja baro: there's only one place where there we go. Got it

1096
01:38:56.860 --> 01:39:06.510
Anthony Taylor: alright. So the answer is.

1097
01:39:06.610 --> 01:39:12.380
Anthony Taylor: oh, first you gotta run this one boom. Bopper's

1098
01:39:12.860 --> 01:39:14.110
Anthony Taylor: okay. Why

1099
01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:18.939
Anthony Taylor: height greater than 50, and age greater than 18. That's not true.

1100
01:39:19.590 --> 01:39:21.119
Gebrekristos, Hafton: At least one is true.

1101
01:39:21.590 --> 01:39:31.189
Anthony Taylor: Adult permission is true, and height greater than 50 is true. So this side is true. It's an or this went, oh.

1102
01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:38.539
Anthony Taylor: okay, they totally are messing with you there. But this isn't. This isn't a totally ridiculous block of code.

1103
01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:43.380
Anthony Taylor: Okay, you will have situations where you might have to do something like this. So

1104
01:39:43.490 --> 01:39:48.600
Anthony Taylor: the most important thing, if you have to do something like this, keep it clean.

1105
01:39:50.460 --> 01:40:03.009
Anthony Taylor: Okay, make sure that it's properly dented. There's nice spaces like they don't have any comments in here, but it's the challenge. So you know, put put comments in here that makes sense.

1106
01:40:03.670 --> 01:40:04.540
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

1107
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:06.980
Anthony Taylor: Awesome questions.

1108
01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:11.490
Anthony Taylor: Me see where we're at here.

1109
01:40:16.410 --> 01:40:22.159
Anthony Taylor: Hi, I think you guys can get. I think we might have to push one thing to next class. But that's okay.

1110
01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:24.390
Let's have you guys do this activity.

1111
01:40:26.190 --> 01:40:28.329
Anthony Taylor: So in this one.

1112
01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:35.189
Anthony Taylor: you've got a bunch of variables, and they want you to just write. Else if statement L, then I don't know additional

1113
01:40:35.890 --> 01:40:40.430
Anthony Taylor: to find out stuff about all of this data. Okay.

1114
01:40:41.290 --> 01:40:46.709
Anthony Taylor: I got it. Don't forget. When you run this first cell, it's asking you for a value. 2 values

1115
01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:49.060
Anthony Taylor: got it.

1116
01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:52.750
Anthony Taylor: So it's gonna ask you for 2 things. Okay.

1117
01:40:54.710 --> 01:40:56.869
Anthony Taylor: I remember to push record.

1118
01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:06.189
Anthony Taylor: It is honestly, guys, ultimately, it's my responsibility. But it was funny that

1119
01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:11.030
Anthony Taylor: we all just talked about it that way. We're gonna do that. And then we didn't do it. It's kind of fun.

1120
01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:15.509
Anthony Taylor: So how to go. How'd you guys do going nail-in conditionals

1121
01:41:17.170 --> 01:41:20.629
Anthony Taylor: if you are nailing conditionals. Raise your hand

1122
01:41:21.770 --> 01:41:26.220
Anthony Taylor: if you're not doing so good with conditionals. raise the other one

1123
01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:30.800
Anthony Taylor: all right. Everybody's doing great.

1124
01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:33.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay?

1125
01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:39.360
Anthony Taylor: Let's get through it. So here's all of the stuff we're gonna run that it says

1126
01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:42.450
Anthony Taylor: back to a colonel.

1127
01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:46.379
Anthony Taylor: How many days can you travel? Well.

1128
01:41:47.770 --> 01:41:48.790
Anthony Taylor: 14.

1129
01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:52.070
Anthony Taylor: What city would you like to visit.

1130
01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:54.500
Anthony Taylor: Wow!

1131
01:41:55.220 --> 01:41:58.230
Anthony Taylor: Nobody's asked me that question yet.

1132
01:42:02.050 --> 01:42:03.030
Anthony Taylor: Paris.

1133
01:42:04.810 --> 01:42:05.640
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1134
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.470
Anthony Taylor: alright.

1135
01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:12.110
Anthony Taylor: We ran. That says, if days is digit.

1136
01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:25.110
Anthony Taylor: we're going to put the day's variable in it must have been because it didn't say anything. If type days is int and tight, budget is in. Did you guys get this who got this one anybody.

1137
01:42:26.170 --> 01:42:27.500
Anthony Taylor: This one looks hard.

1138
01:42:28.330 --> 01:42:34.560
Anthony Taylor: Check. If budgets and days are integers. Okay, did everybody know to use type days? And is

1139
01:42:35.610 --> 01:42:40.960
Anthony Taylor: we were just starting on that one we didn't get all the way through it.

1140
01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:46.739
Dipinto, Matt: we use equal equal rather than is. And I take it there, equivalent.

1141
01:42:47.850 --> 01:42:49.330
Anthony Taylor: Yeah, yeah.

1142
01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:54.969
Anthony Taylor: cool. So if you guys get stuck that long on the third cell you could call me.

1143
01:42:56.650 --> 01:43:00.040
Anthony Taylor: we were talking about hairless cats. Yeah.

1144
01:43:00.290 --> 01:43:07.730
Anthony Taylor: we didn't get stuck. We just we just were. That's where we that's as far as we got

1145
01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:15.069
Masarirambi, Rodney: you purposely said you wanted to go to Paris, but it wasn't in the list that was intentional, or

1146
01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:18.810
Anthony Taylor: You'll never know.

1147
01:43:20.850 --> 01:43:22.759
Masarirambi, Rodney: Okay, good for you, sir.

1148
01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:27.069
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Now I have to go redo it.

1149
01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:31.890
Anthony Taylor:  oh, I don't like tomorrow.

1150
01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:37.300
Anthony Taylor: It's not Rome. And for oh, shoot Rome.

1151
01:43:37.510 --> 01:43:38.750
I totally

1152
01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:44.480
Anthony Taylor: one sec. Let's do that again. How many days? 14. Rome arrogant.

1153
01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:47.679
Masarirambi, Rodney: Okay, I say, this week you make the same mistake.

1154
01:43:48.540 --> 01:43:53.019
Anthony Taylor: I like that so daily. So now we're gonna calculate some stuff.

1155
01:43:53.250 --> 01:43:58.509
Anthony Taylor: if daily cost is greater than the daily cost. My daily budget print can't afford it.

1156
01:43:59.570 --> 01:44:03.359
Anthony Taylor: City was not enlist. We cannot make a recommendation.

1157
01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:07.930
Anthony Taylor: Oh, my God, it's freaking case sensitive. Let's fix that

1158
01:44:08.740 --> 01:44:19.110
Anthony Taylor:  city daily cost is Daily Budget Print City to visit if city daily cost. City daily cost daily budget, else Print City was not in list.

1159
01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:21.949
Anthony Taylor: If city visit is in cities.

1160
01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:25.820
Anthony Taylor: so we're going to do cities to visit

1161
01:44:26.410 --> 01:44:27.950
Anthony Taylor: dot lower.

1162
01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:39.329
Anthony Taylor: What did I type the heck? Did I type? How do I know? How would I know when I type

1163
01:44:41.610 --> 01:44:46.700
Anthony Taylor: nice guys. Good work.

1164
01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:52.189
Anthony Taylor: So what was it? Cities? Romeo cities to visit lowercase? Oh.

1165
01:44:52.370 --> 01:44:54.899
oh, oh, oh, I know I didn't.

1166
01:44:57.210 --> 01:45:03.749
Anthony Taylor: So yeah, lower here lowered Rome, which was already lowered. So let's just do lower here

1167
01:45:05.290 --> 01:45:06.470
Anthony Taylor: and now

1168
01:45:07.650 --> 01:45:09.110
Anthony Taylor: we should oh.

1169
01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:16.440
lower!

1170
01:45:18.150 --> 01:45:21.069
Anthony Taylor: You may not let me do it. I might have to do it down in the

1171
01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:25.209
Anthony Taylor: Nope City Index City to visit

1172
01:45:26.730 --> 01:45:32.130
Anthony Taylor: er see, this is such bad. What they did up above is so

1173
01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:34.880
Anthony Taylor: not what you should do.

1174
01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:45.149
Anthony Taylor: Chrome is not in the list. Oh, well, I guess I'm gonna go change Rome for now

1175
01:45:45.220 --> 01:45:50.440
Anthony Taylor: we I could do that. I just gotta figure out what syntax I need to do. So 14

1176
01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:51.540
Anthony Taylor: realm

1177
01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:58.069
Anthony Taylor: and run it and run it and run it and run it.

1178
01:45:58.650 --> 01:46:05.279
Anthony Taylor: Yay. I need $7 and 14 cents more per day.

1179
01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:07.330
Anthony Taylor: Got it.

1180
01:46:08.430 --> 01:46:11.510
Anthony Taylor:  so any questions about all that

1181
01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:22.469
Anthony Taylor: fairly straightforward. So here you've got multiple conditions. You're gonna print based on that being true, else these conditions

1182
01:46:23.330 --> 01:46:26.460
Anthony Taylor: you guys are going to do, if else so much.

1183
01:46:27.090 --> 01:46:31.719
Anthony Taylor: you're going to have it memorized. You're going to say it every I used to do when I was my wife

1184
01:46:31.870 --> 01:46:32.840
Anthony Taylor: right? Right?

1185
01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:44.409
Anthony Taylor: Whatever she is. The lady that used to live here used to be in data, and I had to teach her everything, cause she really didn't know how. I just got her gig as a consultant said, Hey, I

1186
01:46:44.490 --> 01:46:49.359
Anthony Taylor: so when we would drive around, I would say say things like.

1187
01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:54.239
Anthony Taylor: if that car is red, it's true, else

1188
01:46:54.670 --> 01:46:58.189
Anthony Taylor: is it green? No, is it blue? No.

1189
01:46:58.610 --> 01:47:05.519
Anthony Taylor: we would do stuff like that. We would do SQL that way, too, which if you do SQL, it'd be like select cars where car equals red, anyway.

1190
01:47:05.530 --> 01:47:07.000
Anthony Taylor: So we would have fun with that.

1191
01:47:07.230 --> 01:47:09.380
Anthony Taylor: Okay,

1192
01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:14.990
Anthony Taylor: and that's what you guys can start doing. You're gonna think using code.

1193
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:16.890
Anthony Taylor: You're gonna get there. I promise

1194
01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:18.070
you're gonna

1195
01:47:19.150 --> 01:47:25.060
Anthony Taylor: so next, most important thing for Ml and data, science and data engineering.

1196
01:47:25.210 --> 01:47:28.170
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this is a for loop

1197
01:47:28.910 --> 01:47:32.569
Anthony Taylor: for loop is vital to understand.

1198
01:47:33.430 --> 01:47:35.269
Anthony Taylor: You don't need to understand it today.

1199
01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:38.669
Anthony Taylor: but you need to understand it before you leave here.

1200
01:47:40.570 --> 01:47:43.900
Anthony Taylor: What month are y'all leaving here? Holy Cow we got? We started the year

1201
01:47:44.340 --> 01:47:51.260
Anthony Taylor: October. We're gonna leave like in April, holy Moly, we got a long time together. We're gonna get to do Christmas together.

1202
01:47:52.270 --> 01:47:53.260
Anthony Taylor: How fun!

1203
01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:56.699
Anthony Taylor: So for X

1204
01:47:56.770 --> 01:47:59.449
Anthony Taylor: in range 5. So you're learning 4.

1205
01:47:59.690 --> 01:48:07.060
Anthony Taylor: So 4 is, I want you to take every item and assign it to this variable.

1206
01:48:08.570 --> 01:48:15.440
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Well, now, let's see if they do a better one in here. Okay, they do. Okay. I want you to take every item in this output.

1207
01:48:15.690 --> 01:48:23.379
Anthony Taylor: Assign it to this variable. So first, you've never heard of range. So let's do range 5 and see what the heck that is.

1208
01:48:24.460 --> 01:48:25.809
Anthony Taylor: Pick a python phone.

1209
01:48:27.620 --> 01:48:29.460
Anthony Taylor: It says, range 0 5

1210
01:48:29.910 --> 01:48:37.020
Anthony Taylor: alright. And that's what it is, it's basically 0 1, 2, 3, 4.

1211
01:48:38.810 --> 01:48:44.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay, that's what range is. It's a method that returns sequential numbers

1212
01:48:44.030 --> 01:48:53.220
Anthony Taylor: based on. And you can actually tell it to start you. There's other options like, and you'll see that in a minute we'll get there in a second. So this is going to say, for exit range 5

1213
01:48:53.570 --> 01:48:56.820
Anthony Taylor: Prince X. So the first loop

1214
01:48:56.840 --> 01:49:03.159
Anthony Taylor: it's going to be 0. It's going to print 0. Then it's going to print one, and so on, and so on. And it looks like that.

1215
01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:11.640
Anthony Taylor: Okay. we can print this. So if we do a string, multiply it by a number. What happens?

1216
01:49:16.190 --> 01:49:20.610
Anthony Taylor: You get 40 of that string just like that.

1217
01:49:21.100 --> 01:49:34.470
Anthony Taylor: This is because it was in the the pi file before. Right it was they were trying to make it easier to read. Okay, so range in 2 through 7. So this is just like the slice.

1218
01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:37.300
Anthony Taylor: it's gonna start at 2.

1219
01:49:37.770 --> 01:49:41.430
Anthony Taylor: And and before 7,

1220
01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:48.920
Anthony Taylor: okay, so when this prints. we're gonna get 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

1221
01:49:50.730 --> 01:49:56.209
Anthony Taylor: Alright. Now, II would tell you, guys use this kind of stuff like every day every day.

1222
01:49:56.650 --> 01:50:05.320
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we don't really need that, but we'll run it alright. Y equals 2. So yeah.

1223
01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:09.150
sonja baro: the go back up to the the.

1224
01:50:09.270 --> 01:50:14.910
sonja baro: So what made it on that no where you are for x in range, then 2 and 7.

1225
01:50:15.250 --> 01:50:21.369
sonja baro: So Colin is what made it stop at the 6. The one before. Is that right.

1226
01:50:21.940 --> 01:50:31.880
Anthony Taylor: N, not in this case. This is the same column like you had with the if condition, this is saying, this is the end of what I want, because.

1227
01:50:32.050 --> 01:50:35.860
Anthony Taylor: believe it or not, you can fairly elaborate for statements.

1228
01:50:36.490 --> 01:50:44.690
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So the Colon is just indicating that this is all I want you to look at for this for statement. Everything indented

1229
01:50:44.740 --> 01:50:52.410
Anthony Taylor: after this 4 statement I want you to execute. and the cool thing is, and this is why we use it all the time is

1230
01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:57.380
Anthony Taylor: this X value is going to change every loop that it goes through.

1231
01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:03.489
Anthony Taylor: So it's gonna be 6. Then it's gonna be 3. Then it's gonna be 4, then 5, 6.

1232
01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:12.560
sonja baro: So is it because the definition of range is up to the last one, but not including it.

1233
01:51:13.110 --> 01:51:15.999
Anthony Taylor: It is not inclusive of the last value.

1234
01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:17.100
sonja baro: Thank you.

1235
01:51:18.410 --> 01:51:21.540
Anthony Taylor: I love the questions you guys ask really good questions.

1236
01:51:22.470 --> 01:51:24.130
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so

1237
01:51:24.180 --> 01:51:26.880
Anthony Taylor: we're going to loop through ranging numbers 0 through 4.

1238
01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:31.229
Anthony Taylor: Okay, without using the value.

1239
01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:35.140
Anthony Taylor: Now, I don't know why they're showing you this again, who cares?

1240
01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:40.059
Anthony Taylor: Okay, III give this is one of those things where it's really cool to know you can do it.

1241
01:51:40.410 --> 01:51:43.510
Anthony Taylor: I don't understand why they bothered to teach, cause I've never had to do.

1242
01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:45.580
Anthony Taylor: But y equals 2

1243
01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:51.259
Anthony Taylor: for underscore in range 5 is underscore variable? No.

1244
01:51:52.170 --> 01:51:59.640
Anthony Taylor: So that means you don't actually have access to 0 1, 2, 3, 4. However, this loop

1245
01:51:59.900 --> 01:52:01.309
Anthony Taylor: will run

1246
01:52:01.460 --> 01:52:04.970
Anthony Taylor: 0 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 times.

1247
01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:09.179
Anthony Taylor: So in here we can say, y plus equals, 2,

1248
01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:12.200
Anthony Taylor: okay, plus equals

1249
01:52:13.340 --> 01:52:20.040
Anthony Taylor: is the equivalent to y equals y plus 2.

1250
01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:31.689
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it's a shortcut. I thought shortcut. Alright. So anytime you take a variable and do plus equals, and then a value.

1251
01:52:31.740 --> 01:52:36.329
Anthony Taylor: it's going to add that value to the variable and keep it and keep adding.

1252
01:52:37.610 --> 01:52:38.560
Anthony Taylor: okay.

1253
01:52:38.730 --> 01:52:45.289
Anthony Taylor: so the first time it'll be y equal plus equals. 4, then y, 6, 8, 10,

1254
01:52:45.950 --> 01:52:46.750
Anthony Taylor: okay?

1255
01:52:47.220 --> 01:52:51.459
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to print it. So when we run this, we see 4, 6, 8, 1012

1256
01:52:52.470 --> 01:52:55.500
Anthony Taylor: didn't use the X. Now, would it? Yeah, go ahead, Rod.

1257
01:52:56.660 --> 01:53:08.299
Anthony Taylor: does it save the new variable, or does it just, or does it still maintain? Whatever y was that if you run y now at this point

1258
01:53:08.610 --> 01:53:11.679
Anthony Taylor: it is the last value that was assigned to.

1259
01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:15.610
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Now.

1260
01:53:16.220 --> 01:53:17.379
Anthony Taylor: here's the thing.

1261
01:53:17.530 --> 01:53:21.219
Anthony Taylor: then, save anything you could put X here and just not use it.

1262
01:53:22.790 --> 01:53:31.459
Anthony Taylor: Okay, it didn't save them anything. I don't understand why they should set, but where it's okay. It's cool to know if you ever see an underscore. It just means they just wanted to loop.

1263
01:53:31.770 --> 01:53:32.560
Anthony Taylor: that's all.

1264
01:53:32.970 --> 01:53:35.740
Anthony Taylor: And there's other ways to do that which you guys are going to see.

1265
01:53:36.330 --> 01:53:40.449
Anthony Taylor: Okay, now, this is a cool one. So we have the word peace.

1266
01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:42.780
Anthony Taylor: Now

1267
01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:48.429
Anthony Taylor: it. It's obvious that a list or range would be.

1268
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:51.569
Anthony Taylor: It's rubble, new word for some of it

1269
01:53:51.890 --> 01:53:56.849
Anthony Taylor: iterable. It basically means I can cycle through it.

1270
01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:05.000
Anthony Taylor: Okay. a word in python is iterable?

1271
01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:12.540
Anthony Taylor: Which means, if I say, Give me every let I could. By the way, this is just a variable be ball.

1272
01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:18.240
Anthony Taylor: It could be 2. It could be anything.

1273
01:54:18.990 --> 01:54:23.310
Anthony Taylor: Okay. But we're calling it letters so that we understand what we're about to do.

1274
01:54:24.030 --> 01:54:28.610
Anthony Taylor: We're going to say, give me every letter in this word and then print it out one at a time.

1275
01:54:30.620 --> 01:54:31.690
Anthony Taylor: and there you go.

1276
01:54:33.170 --> 01:54:34.020
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1277
01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:38.280
Anthony Taylor: and here's an iterable list.

1278
01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:47.080
Anthony Taylor: I want each item in the lid. This is separated by comma. So I'm going to get cow dog Bebra.

1279
01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:49.859
Anthony Taylor: Okay. Oh, look.

1280
01:54:50.450 --> 01:54:52.749
Anthony Taylor: I uppercase each item

1281
01:54:54.260 --> 01:54:59.590
Anthony Taylor: animal in Zoo upper God, I'd be easy

1282
01:55:04.150 --> 01:55:13.080
Anthony Taylor: for numbers. Now, here's an interesting one. So this is a look like real code. Right here, guys like actual codes, you're gonna use.

1283
01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:17.110
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So you have a list doesn't matter how long it is

1284
01:55:18.070 --> 01:55:20.950
Anthony Taylor: because this will work, even if it's longer or shorter.

1285
01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:28.420
Anthony Taylor: Alright, we have a list, has some data in it. We're gonna say, okay. So for every item in that list.

1286
01:55:28.900 --> 01:55:32.499
Anthony Taylor: Now. without this code right here

1287
01:55:32.810 --> 01:55:40.240
Anthony Taylor: we would have to manually count items. So what this is saying is give me

1288
01:55:40.310 --> 01:55:45.300
Anthony Taylor: the range method that we learned up above. But path in

1289
01:55:45.330 --> 01:55:47.590
Anthony Taylor: the link of our list.

1290
01:55:47.830 --> 01:55:49.630
Anthony Taylor: So this will be range 4.

1291
01:55:51.700 --> 01:56:02.720
Anthony Taylor: Okay. then it's going to. So remember how we slice. How do I get 4? That number 4 out of that list I would do numbers what?

1292
01:56:03.340 --> 01:56:04.600
Gebrekristos, Hafton: Number 3?

1293
01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:14.150
Anthony Taylor: It is? 0 1, 2. But remember, we have to do the index right? So the letter I

1294
01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:16.130
Anthony Taylor: is

1295
01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:18.619
Anthony Taylor: is is that the

1296
01:56:19.010 --> 01:56:23.340
Anthony Taylor: is just 0 1, 2, 3, 4, right? Because we're doing a range.

1297
01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:26.310
Anthony Taylor: So here numbers 0

1298
01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:30.270
Anthony Taylor: 9 plus equals one

1299
01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:32.030
Anthony Taylor: print number 0

1300
01:56:33.700 --> 01:56:46.769
Anthony Taylor: second loop numbers one. which is a sixth plus equal one. So now it's 7 print 7 guests following. The next one is going to be Numbers

1301
01:56:47.010 --> 01:56:49.350
Anthony Taylor: 2, which would be

1302
01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:52.460
Anthony Taylor: 4. That wasn't complicated.

1303
01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:56.780
Anthony Taylor: And then we're going to do Numbers 2, which is 4 plus equals. One is 5.

1304
01:56:58.220 --> 01:57:03.330
Anthony Taylor: Brent. If anyone was listening to this, just those like 3 or 4 set, they would think I'm nuts.

1305
01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:07.459
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so let's run this. See what it looks like. Look at that. 17, 5, 10,

1306
01:57:09.220 --> 01:57:13.040
Anthony Taylor: pretty neat. Now, this would work if I added, you know.

1307
01:57:13.460 --> 01:57:15.220
Anthony Taylor: bunch more numbers.

1308
01:57:18.150 --> 01:57:21.620
Anthony Taylor: Okay, I don't have to change anything it still works.

1309
01:57:23.950 --> 01:57:25.560
Anthony Taylor: You see why this is value.

1310
01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:33.390
Anthony Taylor: You can, by using mostly variables in here we have been able to take any list, and we can add one to it.

1311
01:57:35.470 --> 01:57:36.290
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1312
01:57:37.030 --> 01:57:40.900
Anthony Taylor: alright. Last one. I want you to be careful with this one.

1313
01:57:42.090 --> 01:57:54.580
Anthony Taylor: This is one that can like break your Jupiter notebook or your laptop not break it permanently, like you have to reboot type thing. Alright. So I want to create a variable, important, variable.

1314
01:57:55.630 --> 01:57:59.220
Anthony Taylor: And then I'm gonna say. while

1315
01:58:00.410 --> 01:58:03.060
Anthony Taylor: this variable lower case.

1316
01:58:03.270 --> 01:58:06.180
Anthony Taylor: then have to be lower. But it's not a bad idea

1317
01:58:06.330 --> 01:58:07.609
Anthony Taylor: equals Y.

1318
01:58:09.180 --> 01:58:10.100
Anthony Taylor: Brent.

1319
01:58:13.700 --> 01:58:18.990
Anthony Taylor: Then I'm going to assign to that variable a new value.

1320
01:58:21.380 --> 01:58:22.849
Anthony Taylor: So here's what's going to happen.

1321
01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:27.960
Anthony Taylor: If I type y, it's still equals y. It's gonna print. I again.

1322
01:58:29.710 --> 01:58:40.149
Anthony Taylor: if I type a capital Y because of this lower, it's still y, it's going to run that again. If I type anything else other than

1323
01:58:40.460 --> 01:58:42.920
Anthony Taylor: or what. And stop.

1324
01:58:45.100 --> 01:58:49.340
Anthony Taylor: Okay, this is used a lot well used to be used a lot in video games and stuff.

1325
01:58:49.670 --> 01:59:02.150
Anthony Taylor: You'd be like doing stuff. Something would be happening like the screen and be moving or whatever. And until you do something it doesn't stop right has really old school video games that aged a lot, anyway. So let's run this.

1326
01:59:02.670 --> 01:59:06.850
Anthony Taylor: And it says, Do you want to do it again? And I'm going to say what? Why

1327
01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:14.860
Anthony Taylor: gotta click in there? Why. okay. And I want to put Bob. and and

1328
01:59:15.890 --> 01:59:17.089
Anthony Taylor: it stopped. Okay.

1329
01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:20.340
Anthony Taylor: Whoa! That scared me now, why did he do it one more time.

1330
01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:25.330
Anthony Taylor: or did it? Did he do it one more time.

1331
01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:28.960
Anthony Taylor: No, we couldn't have done it one more time. because it didn't equal Wiagett.

1332
01:59:29.590 --> 01:59:31.150
Anthony Taylor: Okay, so

1333
01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:37.150
Anthony Taylor: there's what. Now, what can go wrong? Let's say you forget to do this.

1334
01:59:39.700 --> 01:59:40.730
Anthony Taylor: what's gonna happen

1335
01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:43.100
Gebrekristos, Hafton: around Florida?

1336
01:59:43.690 --> 01:59:55.180
Anthony Taylor: It will run until you kill it and sometimes killing it involves reboot your computer. Not so much anymore because we can stop the kernel. You can come up here and do restart

1337
01:59:55.750 --> 01:59:57.230
Anthony Taylor: but

1338
01:59:58.670 --> 01:59:59.839
Anthony Taylor: try not to do

1339
02:00:00.270 --> 02:00:04.719
Anthony Taylor: so. Here's one with the Boolean keep looping. It's basically the same thing.

1340
02:00:04.910 --> 02:00:13.730
Anthony Taylor:  input press enter to exit. Oh, yeah, enter to exit and anything else to continue. So all this is looking at

1341
02:00:13.790 --> 02:00:15.810
Anthony Taylor: is, if there's something there.

1342
02:00:17.880 --> 02:00:22.950
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So if we run these 2, if we run this one says, Hi.

1343
02:00:23.030 --> 02:00:25.020
Anthony Taylor: we could say, B,

1344
02:00:25.390 --> 02:00:28.250
Anthony Taylor: answer, and we can put anything in there.

1345
02:00:30.430 --> 02:00:36.310
Anthony Taylor: Okay, except when we press enter by itself. And then it just stops.

1346
02:00:37.930 --> 02:00:42.079
Anthony Taylor: Okay, because there's nothing there which means, now, false.

1347
02:00:43.940 --> 02:00:46.170
Anthony Taylor: alright, pretty exciting.

1348
02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:47.620
Anthony Taylor: What do you guys think of that?

1349
02:00:49.580 --> 02:00:57.909
Anthony Taylor: Alright. So we're gonna do this next one as an everyone do so at least we can get through it, and then we'll just do nested decisions next class.

1350
02:00:57.990 --> 02:01:00.449
Anthony Taylor: and then we'll be caught back up. Okay?

1351
02:01:00.580 --> 02:01:04.120
Anthony Taylor: So actually, this looks like a good one, too.

1352
02:01:05.730 --> 02:01:06.719
Anthony Taylor: Why is it?

1353
02:01:07.210 --> 02:01:08.720
Anthony Taylor: Oh, whoops.

1354
02:01:09.450 --> 02:01:10.650
Anthony Taylor: Don't look at that.

1355
02:01:12.460 --> 02:01:16.690
Anthony Taylor: I'm just kidding. You can look at that cause. We only have 5 min to get through with us. So

1356
02:01:16.970 --> 02:01:23.769
Anthony Taylor:  Sorry I'm hearing something weird in the background.

1357
02:01:24.860 --> 02:01:25.680
Anthony Taylor: Okay.

1358
02:01:27.610 --> 02:01:30.429
Anthony Taylor: alright. So let's do the first one

1359
02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:35.280
Anthony Taylor: all together. Well, first one's variable. So let me select my kernel.

1360
02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:44.280
Anthony Taylor: So it says Loop 3 times through our cities list doesn't say what to do.

1361
02:01:46.300 --> 02:01:52.770
Anthony Taylor: Well, oh, you know what? Okay? So this Jupiter notebook is wrong, anyway. So I'm glad we're doing this together.

1362
02:01:53.050 --> 02:01:55.269
Anthony Taylor: So it wants you to do

1363
02:01:56.730 --> 02:01:57.800
Anthony Taylor: this.

1364
02:02:03.650 --> 02:02:18.509
Anthony Taylor: Okay, alright. So it wants us to do this. So loop times. ask the user for a city and convert it to title case. Append the city to the city's list. Okay? So we have cities there. So let's do it. So we're gonna do 4

1365
02:02:19.340 --> 02:02:23.669
Anthony Taylor: underscore all right in range.

1366
02:02:24.220 --> 02:02:27.419
Anthony Taylor: Let it say 3 times right, Colon.

1367
02:02:27.570 --> 02:02:29.230
Anthony Taylor: Now, we're indented.

1368
02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:37.289
Anthony Taylor: And we're gonna ask for a city. So city equals input  yeah. And we're gonna say.

1369
02:02:37.340 --> 02:02:42.460
Anthony Taylor: what city you want to add.

1370
02:02:43.570 --> 02:02:51.060
Anthony Taylor: okay, and move on from there. And then, whatever they answer, we're gonna append it to the city.

1371
02:02:55.230 --> 02:02:55.910
Oh.

1372
02:02:56.310 --> 02:02:58.869
Anthony Taylor: something's not right. Cities, my bed

1373
02:02:59.230 --> 02:03:00.639
Anthony Taylor: cities that

1374
02:03:02.490 --> 02:03:05.230
Anthony Taylor: by typing this all over the place, there we go.

1375
02:03:05.790 --> 02:03:07.810
Anthony Taylor: See. Okay.

1376
02:03:08.350 --> 02:03:13.289
Anthony Taylor: So when we run this sale. It's going to ask us for 3 cities, Bolivia.

1377
02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:17.980
Anthony Taylor:  Boston.

1378
02:03:20.050 --> 02:03:21.360
Anthony Taylor: Naples!

1379
02:03:22.970 --> 02:03:27.310
Anthony Taylor: Okay. And now we can even look at our variables and see that now

1380
02:03:31.630 --> 02:03:34.680
Anthony Taylor: there it goes. Now it's added those 3 to the list.

1381
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:36.900
Anthony Taylor: Okay. pretty cool.

1382
02:03:37.300 --> 02:03:41.160
Anthony Taylor: We don't need these sales anymore. So we'll just trash these

1383
02:03:42.710 --> 02:03:46.600
Anthony Taylor: alright. Now, it says. use a wild boot

1384
02:03:47.140 --> 02:03:57.559
Anthony Taylor: to append to the city's daily cost list as long as that list is shorter than the city's list. That sounds complicated.

1385
02:03:57.950 --> 02:04:01.589
Anthony Taylor: Alright, then it after that it wants us

1386
02:04:01.900 --> 02:04:03.559
Anthony Taylor: within that wild meat

1387
02:04:05.860 --> 02:04:07.049
Anthony Taylor: to do this

1388
02:04:08.370 --> 02:04:11.450
Anthony Taylor: alright. So first somebody tell me, how would I

1389
02:04:11.900 --> 02:04:14.590
Anthony Taylor: create a loop? That

1390
02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:19.050
Anthony Taylor: would be would run until

1391
02:04:19.610 --> 02:04:25.210
Anthony Taylor: I am no longer, or I am the same link as the as the city's list.

1392
02:04:25.970 --> 02:04:35.750
Anthony Taylor: That's kind of weird. But basically what I need to do is add these costs to that list. But right now, see, they're the same.

1393
02:04:36.190 --> 02:04:41.820
Anthony Taylor: There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, but I added 3.

1394
02:04:43.610 --> 02:04:48.260
Anthony Taylor: So I need to come up with a condition. Anybody want to take a guess at it?

1395
02:04:49.100 --> 02:04:55.189
Anthony Taylor: Good, Matt. I saw that mute. Yeah, while length of city's daily cost.

1396
02:04:57.930 --> 02:05:04.079
Anthony Taylor: I almost III listen. I'm like, he must answer, but no, he just

1397
02:05:04.130 --> 02:05:08.369
Dipinto, Matt: is less than length of cities

1398
02:05:09.010 --> 02:05:20.919
Anthony Taylor: perfect. But you said you never did develop I use python a lot for script. So here. So now we need to get the index.

1399
02:05:21.850 --> 02:05:32.990
Anthony Taylor: So we'll get index length of city's daily cost. So we're getting the link. Use the length of city's daily cost

1400
02:05:33.140 --> 02:05:40.840
Anthony Taylor: for the index of cities to print its value when asking the cost to append to the city's daily costs list. So

1401
02:05:41.190 --> 02:05:51.029
Anthony Taylor: the index is the length which was 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Okay. now, we're gonna say, cost

1402
02:05:51.360 --> 02:05:53.290
Anthony Taylor: equals ends.

1403
02:05:53.540 --> 02:05:58.699
Anthony Taylor: Input. Okay, so we're converting whatever they answer into an integer.

1404
02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:05.859
Anthony Taylor: Sorry I went late. And then we're gonna say.

1405
02:06:06.190 --> 02:06:08.859
Anthony Taylor: my favorite F quote.

1406
02:06:09.010 --> 02:06:11.929
Anthony Taylor: what is the daily cost?

1407
02:06:12.030 --> 02:06:15.540
Anthony Taylor: 4. And now we're gonna print the city

1408
02:06:16.750 --> 02:06:28.579
Anthony Taylor: that we're asking about? So cities bracket index is this totally confusing anybody, this line right here. little bit. So let's talk about

1409
02:06:29.730 --> 02:06:32.460
Anthony Taylor: well, we know what an input is. It's gonna ask us a question.

1410
02:06:32.790 --> 02:06:37.370
Anthony Taylor: Okay, we know what it ends is it's going to convert the answer into an integer.

1411
02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:39.290
Anthony Taylor: Right?

1412
02:06:40.700 --> 02:06:51.789
Anthony Taylor: What is the daily cost for Cities Index. So index right now is the length of city's daily cost. which is 6

1413
02:06:52.320 --> 02:06:56.729
Anthony Taylor: 0 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

1414
02:06:57.670 --> 02:06:59.649
Anthony Taylor: 6 is a new value.

1415
02:07:00.940 --> 02:07:03.659
Anthony Taylor: Correct? It's nothing at this point.

1416
02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:13.930
Anthony Taylor: So this is going to say, what is it? But in the cities, if you remember. we now have 123-45-6789.

1417
02:07:14.940 --> 02:07:22.720
Anthony Taylor: So what we need to do is add a cost. The new cities we just added. So City 6 is going to be.

1418
02:07:22.730 --> 02:07:32.950
Anthony Taylor: Believe that I spoke Olivia wrong. Dang it! So this is going to say, what's the daily cost for the living? Once we get that, we're simply going to add it

1419
02:07:33.780 --> 02:07:36.689
Anthony Taylor: to the city's daily cost list.

1420
02:07:38.180 --> 02:07:41.550
Anthony Taylor: Whatever the answer is. does that make sense?

1421
02:07:42.360 --> 02:07:45.870
Anthony Taylor: More or less? It was, let's let's okay. Now.

1422
02:07:46.150 --> 02:07:48.730
Anthony Taylor: do we need to put an escape variable here.

1423
02:07:51.640 --> 02:07:55.239
Anthony Taylor: What do you guys think? Remember, I told you about wives?

1424
02:07:57.850 --> 02:08:01.610
Anthony Taylor: We don't right, because the length is not going to go forever.

1425
02:08:02.500 --> 02:08:14.020
Anthony Taylor: Eventually the length of this will not be less than the length of this. So let's run this and see what happens. Look at that, Bolivar cost 24 bucks.

1426
02:08:14.700 --> 02:08:18.150
Anthony Taylor: Austin. That place is expensive. 190

1427
02:08:19.730 --> 02:08:23.120
Anthony Taylor: enables even more expensive. 400.

1428
02:08:23.740 --> 02:08:25.660
Anthony Taylor: Okay? Answer.

1429
02:08:25.780 --> 02:08:35.190
Anthony Taylor: And then, now you can see our daily list. Now, has those new values. You see how that works? That's pretty cool. Don't you think

1430
02:08:37.740 --> 02:08:39.960
Anthony Taylor: guys are so like.

1431
02:08:39.980 --> 02:08:43.160
Anthony Taylor: I don't even know what's going on now I give up. Thank you.

1432
02:08:43.530 --> 02:08:45.160
Anthony Taylor: We can hate you, Anthony.

1433
02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:48.210
Anthony Taylor: No. this

1434
02:08:48.500 --> 02:09:03.159
Anthony Taylor: go with okay. next one, for it says, loop through the city's daily cost list and add 10 to each item. So basically, I need to go through the whole city daily cost and add 10,

1435
02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:08.579
Anthony Taylor: we're just gonna do for I range length.

1436
02:09:08.690 --> 02:09:16.069
Anthony Taylor: This is just like in my demo. Okay. so that's going to be east for I and range. We know the length already is 10.

1437
02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:22.149
Anthony Taylor: Was it? 19, 9, and then we're just gonna do cities.

1438
02:09:22.860 --> 02:09:30.230
Anthony Taylor: We're going to refer to its index. With this, I variable and do plus equals. 10,

1439
02:09:31.170 --> 02:09:40.769
Anthony Taylor: right? Okay? And we can see now they all went up to. or whatever that value is. I one more. Then I'm gonna let you guys go. I know I'm late late today. I'm sorry.

1440
02:09:42.180 --> 02:09:48.069
Anthony Taylor: so it says, use a for loop to loop through both the lists at the same time.

1441
02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:58.230
Anthony Taylor: Since there are, there's the same link to print out the city and daily cost on the same line. Now.

1442
02:09:58.630 --> 02:10:03.550
Anthony Taylor: anybody want to take a shot at this. Mike, you are doing a good job staying awake. Thank

1443
02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:07.469
michael mcpherson: I'm dying. Let's

1444
02:10:07.580 --> 02:10:10.149
Anthony Taylor: I know you got one more minute.

1445
02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:19.280
Anthony Taylor: all right, for I in range length cities.

1446
02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:22.989
Anthony Taylor: Okay? So we already know

1447
02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:27.979
Anthony Taylor: we only need one link. They're both the same. We already looked at that.

1448
02:10:28.530 --> 02:10:35.040
Anthony Taylor: So now we can say, print. have quotes the daily cost

1449
02:10:37.390 --> 02:10:41.129
Anthony Taylor: and now we want the city name. So we're gonna do our curly bracket.

1450
02:10:41.290 --> 02:10:51.490
Anthony Taylor: We're going to go to our city's list and grab the I value the index. I okay, come out of our curly brackets and say, is

1451
02:10:52.230 --> 02:10:53.799
Anthony Taylor: dollar sign

1452
02:10:55.170 --> 02:10:56.879
Anthony Taylor: whoops. Put a space in

1453
02:10:57.440 --> 02:10:58.860
Anthony Taylor: curly bracket.

1454
02:10:58.910 --> 02:11:01.369
Anthony Taylor: and we're going to do our cost list

1455
02:11:01.550 --> 02:11:05.990
Anthony Taylor: cities daily costs. I

1456
02:11:08.050 --> 02:11:13.400
Anthony Taylor: not one that would be bad. Okay? And when we run this.

1457
02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:17.180
Anthony Taylor: there you go. So

1458
02:11:17.430 --> 02:11:21.689
Anthony Taylor: let's look at this one more time that I promise and let you guys go. So

1459
02:11:21.890 --> 02:11:24.890
Anthony Taylor: I is just going to increment. Every loop

1460
02:11:24.990 --> 02:11:29.640
Anthony Taylor: range linked cities is going to be whatever the totals are. 1, 2, 3, 9.

1461
02:11:30.130 --> 02:11:43.140
Anthony Taylor: Okay. First, loop daily cost of city. The list. I 0 row row is city daily. Cost 1, 61, 60.

1462
02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:50.630
Anthony Taylor: Okay, next, one's gonna be one Nairobi 80 Nairobi 80.

1463
02:11:51.330 --> 02:11:52.760
Anthony Taylor: Everybody follow

1464
02:11:53.370 --> 02:11:55.549
Anthony Taylor: pretty cool. One more time.

1465
02:11:55.590 --> 02:11:59.979
Anthony Taylor: Phnom Penh is number 2

1466
02:12:00.460 --> 02:12:04.559
Anthony Taylor: and 70 is number 2 in the city's daily list.

1467
02:12:05.580 --> 02:12:08.830
Anthony Taylor: How you guys feel about that Hi, fistify

1468
02:12:09.180 --> 02:12:12.530
Anthony Taylor: conditionals. What do we think?

1469
02:12:13.540 --> 02:12:21.599
Anthony Taylor: 0 1, 2, two's a rough. but I'll make it happen. Rodney. Way thing 0 to 5. What's it? How you feeling right now.

1470
02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:30.369
Anthony Taylor: I'm okay with 2 or 3. It's okay. You guys be honest. It gives me a good cage. Alright good.

1471
02:12:30.380 --> 02:12:39.159
Anthony Taylor: Was a lot of stuff. We, added Jupiter notebooks. Here's the good news guys. Later, you're not gonna have to do that lesson. So we're gonna have more time on a different

1472
02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:43.329
Anthony Taylor:  And we have lots of practice.

1473
