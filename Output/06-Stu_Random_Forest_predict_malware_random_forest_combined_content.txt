# Initial imports
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

## Loading and Preprocessing Malware Apps Data

Load the `app-data.csv` in a pandas DataFrame called `df_apps`

##--CODE--##
# Load data
file_path = "https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m13/lesson_2/datasets/app-data.csv"
df_apps = pd.read_csv(file_path)
df_apps.head()

Define the features set, by copying the `df_apps` DataFrame and dropping the `Result` column.

##--CODE--##
# Define features set
X = df_apps.copy()
X.drop("Result", axis=1, inplace=True)
X.head()

Create the target vector by assigning the values of the `Result` column from the `df_apps` DataFrame.

##--CODE--##
# Define target vector
y = df_apps["Result"].ravel()
y[:5]

Split the data into training and testing sets.

##--CODE--##
# Split into Train and Test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=78)

## Fitting the Random Forest Model

Create a random forest instance and train it with the training data (`X_train` and `y_train`), define `n_estimators=128` and `random_state=78`.

##--CODE--##
# Create the random forest classifier instance


##--CODE--##
# Fit the model


## Making Predictions Using the Random Forest Model

Validate the trained model by malware apps using the testing data (`X_test`).

##--CODE--##
# Make predictions using the testing data


## Model Evaluation

Evaluate model's results, by using `sklearn` to calculate the accuracy score.

##--CODE--##
# Calculate the accuracy score


##--CODE--##
# Display results


## Feature Importance

In this section, you are asked to fetch the features' importance from the random forest model and display the top 10 most important features.

##--CODE--##
# Get the feature importance array

# List the top 10 most important features


## Analysis Questions

Finally, analyze the model's evaluation results and answer the following questions.

* **Question:** Would you trust this model to detect malware? 

    * **Answer:** 

* **Question:** Out of the following models, which one had the highest accuracy score: logistic regression, SVM, KNN, decision tree, or random forest?

    * **Answer:**
