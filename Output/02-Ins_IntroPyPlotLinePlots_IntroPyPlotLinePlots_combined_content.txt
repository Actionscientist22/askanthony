# Introduction to PyPlot

##--CODE--##
# Import Numpy for calculations and matplotlib for charting
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

## Plotting an Exponential Series

##--CODE--##
# Creates a numpy array from 0 to 5 with each step being 0.1 higher than the last


##--CODE--##
# Creates an exponential series of values which we can then chart


##--CODE--##
# Create a graph based upon the list and array we have created

# Show the graph that we have created


##--CODE--##
# Give our graph axis labels


# Have to plot our chart once again as it doesn't stick after being shown


## Plotting Trigonometric Data

##--CODE--##
# Create our x_axis numpy array


##--CODE--##
# Creates a numpy array based on the sin of our x_axis values


##--CODE--##
# Creates a numpy array based on the cos of our x_axis values


##--CODE--##
# Plot both of these lines so that they will appear on our final chart
