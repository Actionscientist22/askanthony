import pandas as pd

# Import the data
file = '../Resources/donors2021.csv'
donors_df = pd.read_csv(file)
donors_df.head()

##--CODE--##
# If 10% of every donation was fully matched by an 
# anonymous philanthropist, making a new column would be easy.
donors_df['Match Amount'] = donors_df['Amount'] * 0.1
donors_df.head()


##--CODE--##
# What if the match percentage changed based on the amount donated?
# 10% on donations below $500, and 20% on donations of $500 or more.
# We need a new solution! A perfect opportunity for 'apply'.

# Define a function

# "Apply" the function to the amount column


##--CODE--##
# Apply can also use values from multiple columns by
# setting the axis argument to 1. Suppose the donor 
# was only matching donations from Delaware.

# Define the function

# "Apply" the function to the DataFrame


##--CODE--##
# Finally, apply can also be used with lambda functions.
