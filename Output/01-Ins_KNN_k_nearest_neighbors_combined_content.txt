# Dataset:  glass.csv

Source: Vina Spiehler, Ph.D., DABFT Diagnostic Products Corporation

Description: Research conducted to test the rule-based system BEAGLE to determine whether a glass was a type of "float" glass or not. 6 types of glass are defined in terms of their oxide content. The study of classification of types of glass was motivated by criminological investigation. At the scene of the crime, the glass left can be used as evidence, but only if it is correctly identified!
