## Background: Major US Federal Laws and Regulations

The following is a list of major federal rules in the US. **Federal** means that these rules apply to anyone working in the US, regardless of the state. This is important because states often have their own rules. We'll get to some of those later.

### Federal Trade Commission (FTC)

The [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/) is a government agency for protecting consumers, or people who buy goods and services, in the US. The FTC was one of the first government agencies to start policing how companies use customer data. It has the power to investigate companies who have practices that deceive consumers. For more information, refer to [A Brief Overview of the Federal Trade Commission's Investigative, Law Enforcement, and Rulemaking Authority](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/what-we-do/enforcement-authority).

In the 1970s, the FTC began to consider data security and data-privacy violations as deceptive commercial practices. For example, if a company says to its customers that it won’t sell their information but does so anyway, the FTC will consider that a deceptive practice. Note that the primary concern of the FTC is the honesty of companies with their customers. So, if a company says to its customers, “We plan to sell your information to anyone who’s interested in buying it,” and it does so, the FTC will most likely find that acceptable.

To learn more about the history of the FTC enforcing data security and data privacy, refer to [Privacy and Security Enforcement](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/media-resources/protecting-consumer-privacy/privacy-security-enforcement) on the official FTC website.

### Finance

The FTC enforces two major rules that impact the handling of financial data. The first is the **Gramm-Leach-Bliley-Act of 1999 (GLBA)**, which is also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999. This rule tells financial institutions how they can collect and share the personal financial information of their customers. It also requires financial institutions to protect financial data from malicious hackers and other types of data breaches. Finally, it tries to prevent people and companies from accessing financial information under false pretenses, which is called **pretexting**.

To read a summary of the GLBA, which includes links to the full text of the rule, refer to the [Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/statutes/gramm-leach-bliley-act) on the official FTC website.

The second major rule that impacts financial institutions is the **Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 (FCRA)**. This rule primarily impacts agencies that collect information about consumers, such as credit bureaus, medical information companies, and businesses that screen tenants for landlords. The FCRA controls how these agencies can share the information that they collect about consumers&mdash;by specifying the conditions under which people and companies can request access. It also requires that agencies investigate any complaints that consumers make about the accuracy of a report. Furthermore, it requires that agencies let consumers know if any adverse actions, such as a denial of credit, are taken based on a report.

To read a summary of the FCRA, which includes links to the full text of the rule, refer to [Fair Credit Reporting Act](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/statutes/fair-credit-reporting-act) on the official FTC website.

### Children

The FTC enforces a rule to protect information about children, called the **Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA)**. This rule gives parents the right to control the information that’s collected from children online. Companies that either have services directed at children under 13 or collect information about children under 13 must do the following:

* Notify the parents of those children about the information that they’re collecting.

* Obtain parental permission to collect, use, or share their children's data.

* Give parents access to their children's data.

* Limit the information that they collect about children to the minimum that’s needed for participation in the activity.

* Set up security safeguards to prevent the unauthorized sharing of children's information.

To read a summary of COPPA, which includes a link to the full text of the rule, refer to [Children's Online Privacy Protection Act](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/statutes/childrens-online-privacy-protection-act) on the official FTC website.

### Healthcare

**The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)** includes the **HIPAA Privacy Rule**. This rule dictates how protected health information should and should not be handled. **protected health information**, or **PHI**, refers to any information that can be used to identify a person, and information that a health or medical organization (or any of its associates) holds or transmits. Organizations can use this information to treat patients and obtain payment without a patient's written consent. However, all other uses of PHI require written consent from the patient. This rule also gives patients the right to correct any inaccurate PHI, and it requires organizations to notify patients about how their information is being used.

To read a summary of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which includes links to the full text of the rule, refer to [The HIPAA Privacy Rule](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/index.html) on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services website.

### Education

The **Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974** protects the privacy of student education records. **Education records** refer to the records that a school maintains. FERPA allows parents, guardians, and students to access and review. They also have the right to correct any inaccuracies that they find in those records. In most cases, FERPA requires schools to have written consent from a parent or student to share information from the student’s education record. However, the rule lays out some exceptions. For example, schools can share student education records with officials who are auditing the school&mdash;without explicit consent. Schools can also share these records with financial aid organizations. Finally, schools can share **directory information**, such as students’ names, addresses, and telephone numbers.

To read a summary of FERPA, refer to [Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html) on the U.S. Department of Education website. For the full text of the rule, refer to [FERPA | Protecting Student Privacy](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/node/548/).

### Communications

The **Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA)** protects the privacy of certain types of communications that are made on computers. This rule has some specific provisions. The **Wiretap Act** prevents electronic communications from being intercepted.  The **Stored Communications Act (SCA)** specifies how service providers, such as internet and telephone companies, can store and share information about their subscribers. The ECPA also requires the government to have a court order before installing communication surveillance devices.

To read a summary of the ECPA, which includes a link to the full text of the rule, refer to [Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA)](https://bja.ojp.gov/program/it/privacy-civil-liberties/authorities/statutes/1285) on the Bureau of Justice Assistance website.
