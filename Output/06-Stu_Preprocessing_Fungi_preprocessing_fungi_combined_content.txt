# Check the size of the second image


##--CODE--##
# Get all the sizes into a list, then convert to a set

# View the set of sizes


##--CODE--##
# Convert the images to the middle 250, 250 size
# Lets try with the first image



##--CODE--##
# Using the same syntax, use a for loop to apply resizing to all images


##--CODE--##
# Lets examine our data numerically.
# This is most easily done by converting the image to a numpy array

# Convert one image to a NumPy array


# Display the pixel values


##--CODE--##
# Convert all images to floating point numpy arrays

# Display the pixel values of the first image


##--CODE--##
# To normalize pixel values to a range between 0 and 1,
# we need to divide all pixel values by the max of 255


# Display the pixel values of the first image
