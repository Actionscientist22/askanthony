# Declare lists
cities = ["Rome", "Nairobi", "Phnom Penh", "Santiago", "Toronto", "Rotorua"]
cities_daily_cost = [150, 70, 60, 80, 110, 125]

# Loop 3 times through the cities list

# Ask the user for a city and convert it to title case

# Append the city to the cities list


# Use a while loop to append to the cities_daily_cost list as long as that list
# is shorter than the cities list

# Use the length of cities_daily_cost for the index of cities to print its
# value when asking the cost to append to the cities_daily_cost list


# Loop through the cities_daily_cost list and add 10 to each item


# Use a for loop to loop through both of the lists at the same time, since
# they're the same length, and print out the city and daily cost on the same
# line
