# Create a reference the CSV file desired

##--CODE--##
# Check the names of all the columns and see if there are any rows with missing data


##--CODE--##
# Rename mistyped columns "Aid Given or Received Code " and "Propery Loss"


##--CODE--##
# Reduce to columns: Reporting Year, Fire Department Name, Incident date, Incident Type,
# Aid Given or Received Code, Aid Given or Received, Number of Alarms, Alarm Date and Time,
# Arrival Date and Time, Last Unit Cleared Date and Time, Actions Taken 1, Actions Taken 2,
# Actions Taken 3, Property Value, Property Loss, Contents Value, Contents Loss,
# Fire Service Deaths, Fire Service Injuries, Other Fire Deaths, Other Fire Injuries,
# Property Use, Incident Street Address, Incident Apartment Number, Incident City, Incident Zip Code



##--CODE--##
# Fill NAs for columns "Actions Taken 1", "Actions Taken 2", "Actions Taken 3", 
# and "Incident Apartment Number" with ''
# Fill NAs for columns "Other Fire Deaths", "Other Fire Injuries",
# "Property Loss", and "Contents Loss" with 0


##--CODE--##
# Remove remaining rows with missing data


##--CODE--##
# Filter data to incidents that caused Property or Contents Loss


##--CODE--##
# Count how many incidents occured in each city


##--CODE--##
# Convert the city_counts Series into a DataFrame


##--CODE--##
# Convert the column name into "Sum of Loss Incidents"


##--CODE--##
# Calculate the number of deaths from fire incidents where loss occurred


##--CODE--##
# Want to calculate the fire department response time? There is a problem
# Problem can be seen by examining datatypes within the DataFrame


##--CODE--##
# Convert relevant date columns to datetime


##--CODE--##
# Now it is possible to find the response time in seconds
# Hint: create a new column for "Response Time (seconds)" and use .dt.total_seconds()
# to calculate the seconds


##--CODE--##
# Check data for columns of your choosing
