# Quotation mark issues
# Double quotes (") and single quotes (') can be used interchangeably but the
# same type of quotation mark must be used to open and close the string.
# It is best practice to remain consistent with your use of quotation marks.
# If a string needs to include one type of quotation mark, you can use the
# other kind to open and close the string.

# What if you want to use both types of quotation marks in your string?
# Then you can use the backslash (\) escape character. This tells Python to
# treat the following character differently than it ordinarily would.

# You can also use triple quotes to print over multiple lines

# Often, we don't want to use triple quotes to store text across multiple
# lines, as the text can't be indented when we get to complex decisions.
# In those situations, we can insert a new line character instead.

# Print a new line character: \n

# Ask the user for an input string and concatenate it with a new line

# Print formatting options:

# f-strings

# Repeating strings

# Lowercase strings

# Uppercase strings

# Title case strings

# Multiline f-strings

# Format floating point values

# Add a thousands comma to a number

# Create a string of 50 dashes

# Long text as an f-string
