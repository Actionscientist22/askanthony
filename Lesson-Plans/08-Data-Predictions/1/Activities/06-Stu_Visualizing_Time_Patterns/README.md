# Analyzing Time Series Patterns in the S&P 500 Index

In this activity, you’ll gain additional practice working with the hvPlot grouped plots.

## Instructions

Using the starter code provided, complete the following steps:

1. Read the S&P 500 volume data into a DataFrame. (Be sure to declare the `datetime` index.)

2. Slice the DataFrame so that it only includes the volume data.

3. Plot the volume data according to the day of the week. On what day does trading in the S&P 500 tend to be the most active?

4. Visualize the hourly trends for each day of the week. Does any day-of-week pattern concentrate in just a few hours of a particular day?

5. Create a plot that shows the data grouped by the calendar week in the year (week of year). Does the share-trading intensity tend to increase at any particular part of the calendar year?
