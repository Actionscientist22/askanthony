# Visualizing Stock Data

In this activity, you will explore your time series dataset by creating visualizations of the data.

## Background

As you analyze Tesla Inc.'s stock data, you'll investigate how TSLA performs in the US stock market across various dates and times. You resolve to use your slicing and data visualization skills to create a report to share with your team and receive feedback.

## Instructions

For this activity, you’ll use the Tesla stock data from an earlier activity. The first part of the starter Jupyter notebook recalls preparing the data and setting the time zone. Review the initial section, and then continue with the following steps:

1. Set the “time” column as the DataFrame index.

2. Plot the closing prices of the TSLA stock.

3. Using the `loc` function, zoom in to 2020 to inspect the TSLA closing prices.

4. Using the `loc` function in conjunction with `DatetimeIndex` attributes, plot the TSLA closing prices.

5. Using the `loc` function, plot the closing prices between August and September 2020.

6. Using the `loc` function, plot the closing prices between August 22 and September 5, 2020.
