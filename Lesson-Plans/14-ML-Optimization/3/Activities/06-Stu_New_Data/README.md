# Bank Marketing: Fourth Model With New Data

In this activity, use your model to make predictions on new data.

## Instructions

1. Import the data from this link into a DataFrame.

2. Create X and y variables. Do NOT train&ndash;test split!

3. Preprocess the X and y variables using the same steps you used to train your model.

4. Make predictions on the preprocessed X data using your model.

5. Check the balanced accuracy score of the predictions and consider the following questions:

* Are these better or worse than you expected?

* How  difficult was it to preprocess and make predictions on new data?

* Could you improve your preprocessing pipeline at all to make it easier?
