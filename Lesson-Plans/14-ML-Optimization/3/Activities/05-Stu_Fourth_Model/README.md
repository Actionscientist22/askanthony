# Bank Marketing: Fourth Model

In this activity, use all the skills you've learned to create the best model you can.

## Instructions

Feel free to use any techniques to improve your score and to prevent overfitting! Note that the solution file focuses on refactoring code to be more streamlined, including moving many of the preprocessing functions to a `.py` file and then importing them into the main notebook. Feel free to read through the solution, but know that your code can and should look completely different.
