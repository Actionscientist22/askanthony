# Third Model

## Introduction

Use your newfound preprocessing skills to try to improve our bank marketing model.

## Instructions

For this activity, feel free to start with the unsolved Jupyter notebook **OR** use your own notebook from the previous class. Use whatever methods you see fit to attempt to improve the model, including filling missing values, encoding text data, model selection, etc. As you work, remember to avoid overfitting and check the performance of your model using the balanced accuracy metric! If you get stuck and don't know what steps to take next, consult freely with your classmates and instructional team. Building a machine learning model should not be a solo adventure!
