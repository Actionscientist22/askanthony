# Choosing Encodings

## Introduction

In this activity you will examine and preprocess a dataset with categorical features.

## Instructions

Open the Jupyter notebook in the `Unsolved` folder and repeat the following steps for each column in the dataset:

1. Use the provided code to import and split the data.

2. Display the value_counts of the column. What encoder would be best?

3. Create and train an encoder for the column using the training data.

After creating and training encoders for every column using the training data, proceed to the following steps:

1. Create a function to preprocess X data. Use the trained encoders and return the preprocessed DataFrame.

2. Preprocess the training data.

3. Preprocess the testing data.
