# Overfitting

## Introduction

In this activity you will split the data into training and testing sets to identify overfitting. Then, you will use hyperparameter variation on max_depth to determine the optimal value to balance underfitting and overfitting. While completing this activity, consider other hyperparameters we could modify to improve the fit of the model.

## Instructions

Use the Jupyter notebook in the `Unsolved` folder to complete the following steps:

1. Import the data.

2. Create an X variable and a y variable.

3. Split the data into training and testing sets.

4. Create a Random Forest model.

5. Fit the model to the training data.

6. Calculate the accuracy of the model on the testing data.

7. Calculate the accuracy of the model on the training data. Is the model overfit?

8. Create a loop to vary the max_depth parameter. Make sure to record the depth, train score, and test score for each pass.

9. Create a DataFrame from the scores, setting the index to the depth.

10. Plot the DataFrame. Where do the train and test scores diverge? What value of max_depth best balances overfitting and underfitting?
