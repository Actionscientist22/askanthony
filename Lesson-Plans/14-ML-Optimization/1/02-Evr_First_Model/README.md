# First Model

## Introduction

Using the bank marketing data, you'll create a basic logistic regression model for classification. This model will be created quickly, and many best practices will be skipped or ignored altogether. Throughout the activity, think about how the data, the model, and the analysis as a whole might be improved.

## Instructions

Use the Jupyter notebook in the `Unsolved` folder to complete the following steps:

1. Import the data.

2. Drop rows with null values.

3. Convert the y column to numeric using the get_dummies function.

4. Verify changes with the info method.

5. Set up X and y variables.

6. Create and train a logistic regression model.

7. Print the score from the model.
