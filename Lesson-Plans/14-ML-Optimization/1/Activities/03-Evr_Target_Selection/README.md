# Target Selection

## Instructions

This activity will introduce three hypothetical datasets. As a class, you should discuss each target column choice, along with any implications that may come with choosing each target column.

1. You are given a medical dataset with hospital intake information on thousands of patients. The hospital staff would like to use ML to help them make better decisions about which patients should be prescribed antibiotics. The choices for target columns are:

    a. A binary column that indicates whether or not the patient was diagnosed with an infection

    b. A binary column that indicates whether or not the patient responded well to antibiotics while in the hospital

    c. A column that indicates the patient's self-reported health 30 days after antibiotic treatment on a 1&ndash;10 scale.

2. You are given a stock market dataset with data on every trade a particular company has made in the previous five years. The company would like to use ML to predict whether a trade will be profitable or not. The choices for target columns are:

    a. A column that gives the total profit (or loss) from each trade

    b. A column that gives the percentage profit (or loss) from each trade

    c. A binary column that indicates whether or not a trade made at least 10% profit

3. You are given a dataset with earthquake records from the past 50 years. The United States Geological Survey would like to use ML to better predict aftershock impacts after an earthquake. The choices for target columns are:

    a. A column indicating whether or not there was an aftershock after each earthquake

    b. A column with the total economic impact in dollars from the aftershocks after each earthquake

    c. A column indicating the number of lives lost in aftershocks after each earthquake
