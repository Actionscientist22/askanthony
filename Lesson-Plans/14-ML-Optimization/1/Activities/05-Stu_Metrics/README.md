# Metrics

## Introduction

In this activity you will apply several metrics to a logistic regression model trained to predict whether crowdfunding projects will reach their goal. Be prepared to discuss the implications of each metric after completing the activity.

## Instructions

Use the Jupyter notebook in the `Unsolved` folder to complete the following steps:

1. Import the data.

2. Show the total number of positive and negative outcomes.

3. Create an X variable and a y variable.

4. Create a logistic regression model.

5. Fit the model to the training data.

6. Make predictions on the test data.

7. Create a confusion matrix.

8. Create a classification report.

9. Calculate the balanced accuracy score.

10. Predict values with probabilities.

11. Print the probabilities.

12. Each prediction includes a prediction for both the 0 class and the 1 class. We only need the predictions for the 1 class, so use a list comprehension to gather the second value from each list.

13. Print the first 5 probabilities.

14. Calculate the roc_auc_score.
