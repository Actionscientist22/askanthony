# Apply Taxes

In this activity, you will take a DataFrame containing utility usage data and calculate tax rates for each row using progressively more difficult rules.

## Instructions

Using the DataFrame provided, perform all of the following actions:

* Use the apply function to create the Tax Rate column assuming that every year and type of utility had a tax rate of 5%, except for 2019 when the tax was raised to 5.5%.

* Recalculate the tax rate assuming that commission-owned units were taxed an additional 1% on electricity.

* Use apply with a lambda function to set the existing Tax Rate column to 0 if the utility was Passengers.
