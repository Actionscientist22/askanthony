# Answering Abstract Questions

In this activity, you are tasked with answering one question given the data on utility consumption from SFO airport. The question is as follows: which utility's usage changed the most from 2013 to 2019?

## Instructions

Work together and use the data analysis process to answer the question.

* There are two files in the Unsolved folder, a blank file and a starter file. The starter file will walk you through a prescribed solution step by step, while the blank file gives you no instructions.

* It is recommended to try and work on this using the blank file. Know that there are many different solutions to this question and equally as many ways to code each solution. If your work doesn't match that of your instructor or your classmates, you may have found another way to solve the same problem!

* If you struggle to make progress on your own, pay attention to your instructor's code and focus on understanding why it was written, then go back to the blank file later to attempt to repeat the solution on your own.

## Hint

* Use the Pandas documentation [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/frame.html) to find functions if you need them!
