# Pandas Recap and Data Types

In this activity, we will recap what we have learned about Pandas up to this point.

## Instructions

* Open ‘PandasRecap.ipynb’ under the ‘unsolved’ folder in your Jupyter notebook.

* Go through the cells, and follow the instructions in the comments.

## Hints

* A list of a DataFrame's data types can be checked by accessing its `dtypes` property.

* To change a non-numeric column to a numeric column, use the `df.astype(<datatype>)` method and pass in the desired data type as the parameter.
