# Summary Statistics in Python

In this activity, you will calculate a number of summary statistics for two different datasets. The first dataset is from an in-office survey of how much coffee each employee drinks every day. The second dataset is a subset of the California housing dataset available from the scikit-learn library.

## Instructions

1. Calculate the mean, median, and mode for cups of coffee consumed daily.

2. Create a histogram of cups of coffee consumed daily.

3. Use Pandas to import the `California_Housing.csv` from the Resources folder.

4. Determine and calculate the most appropriate measure of central tendency to describe the Population column.

5. Inspect the average occupancy of housing in California and determine whether there are any potential outliers in the dataset.

   * **Hint**: This dataset is very large; a visual test will not suffice.

6. If there are outliers, create a new DataFrame by filtering the original DataFrame to show only the outliers.

7. Find the minimum and maximum median-income values across all the outlier data points.
