# Calculate the budget remaining after flights and accommodation

# Calculate the remaining budget in local currency amount

# Calculate the budget per day in the local currency

# Calculate the budget per day in the local currency, ignoring cents

# Calculate the total area around the hotel the user can walk within
# Area of a circle = pi * radius ** 2
# pi = 3.14159265358979323846

# Calculate the amount left from the budget if the user sticks with their
# daily budget. This is a modulus problem.
