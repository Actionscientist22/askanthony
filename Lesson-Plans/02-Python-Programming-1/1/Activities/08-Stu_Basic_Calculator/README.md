# Vacation Calculator

## Introduction

In this activity, you will use calculation operators to help a user plan their vacation.

## Instructions

The starter code provided includes input questions for the user. Use the variables created from these inputs to perform the following calculations and print out the results:

* The budget remaining after flights and accommodation

* The remaining budget in local currency amount

* The remaining budget per day in the local currency

* The remaining budget per day in the local currency, ignoring cents (floor division)

* The total area around the hotel the user can walk within

  > **Note:**
  >
  > Area of a circle = pi * radius to the power of 2
  >
  > pi = 3.14159265358979323846

* The amount left from the budget if the user sticks with their daily budget. This is a modulus problem.
