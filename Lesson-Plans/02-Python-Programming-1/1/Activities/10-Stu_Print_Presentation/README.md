# Print Presentation

## Introduction

In this activity, you will practice printing more complex strings, along with reinforcing other Python skills from this class.

## Instructions

Write code that completes the following tasks:

* Print a string that uses the new line character.

* Ask the user for a name and store it as a variable.

* Use an f-string to print the name in title case, along with something they said that uses both single and double quotation marks.

* Ask the user for the number of dashes that should be displayed in the presentation and convert it to an integer.

* Ask the user for the radius of a circle and convert it to a float.

* Print out the dashes the user requested.

* Use a multiline f-string to print out the radius, surface area, and volume of a sphere to 4 decimal places using the radius from the user input.

  > **Note:**
  >
  > pi = 3.14159265358979323846
  >
  > Surface area of a sphere = 4 * pi * radius to the power of 2
  >
  > Volume of a sphere = 4/3 * pi * radius to the power of 3
