# Laundry Pseudocode Solution

```python
# Algorithm: Sorting Laundry

# Tasks:
# Sort delicate clothes
# Sort white clothes
# Sort red clothes
# Sort remaining clothing
# Wash clothes in washing machine

# Pattern recognition:
# Delicate clothes go into basket 1
# White clothes go into basket 2
# Red clothes go into basket 3
# Remaining clothes go into basket 4

# Abstraction:
# Ignore bedding
# Ignore towels

# Sequence:
# 1. Event 1: Sort clothes:
#    Conditional: If (item is delicate) 
#                    place it in basket 1
#                 Else if (item is white)
#                    place it in basket 2
#                 Else if (item is red) 
#                    place it in basket 3
#                 Else
#                    place it in basket 4
# 2. Event 2: Wash laundry:
#    Loop: for (each basket of laundry):
#        Sequence:
#        a. Put basket of laundry in the washing machine
#        b. Add laundry soap to the washing machine
#        c. Apply settings on washing machine:
#           Conditional: If (basket 1)
#                           use delicates setting on machine
#                        Else
#                           use regular settings
#        d. Turn machine on and wait until done
#        e. Remove clothes from washing machine and return to basket
