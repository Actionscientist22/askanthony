# Pseudocoding Practice

## Introduction

In this activity, you will practice writing pseudocode for the scenario of sorting and washing laundry.

## Instructions

Your pseudocode template should include:

* Tasks

* Pattern recognition

* Abstraction

* Sequence

Write pseudocode for washing laundry with the following conditions:

* Laundry should be sorted into four baskets: white clothes, red clothes, delicates, and everything else. You should consider the order in which to sort these items..

* Include abstractions. Laundry may be mixed with bedding and towels, but we're not interested in sorting this type of laundry.

* Each basket of laundry should go through the washing machine and follow a specific sequence of steps:

    * Put the basket of clothes in the machine.

    * Add laundry soap to the machine.

    * Apply the machine settings.

    * Turn the machine on and wait until it's done.

    * Remove the laundry and return it to the basket.

* Only the delicates basket has special settings on the washing machine and requires a conditional check to ensure the appropriate settings are used.
