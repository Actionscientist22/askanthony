# Input Order

## Introduction

In this activity, you will practice saving inputs from the command line as variables, using string concatenation, and converting data types.

## Instructions

* Create a variable that takes in the name of an item the user wants to purchase.

* Use the item variable to ask the user how much the item costs and how many they want:
  * Convert the item cost and quantity to numbers. Consider which type of number type is best for each variable: float or integer?
  * Save the converted inputs as two new variables.

* Print out the values of each of these two new variables, along with their data types, to confirm they were correctly converted.

* Finally, display a sentence that includes all three variables.

## Hints

Consider using pseudocode to help plan out your code.
