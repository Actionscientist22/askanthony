# Hello, Variable World

## Introduction

In this activity, you will create a simple Python application that uses variables and prints strings out to the console.

## Instructions

* Create two variables, called `full_name` and `country_to_visit`, that will hold strings.

* Create one variable called `days` that will hold an integer.

* Create one variable called `exchange_rate` that will hold a float.

* Create a variable called `satisfied` that will hold a Boolean.

* Print out a sentence for each of the variables: `full_name`, `country_to_visit`, `days`, `exchange_rate`, and `satisfied`. Make sure the variables are printed out on the same line as the rest of the sentence.
