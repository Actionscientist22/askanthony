# Exploring the Nest

## Introduction

In this activity, you'll practice accessing information from nested data structures containing information about birds.

## Instructions

You have been provided with a list of lists and a list of dictionaries, both containing the same information about birds: name, size (cm), weight (g), and lifespan.

Using these data structures, perform the following actions:

* Use a loop to print out the data about the fourth bird in `birds_list`.

* Calculate the total weight (kg) of all the birds in the `birds_list` and print the result to three decimal places.

* Use a loop to print the names of the birds and their lifespans from the `birds_dictionaries`, along with their size to weight ratio.

* Answer the question: Which bird has the highest size to weight ratio (lightest weight for its size)? Which has the lowest?
