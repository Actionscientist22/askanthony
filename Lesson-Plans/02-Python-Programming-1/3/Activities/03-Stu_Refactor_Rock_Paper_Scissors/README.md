# Refactor Rock Paper Scissors

## Introduction

Refactoring code is when we make changes to the code in order to reduce the complexity, or improve the performance or readability, without changing the functionality of the program.

In this activity, you will convert the rock, paper, scissors code from if-else statements to match case statements.

## Instructions

* Open the provided starter code. You will notice that it is the same as the solution from our warm up activity, with two of our if-else statements removed.

* Under the associated code comment, create a variable called `user_full_choice` to hold the text of the full word for the user's choice by using a match case statement.

* You will notice that we have kept the if-else statement that checks if there is a tie. Inside the `else` clause, after printing the user's choice, write a nested match case statement that does the following:

    ```text
    # Check the user's choice
        # Check the computer's choice
            # Print the computer's choice
            # Print the result
    ```

## Hints

* Apply what you learned about nested if-else statements to nested match case statements.

**Remember:** It's always okay to ask for help if you get stuck.
