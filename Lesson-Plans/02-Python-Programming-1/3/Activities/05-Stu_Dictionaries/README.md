# Understanding Dictionaries

## Introduction

In this activity, you will create and access a dictionary that is based on you and your own hobbies.

## Instructions

1. Create a dictionary to store the following information:

    * Your name with the key `name`
    * Your age with the key `age`
    * A list with the key `hobbies` that lists a few of your hobbies
    * A dictionary with the key `wake-up` that includes a few days and the time you typically wake up on those days, with the key-value pair being in the format `"day": "time"`.

2. Print out sentences that use the following information from the dictionary:

    * Your name and age
    * The first hobby in your hobby list
    * A time you typically wake up during the week

3. Loop through the dictionary using the `items()` method to print out the key-value pairs.
