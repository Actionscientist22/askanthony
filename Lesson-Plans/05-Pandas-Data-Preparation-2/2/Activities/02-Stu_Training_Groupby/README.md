# Training Grounds

In this activity, you will work in pairs to use the `groupby()` function to calculate the average weight and membership length of gym members per trainer.

## Instructions

1. Using the athletic training data, create a DataFrame.

2. Convert the "Membership (Days)" column into weeks and add this new series into the DataFrame.

3. Create a DataFrame containing only the "Trainer", "Weight", and membership length in days and weeks.

4. Group the data by trainer and show the average weight and membership length  of the gym members for each.

5. Sort the grouped data by "Membership (Days)" in descending order.
