# Binning Movies

In this activity, you will test your binning skills by creating bins for movies based on their IMDb user vote count.

## Instructions

* Read in the CSV file provided, and print it to the screen.

* Find the minimum "IMDB user vote count" and maximum "IMDB user vote count".

* Using the minimum and maximum "votes" as a reference, create nine bins to slice the data into.

* Create a new column called "IMDB User Votes Group", and fill it with the values collected through your slicing.

* Group the DataFrame based on the values within "IMDB User Votes Group" and find out if there is an equal distribution of rows that fall into each bin.

* Show the average of each of the first five ratings for the following columns: "RottenTomatoes", "RottenTomatoes_User", "Metacritic", "Metacritic_User", and "IMDB", and round the averages to one decimal place.
