# Multi-indexing Pivoting Car Sales

In this activity, you will practice reshaping data on multiple indices and gain insights on car sales using aggregations.

## Instructions

1. Read the `vehicles.csv` file into a DataFrame named `vehicles_df`.

2. Reshape the `vehicles_df` DataFrame to show the number of vehicles for each model and make, then, rename the "count" column "Total", and sort the pivot table on the "Total" column to show the top 20 vehicles sold by model and make.

3. Reshape the `vehicles_df` DataFrame to show the number of vehicles for each model, make, and year, then rename the "count" column "Total", and sort the pivot table on the "year" index and "Total" column and show the top 20 vehicles sold by the year.

4. Reshape the `vehicles_df` DataFrame to show the total number of vehicles for each category and year, then rename the "count" column "Total", and sort the pivot table on the "Total" column to show the top 20 vehicles sold by category and year.

5. Reshape the `vehicles_df` DataFrame to show the total number vehicles for each category, model, and year, then rename the "count" column "Total", and sort the pivot table on the "Total" column to show the top 20 vehicles sold by category, model, and year.
