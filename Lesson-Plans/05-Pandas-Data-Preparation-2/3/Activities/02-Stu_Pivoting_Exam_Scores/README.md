# Pivoting Exam Scores

In this activity, you will use the `pivot_table()` function on a DataFrame to reshape exam score data.

## Instructions

1. Read the `exam_scores.csv` file into a DataFrame named `exam_scores_df`.

2. Reshape the `exam_scores_df` DataFrame to show the average exam score for each "subject". The columns are the subject and the values are the exam scores. Rename the index "Avg_Subject_Score" and round the results to one decimal place.

3. Reshape the `exam_scores_df` DataFrame to show the minimum and maximum score for each subject.

4. Reshape the `exam_scores_df` DataFrame to show the average score for each student across all subjects. Rename the index "Avg. Student Score" and round the results to one decimal place.

5. Reshape the `exam_scores_df` DataFrame to show each student's exam score for each subject. The student names are the columns, the subject is the index, and the values are the exam scores.
