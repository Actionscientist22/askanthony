# AI Travel Agent

You may have already used ChatGPT to support business related tasks (to develop a resume or draft a cover letter), but ChatGPT can be a helpful tool in many aspects of daily life. In this activity, ChatGPT will serve as your personal travel agent.

## Background

This activity has two parts:

First, you’ll engineer a series of effective prompts to allow ChatGPT to assist you in planning your dream vacation. Then, once you’re happy with your itinerary, you’ll design a new set of prompts to guide ChatGPT as it develops a walking tour of a city that you’re interested in visiting.

Before getting started, keep these things in mind:

* To protect your own privacy, never include sensitive or personal information in a prompt.

* Before sharing content developed by ChatGPT with others, be sure to revise the output to make it feel more “human” and personalized.

* While using the tools in this course should reduce the chance of triggering AI hallucinations, it’s important to always verify the output for accuracy.

## Instructions

**Part 1: Develop Your Itinerary**

1. Instruct ChatGPT to develop an itinerary based on your preferences. Before you begin, decide what type of prompting approach makes the most sense given your objective. Will you use zero-shot, one-shot, or few-shot prompting? Consider varying your approach at each stage of the process.

 Be sure to include the length of time for your trip, where you will be traveling from, and the types of vacations you enjoy. Are you looking for a resort on the beach, an epic travel adventure, or something in between? Include these instructions in your prompt.

2. Revise your prompt. This time, add examples of your favorite vacation destinations from the past. How did that affect the output? Is it closer to the type of itinerary you were looking for?

3. Provide the algorithm with feedback and ask it to generate a new output. Are there any places it suggested going that you’re not interested in visiting? Include that in your next input and explain why. See how the response changes.

4. Next, try “forcing” ChatGPT into a role. In this case, try informing the algorithm that it will be working as your “helpful travel agent.” How does the output change based on this new information?

5. Ask ChatGPT to suggest hotels for each night of your itinerary. Provide parameters such as distance to the city center, criteria for traveler reviews, and whether you prefer budget or luxury accommodation. This is a good opportunity to use chain-of-thought prompting by asking the algorithm to provide justification as to why it suggested the hotels that it did.

**Part 2: Plan a Walking Tour**

1. Select a city from the itinerary and ask ChatGPT to design a walking tour tailored to your interests. Would you like a history tour, a food tour, a museum tour, or something else entirely? 

2. Provide the algorithm the data points it needs to suggest a tour just for you. Be sure to include details like how far you’re comfortable walking and the duration of the tour. Provide examples of the types of things you like to do and things you want to avoid. If you have any mobility or dietary restrictions, be sure to include them in your prompt so ChatGPT can take them into account.

3. Revise your prompt by forcing the algorithm into a very specific role as a tour guide. Are you taking a walking tour of London? Consider asking the algorithm to give you a tour in the voice of Winston Churchill. Visiting Paris? Ask a reliable, world-renowned art historian to design your tour of the Louvre.

## Hints

* Complete each step one at a time. Review the type of response you receive before moving onto the next step to see how the response changes based on the input.

* Prompting citations may be particularly helpful for Part 2. Consider what types of citations would be the most helpful, depending on the type of tour you’re designing. For example, if you ask ChatGPT to design a history tour, consider asking it to provide citations of the historical facts you’ll learn on your tour. If you choose a food tour, ask it to tell you how many stars a specific restaurant received on Yelp or other review sites.

**Remember:** It's always okay to ask for help if you get stuck.
