      "This week's workout plan focuses on overall strength and conditioning. Here's a summary of what you should do:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Monday: Start with a dynamic warm-up to prepare your body for exercise. Then, perform compound exercises such as squats, deadlifts, bench press, and overhead press. Aim for 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps with challenging weights. Finish with some core exercises like planks and Russian twists.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Tuesday: Incorporate cardiovascular exercise for endurance. Go for a 30-45 minute run, cycle, or swim at a moderate intensity. If you prefer a low-impact option, try an elliptical or rowing machine. Remember to stretch and cool down afterward.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Wednesday: Focus on upper body strength. Include exercises like push-ups, pull-ups, rows, and shoulder presses. Aim for 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps. Add in some bicep and tricep exercises for additional arm strength. Don't forget to stretch and foam roll your upper body muscles.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Thursday: Engage in a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) session. Choose exercises like burpees, mountain climbers, jump squats, and kettlebell swings. Perform each exercise for 30 seconds with maximum effort, followed by a 15-second rest. Repeat the circuit for 4-5 rounds. This will help improve your cardiovascular fitness and burn calories.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Friday: Take a break from intense workouts and focus on active recovery. Go for a light jog, do some yoga or Pilates, or try a low-impact workout like swimming or cycling. The goal is to promote blood flow, flexibility, and relaxation.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Saturday: Incorporate a full-body circuit workout. Include exercises like lunges, step-ups, push-ups, planks, and kettlebell swings. Perform each exercise for 45 seconds with minimal rest in between. Complete 3-4 rounds. This will challenge your entire body and improve overall strength and endurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Sunday: Rest and recover. Allow your body to heal and recharge for the upcoming week. Take this time to stretch, foam roll, and engage in activities that promote relaxation and stress reduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember to listen to your body throughout the week. If you experience any pain or discomfort, modify or skip exercises as needed. Stay hydrated, eat a balanced diet, and get enough sleep to support your workouts.\n"
