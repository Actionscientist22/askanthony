    "The Open Library Search API is one of the most convenient and complete ways to retrieve book data on Open Library. The API:\n",
    "\n",
    "Is able to return data for multiple books in a single request/response\n",
    "Returns both Work level information about the book, as well as Edition level information (such as)\n",
    "Author IDs are returned which you can use to fetch the author's image, if available\n",
    "Options are available to return Book Availability along with the response.\n",
    "Powerful sorting options are available, such as star ratings, publication date, and number of editions.\n",
    "Endpoint\n",
    "The endpoint for this API is:\n",
    "https://openlibrary.org/search.json\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "The URL format for API is simple. Take the search URL and add .json to the end. Eg:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://openlibrary.org/search.json?q=the+lord+of+the+rings\n",

    "https://openlibrary.org/search/authors.json?q=twain\n",
    "Using Thing IDs to get Images\n",
    "You can use the olid (Open Library ID) for authors and books to fetch covers by olid, e.g.:\n",

    "\n",

    "fields\tThe fields to get back from solr. Use the special value * to get all fields (although be prepared for a very large response!).\n",
    "To fetch availability data from archive.org, add the special value, availability. Example: /search.json?q=harry%20potter&fields=*,availability&limit=1. This will fetch the availability data of the first item in the `ia` field.\n",
    "sort\tYou can sort the results by various facets such as new, old, random, or key (which sorts as a string, not as the number stored in the string). For a complete list of sorts facets look here (this link goes to a specific commit, be sure to look at the latest one for changes). The default is to sort by relevance.\n",
    "lang\tThe users language as a two letter (ISO 639-1) language code. This influences but doesn't exclude search results. For example setting this to fr will prefer/display the French edition of a given work, but will still match works that don't have French editions. Adding language:fre on the other hand to the search query will exclude results that don't have a French edition.\n",
