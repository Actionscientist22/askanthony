      "1. Sports-themed art workshop: Combine Andrew's love for sports with Allison's interest in art by organizing a workshop where participants can create sports-inspired artwork. This allows Andrew to engage with his passion for wrestling while providing an opportunity for Allison to express her creativity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Talent show: Organize a talent show where participants can showcase their unique talents and abilities. This activity allows Claire to enjoy being popular and part of the in-crowd, while also providing a platform for John to rebel against authority figures through his rock music performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Outdoor adventure day: Plan a day filled with outdoor activities such as hiking, rock climbing, or team-building exercises. This allows Andrew to engage in physical activities he enjoys, while also providing an opportunity for Claire to hop around and be part of a group. John can find an outlet for his rebellious nature in the adventurous spirit of the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember to create an inclusive and supportive environment where everyone feels comfortable and valued. It's important to encourage open-mindedness and respect for each other's interests and preferences. I hope these suggestions help, and if you need more specific ideas or assistance with planning, feel free to let me know!\n"
