# Generative AI

Now that you’ve learned about how generative AI works, it’s time to try it out yourself. In this activity, you’ll generate a piece of music or an image with the help of generative AI.

## Background

In the lesson so far, you’ve learned about how generative AI technologies function similarly, whether they are generating text, images, or music. In this activity, you’ll have the option of choosing between developing an image or a piece of music.

Recall that image-generation models are trained to recognize noise and predict what the cleared up image should look like. This training process involves first adding noise to an image, then using the model to predict the original image by using the information in the noisy version of the image. In essence, image generation then happens in reverse: a noisy image is generated based on text descriptors (labels). The model then identifies the “level” of noise in this image and clarifies it with a predictive algorithm (Isaacs-Thomas, 2023).

Just like text- and image-generating models, music generators use complex transformers to identify and associate prompts and parts of prompts with particular qualities in sound data.

Just like with their application in text and image generators, transformers can also be trained to analyze existing data&mdash;in this case, pieces of music&mdash;and categorize them with particular labels that can be pulled from user prompts. This process can be used to identify styles and genres, musical keys and transitions, tempos and beats, and any number of the many parts that come together to craft a piece of music. Producers can then prompt these algorithms with descriptions of their desired song to have it create a new piece to their precise specifications (Black, 2023).

There are dozens of generative AI tools available, and you likely have already put some of them to use. The goal of this activity is to give you an additional tool to draw from, so we recommend using a tool that is new to you.

## Instructions

1. Select a generative AI tool from the following list:

     Image Generators

    * [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2) is a popular image generator from OpenAI that, like Stable Diffusion, generates images based on text prompts using “contrastive learning” that trains transformers to associate text descriptions with related images (Bullas, 2023).

    * [Artbreeder](https://www.artbreeder.com/) is unique among image generators in that it doesn’t require text prompts. Instead, users can manipulate images through a range of sliders to create their own original artwork.

    * [DeepArt.io](https://creativitywith.ai/deepartio/) takes user images and recreates them in the styles of significant art movements, such as Pop Art or Impressionism.

     Music Generators

    * [Aimi](https://www.aimi.fm/) can craft and output a new sound file that can be modified to the producer’s liking without them having to compose, record, and assemble a final mix from scratch.

    * [Soudraw](https://soundraw.io/) allows users to generate their own royalty-free music based on the mood, genre, and length of song requested.

2. Prompt the tool to generate either an image or a piece of music. Try to envision the output that you want, as you’ll be asked to evaluate the success of the tool later in the activity.

3. Make at least one change to your prompt to make the output closer to your expectations. Have the tool develop a new image or piece of music based on the altered prompt.

4. Reflect on the following questions. Be prepared to share your responses with the class in the next activity.

    * Which prompt engineering techniques did you use?

    * How closely did the output from the AI tool meet your expectations?

    * When you changed the prompt, did the output get closer to your expectations, or further away?

    * Given more time, what steps would you take to further refine the output?

## Hints

* This is a great opportunity to use the prompt engineering skills that you developed earlier in the lesson.

* Though the instructions only require you to make one change to your prompt, feel free to make additional updates until the output meets your expectations.

**Remember:** It's always okay to ask for help if you get stuck.
