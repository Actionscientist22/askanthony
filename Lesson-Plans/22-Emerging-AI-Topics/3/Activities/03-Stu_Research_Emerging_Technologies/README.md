In this activity, you’ll conduct research on recent developments about an AI technology of your choice.

## Background

AI technology is constantly evolving. In order to maintain a long-term career in the field, it will be critical for you to keep up to date with emerging technologies. 

In this lesson, you were introduced to a number of exciting new fields of AI research and development. Now you’ll be tasked with conducting your own research on an emerging field of AI technology. Then, you’ll be asked to respond to a series of questions about your research.  Be prepared to discuss your findings with the class in the next activity.

## Instructions

1. First, use Google News to find an article about an emerging field of AI technology that is of interest to you. You may want to focus your search on one of the topics that we’ve already covered: 

   * Generative AI
   * Autonomous vehicles and computer vision
   * Robots
   * Internet of Things (IoT)
   * Mobile AI
   * One-shot learning
   * 3D environments

Alternatively, your research can focus on an entirely new field.

Hints: 

   * Limit your search to articles that have been published in the last six months.

   * Use only reputable sources, such as universities or well-respected publishers and news organizations.

   * Try combining search terms like “Generative AI” and/or “recent developments” with names of specific fields or industries, such as “finance” or “medicine.”

2. After you have conducted your research, answer the following questions:

   * What specific advancements or breakthroughs did you discover in the topic you chose?

   * How do these advancements contribute to or impact the current landscape of artificial intelligence?

   * How do the latest technologies or methodologies discussed in your research align with or differ from the traditional approaches in AI that we’ve covered in this course?

   * In what ways do you see the applications of AI in this emerging field influencing various industries or domains?
