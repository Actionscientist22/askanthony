# Predicting Malware with KNN

## Introduction

In this activity, you'll determine the best k-value in KNN to predict malware.

## Instructions

* Use the starter file for this activity.

* Calculate the training and testing scores for k ranging from 1 to 20. Use only odd numbers for the k-values.

* Plot the k-values for both the training and the testing data to determine where the best combination of scores occurs. This point has the optimal k-value for your model.

* Retrain your model by using the k-value that you found to have the best scores. Print the score for this value with the scaled testing data.
