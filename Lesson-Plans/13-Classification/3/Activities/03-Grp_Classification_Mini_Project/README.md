# Classification Mini Project

## Introduction

In this mini group project, you will work in small groups to examine datasets and select one to perform preprocessing tasks, followed by training the data on multiple classification models before evaluating which one performs the best. You will have the option of using binary or multiclass data for the mini project.

## Part 1: Review Datasets

Review the datasets below and select one that your group would like to use with this in-class mini project.

**Binary Classification Datasets**

* Customer churn ([dataset](https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m13/lesson_3/datasets/customer-churn.csv)) ([info](https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m13/lesson_3/datasets/customer-churn.names))

* Sports article objectivity ([dataset](https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m13/lesson_3/datasets/sports-articles.csv)) ([info](https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m13/lesson_3/datasets/sports-articles.names))

**Multiclass Classification Datasets**

* Letter recognition ([dataset](https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m13/lesson_3/datasets/letter-recognition.csv)) ([info](https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m13/lesson_3/datasets/letter-recognition.names))

* Website phishing ([dataset](https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m13/lesson_3/datasets/phishing.csv)) ([info](https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m13/lesson_3/datasets/phishing.names))

* Orthopedic patients (normal, disk hernia or spondylolisthesis) ([dataset](https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m13/lesson_3/datasets/vertebral-column.csv)) ([info](https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m13/lesson_3/datasets/vertebral-column.names))

## Part 2: Data Preprocessing

1. Determine which of the following preprocessing tasks should be performed on your selected dataset:

    * `train_test_split()`

    * Scaling (`StandardScaler()` or `MinMaxScaler()`)

    * Encode categorical data (`LabelEncoder()` and/or `OneHotEncoder()`)

      * **Note:** `LabelEncoder()` should be used for target variables and `OneHotEncoder()` should be used for features.

2. Perform the required preprocessing tasks as determined in the previous step.

## Part 3: Model Training and Evaluation

1. Choose at least 3 of the following classification models to train with your selected dataset:

    * Logistic regression

    * Support vector machine (SVM)

      **Note:** You may choose any kernel, it doesn't have to be `linear`.

    * K-nearest neighbor (KNN)

    * Decision tree classifier

    * Random forest classifier

    * Extremely random trees classifier

    * Gradient boosting classifier

    * Adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) classifier

2. Train the models on the preprocessed data.

3. Evaluate the models using `model.score` on the training and testing data.

4. **Optional:** If time permits, you may like to build the previous steps into a machine learning pipeline, as covered in a previous module. Alternatively, see if you can create a function that will automate the process of training and evaluating a model, i.e., create a function that accepts a model and the data to be trained, then prints out the accuracy score for the training and testing data.

## Part 4: Discuss Results

Return to the full class and discuss your process and results.
