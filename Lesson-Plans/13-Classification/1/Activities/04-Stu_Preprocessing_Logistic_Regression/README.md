# Preprocessing with Logistic Regression

## Introduction

In this activity, you will practice scaling data prior to training a logistic regression model. Recall that the Scalar instance must be fit to the training data prior to scaling both the training and testing sets.

## Instructions

1. Open the starter file to load the dependencies and data.

2. Create the `X` set by dropping the `Churn` column.

3. Create the `y` set from the `Churn` column.

4. Split the data into training and testing sets, setting `random_state=1`.

5. Test the accuracy of the models that are trained using scaled data for both the `StandardScalar` and `MinMaxScalar` by performing the following actions for each method:

    * Create the scalar instance and fit it to the `X_train` data.

    * Scale the `X_train` data.

    * Scale the `X_test` data.

    * Create a `LogisticRegression()` model and fit it to the scaled `X_train_scaled` and `y_train` sets.

    * Check the accuracy score for both the scaled training and testing sets using `model.score()`.

6. Answer the question: Which scalar instance produces a better accuracy score on the scaled testing data?
