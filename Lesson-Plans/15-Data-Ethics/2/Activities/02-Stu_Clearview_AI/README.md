# Clearview AI

In this activity, you’ll review and discuss the ways that Clearview AI obtains and uses information about people for its facial recognition tool.

## Instructions

1. Review the following websites and articles. Focus on the key points that the opening paragraphs describe, and then read any subheadings in the sections that follow. You don’t need to read the websites and articles in their entirety.

    * [Overview | Clearview AI](https://www.clearview.ai/overview)

    * [Clearview AI Facing £17 Million Fine From UK ICO Over Violation of Data Protection Laws](https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-privacy/clearview-ai-facing-17-million-fine-from-uk-ico-over-violation-of-data-protection-laws/) by Scott Ikeda in *CPO Magazine*

    * [The world’s scariest facial recognition company, explained](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/11/21131991/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-database-law-enforcement) by Rebecca Heilweil on *Vox*

    * [The Inconsentability of Facial Surveillance](https://www.techpolicy.com/Articles/I/Inconsentability-of-Facial-Surveillance.aspx) by Woodrow Hartzog and Evan Selinger on Technology | Academics | Policy

2. Discuss the following questions with your group:

    * How do you feel about Clearview AI storing images of your face in its database?

    * Does the availability of images online make them OK to use in the way that Clearview AI is using them? Should this be legal?

    * Does the ability of Clearview AI to support criminal investigations justify the way that it infringes on individual privacy?

    * Given what you learned about issues with facial recognition accuracy from the [Gender Shades project](http://gendershades.org/overview.html), do you have any concerns about Clearview AI misidentifying certain types of people?

    * Do you think the fines that were levied against Clearview AI will change how it does business? Do you think that the fines were appropriate?

3. Be prepared to share insights from your discussion with the rest of the class.


## Hints

* Be sure to include all group members in your discussion. Bringing in different perspectives will help everyone to better understand the issues at hand.
