# Project Street Bump

In this activity, you’ll review the case of Boston’s [Project Street Bump](http://www.streetbump.org/), which was designed to help fix potholes in the city. 

## Background

In 2012, Boston released an innovative new project called Project Street Bump, which was designed to help fix potholes in the city. [Project Street Bump](http://www.streetbump.org/) was a smart phone app that Bostonians could use to collect data about road conditions while driving. That data was then shared with the city government so that it could fix problems with roads. The city also used this data to inform planning of long-term projects. After it launched, data scientists determined that the initiative’s data was biased. 

## Instructions

1. Review the overview of the [Project Street Bump](http://www.streetbump.org/). Be sure to engage with the video.

2. Summarize the project by answering the following questions (feel free to use text quotations from the website and video to support your answers):

    * What did the initiative do?
    * What problems was it designed to solve?
    * Keeping in mind that this initiative was launched in 2012, who do you think is most likely to use the Project Street Bump app?
    * What issues of exclusion could be raised by Project Street Bump?
    * What would be the impact of the exclusion?

3. Now imagine that you are designing an AI algorithm to replace the Project Street Bump app.  Consider the following questions:

    * What training data will you use?
    * How will users interact with your algorithm?
    * How will you avoid the pitfalls of exclusion caused by Project Street Bump?


## Hints

* If you’re having trouble, review the following article: [The Hidden Biases in Big Data from *Harvard Business Review*](https://hbr.org/2013/04/the-hidden-biases-in-big-data)

**Remember:** It's always okay to ask for help if you get stuck.
