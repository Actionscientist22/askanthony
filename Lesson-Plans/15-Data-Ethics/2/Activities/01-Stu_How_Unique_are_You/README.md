# How Unique am I?

In this activity, you’ll use the “How unique am I?” tool created by Dr. Sweeney’s Data Privacy Lab at Harvard to see how “unique” you are in the context of your publicly available information.

## Background

Privacy scholar Dr. LaTanya Sweeney has repeatedly demonstrated how easy it is to identify specific people from an "anonymized" dataset, exposing significant systemic flaws and threats to privacy in large record systems. 

In the late 1990s, after the Massachusetts Group Insurance Commission publicly released "anonymized" data on hospital visits by state employees, Dr. Sweeney showed that she was easily able to identify a specific person within these records by finding the health records of the governor of Massachusetts at the time, Bill Weld. She did this by simply linking Cambridge voter-registrations with information in the hospital visits dataset.

Although Dr. Sweeney's work has led to reforms in privacy laws and regulations, her team at Harvard has continued to find instances where joining two publicly available datasets leads to identifying sensitive information about individuals.

## Instructions

1. Navigate to [AboutMyInfo.org](https://aboutmyinfo.org/identity). Input the information when prompted (Date of Birth, Gender, and Zip Code).

2. Review your results.

3. Answer the following questions:

    * How easy is it to identify you based on your date of birth, birth year, and age range?

    * How do these results make you feel? 

    * What kind of information is available about you online? Have you shared information on social media platforms? Do you have a personal website? Are you listed on your employer’s website? If someone were to search for information about you using a search engine, what do you think they would be able to find? For example, could they find your email address, zip code, or birth year?

    * Can you think of any anonymized data sources that may include information about you? Does the city you live in have an open data portal? Have you had any real estate or other legal transactions that may have been included in a public database? What about your voting records?

    * How difficult do you think it would be for someone to use your personal information that is available online to identify you in an anonymized dataset?

    * How do you feel about your privacy? Has this exercise changed how you feel about your inclusion in anonymized datasets?
