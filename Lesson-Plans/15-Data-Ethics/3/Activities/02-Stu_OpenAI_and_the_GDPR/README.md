# OpenAI and the GDPR

In this activity, you'll read an article about accusations of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) privacy violations filed against ChatGPT developer, Open AI.

## Background

In August 2023, Lukasz Olejnik, a Polish security and privacy researcher, filed a complaint against OpenAI for violating a number of privacy protections established by the GDPR.

Olejnik became aware of the issue when he used ChatGPT to draft a biography of himself and it produced text that contained errors. Under GDPR protections, users have a right to have inaccurate information about themselves corrected. Despite several communications with OpenAI, the company failed to rectify the inaccuracies, leaving Olejnik's concerns unaddressed.
