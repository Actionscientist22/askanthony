# US Data Regulation Deep Dive

In this activity, you'll research a regulation field from the following list, review it with your group, and find an example of when the regulation (or regulations in the field of finance) was violated. 

In your professional journey, understanding the intricacies of US data regulations can be paramount. By diving deeper into these regulations, you can gauge the nuances and the real-world implications of non-compliance.


## Instructions

1. Find your regulation in the US regulations document, which is contained in the Activity file. Read the description of the regulation assigned by your instructor, then skim the text of the provided link.

  * **Children**&mdash;Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA)

  * **Communications**&mdash;Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA)

  * **Education**&mdash;Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA)

  * **Finance**&mdash; Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 (FCRA) and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA)

  * **Healthcare**&mdash;Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)

2. As a group, discuss what your chosen regulation field governs, and summarize what this rule(s) requires of the people and organizations that must follow it.

3. Type the name of your rule followed by “violation” in your preferred search engine. If the search engine has a way to specifically search for news articles, use that to help narrow down your search.

4. In your group, share what you find. Then, as a group, decide on a violation to discuss. For this violation, answer the following questions:

    * Who violated the rule?

    * What specific aspect of the rule did they violate?

    * Who was responsible for enforcing the rule when it was violated?

    * How did that responsible person or organization enforce the rule?

    * Do you agree with how the rule was enforced? Do you think the punishment was fair?

    * How would this law relate to an AI system?

5. Choose someone from your group to share a summary of your discussion.

## Hints

* If time permits, either discuss another violation of your chosen rule or research violations of a different rule from the list in Step 1.

**Remember:** It's always okay to ask for help if you get stuck.
