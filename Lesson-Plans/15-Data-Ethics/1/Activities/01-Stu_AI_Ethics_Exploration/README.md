# AI Ethics Exploration

In this activity, you’ll conduct research on an AI issue of your choice.

## Instructions

1. First, use Google News to find an article about AI ethics that is of interest to you. You may want to focus your search on one of the topics that we’ve already covered (privacy, consent, or accountability) or you may choose to focus on another topic entirely.

   * Limit your search to an article that has been published in the last six months.

   * Use only reputable sources, such as universities or well-respected publishers and news organizations.

* Try combining search terms like “AI privacy violation” with names of specific fields or industries, such as “finance” or “medicine.”

2. After you have found and read the article, answer the following questions:

   * Can you summarize the essence of the case in a sentence or two that you can present to the class?

   * How familiar were you with the ethical topic before you started this activity?

   * Does this case raise any questions about other ethical quandaries with which you may be familiar?

   * If you were in a position to address the ethical issue raised in the article you chose, what would you do and why?

## Hints

* Once you decide upon a topic, consider re-doing your Google News search to find another article with a different perspective from the original article. Considering all sides of the issue may give you more insight into the topic and your own feelings on it.

**Remember:** It's always okay to ask for help if you get stuck.
