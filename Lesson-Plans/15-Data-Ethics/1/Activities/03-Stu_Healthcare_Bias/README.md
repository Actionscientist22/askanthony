# Healthcare Bias

In this activity, you’ll learn about an instance of algorithmic bias in the healthcare industry.

## Background

In 2019, a team of researchers published an audit of an algorithm that the healthcare industry commonly used to predict which patients would need additional healthcare support. This algorithm assigned a risk score to each patient. Healthcare systems used these risk scores to allocate resources, providing more support to higher-risk patients.

The abstract of [Dissecting Racial Bias in an Algorithm Used to Manage the Health of Populations](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aax2342) suggests the following findings:

* Relative to White patients with the same risk score, Black patients experience more signs of uncontrolled illnesses.

* In order for Black patients to have similar health outcomes as White patients, 30% more Black patients would need to receive additional healthcare support.

* The differences in health outcomes between Black and White patients happens because the algorithm is structured to predict health costs rather than predict illness. Black patients have less access to care to start with, so this prediction approach perpetuates existing trends of spending less money on healthcare for Black patients than White patients.

## Instructions

1. Review the article [Racial Bias Found in a Major Health Care Risk Algorithm](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/racial-bias-found-in-a-major-health-care-risk-algorithm/) by Starre Vartan in *Scientific American*. This article summarizes the research that was published in *Science*. (The link to the abstract for that research appears earlier in this file.)

2. Summarize the article by answering the following questions (feel free to use quotations from the article to support your answers):

    * What did the algorithm do?
    * What information did the algorithm use to make its predictions?
    * What information did the researchers use to determine that the algorithm was biased?

3. Consider the following questions:

    * What was the impact of the algorithmic bias?
    * What were the primary causes of the bias?

## Hints

* It may help to read the article more than once.

**Remember:** It's always okay to ask for help if you get stuck.
