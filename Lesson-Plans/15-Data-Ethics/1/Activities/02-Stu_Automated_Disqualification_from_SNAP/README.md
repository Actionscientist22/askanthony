# Automated Disqualification from SNAP

In this activity, you’ll read a series of articles about three Somali markets in Seattle that were disqualified from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program in 2002.. 

## Background

SNAP is a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) program that assists low- and no-income people with purchasing food. People can use SNAP benefits as payment for certain types of food at certain stores. For grocery stores in low-income neighborhoods, SNAP purchases might provide the majority of their revenue. 

This was the case for three Somali markets in Seattle that were disqualified from the SNAP program in 2002, forcing customers to shop elsewhere. The USDA used a computer program to detect irregular purchasing patterns and flag them for fraud. The Somali community’s perfectly legal shopping habits were flagged because the program noticed that purchases at these grocery stores tended to be hundreds of dollars, significantly higher than the “average” SNAP transaction. Furthermore, the amounts tended to be numbers of dollars without cents, such as $150, due to the way the grocers chose to price their goods. By contrast, similar stores had an average transaction of $13.83.
