      "first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical\r\n",
      "vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of\r\n",
      "sight of land?  Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy?  Why did\r\n",
      "the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove?  Surely\r\n",
      "all this is not without meaning.  And still deeper the meaning of\r\n",
      "that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the\r\n",
      "tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and\r\n",
      "was drowned.  But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and\r\n",
      "oceans.  It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this\r\n",
      "is the key to it all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I\r\n",
      "begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of\r\n",
      "my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as\r\n",
      "a passenger.  For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse,\r\n",
      "and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it.  Besides,\r\n",
      "passengers get sea-sick--grow quarrelsome--don't sleep of nights--do\r\n",
      "not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;--no, I never go as a\r\n",
      "passenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea\r\n",
      "as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook.  I abandon the glory and\r\n",
      "distinction of such offices to those who like them.  For my part, I\r\n",
      "abominate all honourable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations\r\n",
      "of every kind whatsoever.  It is quite as much as I can do to take\r\n",
      "care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs,\r\n",
      "schooners, and what not.  And as for going as cook,--though I confess\r\n",
      "there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer\r\n",
      "on ship-board--yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;--though\r\n",
      "once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and\r\n",
      "peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to\r\n",
      "say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will.  It is out of the\r\n",
      "idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted\r\n",
      "river horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their\r\n",
      "huge bake-houses the pyramids.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,\r\n",
      "plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.\r\n",
      "True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to\r\n",
      "spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow.  And at first, this sort of\r\n",
      "thing is unpleasant enough.  It touches one's sense of honour,\r\n",
      "particularly if you come of an old established family in the land,\r\n",
      "the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes.  And more than\r\n",
      "all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have\r\n",
      "been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys\r\n",
      "stand in awe of you.  The transition is a keen one, I assure you,\r\n",
      "from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of\r\n",
      "Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it.  But even\r\n",
      "this wears off in time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a\r\n",
      "broom and sweep down the decks?  What does that indignity amount to,\r\n",
      "weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament?  Do you think\r\n",
      "the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I\r\n",
      "promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular\r\n",
      "instance?  Who ain't a slave?  Tell me that.  Well, then, however the\r\n",
      "old sea-captains may order me about--however they may thump and punch\r\n",
      "me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right;\r\n",
      "that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same\r\n",
      "way--either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and\r\n",
      "so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each\r\n",
      "other's shoulder-blades, and be content.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of\r\n",
      "paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single\r\n",
      "penny that I ever heard of.  On the contrary, passengers themselves\r\n",
      "must pay.  And there is all the difference in the world between\r\n",
      "paying and being paid.  The act of paying is perhaps the most\r\n",
      "uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon\r\n",
      "us.  But BEING PAID,--what will compare with it?  The urbane activity\r\n",
      "with which a man receives money is really marvellous, considering\r\n",
      "that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly\r\n",
      "ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven.  Ah! how\r\n",
      "cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome\r\n",
      "exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck.  For as in this world,\r\n",
      "head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if\r\n",
      "you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the\r\n",
      "Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from\r\n",
      "the sailors on the forecastle.  He thinks he breathes it first; but\r\n",
      "not so.  In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in\r\n",
      "many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect\r\n",
      "it.  But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea\r\n",
      "as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a\r\n",
      "whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who\r\n",
      "has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and\r\n",
      "influences me in some unaccountable way--he can better answer than\r\n",
      "any one else.  And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage,\r\n",
      "formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a\r\n",
      "long time ago.  It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo\r\n",
      "between more extensive performances.  I take it that this part of the\r\n",

      "Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers,\r\n",
      "the Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when\r\n",
      "others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and\r\n",
      "short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in\r\n",
      "farces--though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I\r\n",
      "recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the\r\n",
      "springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under\r\n",
      "various disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did,\r\n",
      "besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting\r\n",
      "from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great\r\n",
      "whale himself.  Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all\r\n",
      "my curiosity.  Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his\r\n",
      "island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these,\r\n",
      "with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and\r\n",
      "sounds, helped to sway me to my wish.  With other men, perhaps, such\r\n",
      "things would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented\r\n",
      "with an everlasting itch for things remote.  I love to sail forbidden\r\n",
      "seas, and land on barbarous coasts.  Not ignoring what is good, I am\r\n",
      "quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social with it--would\r\n",

      "By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the\r\n",
      "great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild\r\n",
      "conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into\r\n",
      "my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my\r\n",
      "arm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific.  Quitting the good\r\n",
      "city of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford.  It was a\r\n",
      "Saturday night in December.  Much was I disappointed upon learning\r\n",
      "that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no\r\n",
      "way of reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop\r\n",
      "at this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as\r\n",
      "well be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing.  For my\r\n",
      "mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because\r\n",
      "there was a fine, boisterous something about everything connected\r\n",
      "with that famous old island, which amazingly pleased me.  Besides\r\n",
      "though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the\r\n",
      "business of whaling, and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is\r\n",
      "now much behind her, yet Nantucket was her great original--the Tyre\r\n",
      "of this Carthage;--the place where the first dead American whale was\r\n",
      "stranded.  Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal\r\n",
      "whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to give chase to the\r\n",

      "Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before\r\n",
      "me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it\r\n",
      "became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep\r\n",
      "meanwhile.  It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and\r\n",
      "dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless.  I knew no one in the\r\n",
      "place.  With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and only\r\n",
      "brought up a few pieces of silver,--So, wherever you go, Ishmael,\r\n",

      "With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of \"The\r\n",

      "flinty projections, because from hard, remorseless service the soles\r\n",
      "of my boots were in a most miserable plight.  Too expensive and\r\n",
      "jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the broad glare\r\n",
      "in the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within.\r\n",
      "But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don't you hear? get away from\r\n",
      "before the door; your patched boots are stopping the way.  So on I\r\n",
      "went.  I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward,\r\n",

      "Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either\r\n",

      "tomb.  At this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that\r\n",
      "quarter of the town proved all but deserted.  But presently I came to\r\n",
      "a smoky light proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which\r\n",
      "stood invitingly open.  It had a careless look, as if it were meant\r\n",
      "for the uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Coffin?--Spouter?--Rather ominous in that particular connexion,\r\n",

      "suppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there.  As the light\r\n",
      "looked so dim, and the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and\r\n",
      "the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have\r\n",
      "been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district, and as the\r\n",
      "swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It was a queer sort of place--a gable-ended old house, one side\r\n",
      "palsied as it were, and leaning over sadly.  It stood on a sharp\r\n",
      "bleak corner, where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse\r\n",
      "howling than ever it did about poor Paul's tossed craft.  Euroclydon,\r\n",

      "difference, whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where\r\n",

      "though, and thrust in a little lint here and there.  But it's too\r\n",
      "late to make any improvements now.  The universe is finished; the\r\n",

      "plug up both ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,\r\n",
      "low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of\r\n",
      "the bulwarks of some condemned old craft.  On one side hung a very\r\n",
      "large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced,\r\n",
      "that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only\r\n",
      "by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, and\r\n",
      "careful inquiry of the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an\r\n",
      "understanding of its purpose.  Such unaccountable masses of shades\r\n",
      "and shadows, that at first you almost thought some ambitious young\r\n",
      "artist, in the time of the New England hags, had endeavored to\r\n",
      "delineate chaos bewitched.  But by dint of much and earnest\r\n",
      "contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and especially by\r\n",
      "throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry, you at\r\n",
      "last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild, might\r\n",
      "not be altogether unwarranted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber,\r\n",
      "portentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the\r\n",
      "picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a\r\n",
      "nameless yeast.  A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to\r\n",
      "drive a nervous man distracted.  Yet was there a sort of indefinite,\r\n",
      "half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you\r\n",
      "to it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out\r\n",
      "what that marvellous painting meant.  Ever and anon a bright, but,\r\n",
      "alas, deceptive idea would dart you through.--It's the Black Sea in a\r\n",
      "midnight gale.--It's the unnatural combat of the four primal\r\n",
      "elements.--It's a blasted heath.--It's a Hyperborean winter\r\n",
      "scene.--It's the breaking-up of the icebound stream of Time.  But at\r\n",
      "last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in\r\n",
      "the picture's midst.  THAT once found out, and all the rest were\r\n",
      "plain.  But stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic\r\n",
      "fish? even the great leviathan himself?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In fact, the artist's design seemed this: a final theory of my own,\r\n",
      "partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with\r\n",
      "whom I conversed upon the subject.  The picture represents a\r\n",
      "Cape-Horner in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering\r\n",
      "there with its three dismantled masts alone visible; and an\r\n",
      "exasperated whale, purposing to spring clean over the craft, is in\r\n",
      "the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish\r\n",
      "array of monstrous clubs and spears.  Some were thickly set with\r\n",
      "glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots\r\n",
      "of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping\r\n",
      "round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed\r\n",
      "mower.  You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous\r\n",
      "cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such\r\n",
      "a hacking, horrifying implement.  Mixed with these were rusty old\r\n",
      "whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed.  Some were\r\n",
      "storied weapons.  With this once long lance, now wildly elbowed,\r\n",
      "fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a\r\n",
      "sunrise and a sunset.  And that harpoon--so like a corkscrew now--was\r\n",
      "flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale, years afterwards\r\n",
      "slain off the Cape of Blanco.  The original iron entered nigh the\r\n",
      "tail, and, like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man,\r\n",
      "travelled full forty feet, and at last was found imbedded in the\r\n",
      "hump.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way--cut\r\n",
      "through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with\r\n",
      "fireplaces all round--you enter the public room.  A still duskier\r\n",
      "place is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old\r\n",
      "wrinkled planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some\r\n",
      "old craft's cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this\r\n",
      "corner-anchored old ark rocked so furiously.  On one side stood a\r\n",
      "long, low, shelf-like table covered with cracked glass cases, filled\r\n",
      "with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world's remotest nooks.\r\n",
      "Projecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark-looking\r\n",
      "den--the bar--a rude attempt at a right whale's head.  Be that how it\r\n",
      "may, there stands the vast arched bone of the whale's jaw, so wide, a\r\n",
      "coach might almost drive beneath it.  Within are shabby shelves,\r\n",
      "ranged round with old decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws\r\n",
      "of swift destruction, like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed\r\n",
      "they called him), bustles a little withered old man, who, for their\r\n",
      "money, dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison.  Though\r\n",
      "true cylinders without--within, the villanous green goggling glasses\r\n",
      "deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom.  Parallel\r\n",
      "meridians rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads'\r\n",
      "goblets.  Fill to THIS mark, and your charge is but a penny; to THIS\r\n",

      "Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered\r\n",
      "about a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of\r\n",
      "SKRIMSHANDER.  I sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be\r\n",
      "accommodated with a room, received for answer that his house was\r\n",
      "full--not a bed unoccupied.  \"But avast,\" he added, tapping his\r\n",
      "forehead, \"you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer's blanket,\r\n",

      "to that sort of thing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should\r\n",
      "ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and\r\n",
      "that if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the\r\n",
      "harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander\r\n",
      "further about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up\r\n",
      "with the half of any decent man's blanket.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I thought so.  All right; take a seat.  Supper?--you want supper?\r\n",
      "Supper'll be ready directly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on\r\n",
      "the Battery.  At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning\r\n",
      "it with his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at\r\n",
      "the space between his legs.  He was trying his hand at a ship under\r\n",
      "full sail, but he didn't make much headway, I thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an\r\n",
      "adjoining room.  It was cold as Iceland--no fire at all--the landlord\r\n",
      "said he couldn't afford it.  Nothing but two dismal tallow candles,\r\n",
      "each in a winding sheet.  We were fain to button up our monkey\r\n",
      "jackets, and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half\r\n",
      "frozen fingers.  But the fare was of the most substantial kind--not\r\n",
      "only meat and potatoes, but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for\r\n",
      "supper!  One young fellow in a green box coat, addressed himself to\r\n",
      "these dumplings in a most direful manner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My boy,\" said the landlord, \"you'll have the nightmare to a dead\r\n",
      "sartainty.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Landlord,\" I whispered, \"that aint the harpooneer is it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, \"the\r\n",
      "harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap.  He never eats dumplings, he\r\n",
      "don't--he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes 'em rare.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The devil he does,\" says I.  \"Where is that harpooneer?  Is he\r\n",
      "here?\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this \"dark\r\n",
      "complexioned\" harpooneer.  At any rate, I made up my mind that if it\r\n",
      "so turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get\r\n",
      "into bed before I did.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not\r\n",
      "what else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the\r\n",
      "evening as a looker on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Presently a rioting noise was heard without.  Starting up, the\r\n",
      "landlord cried, \"That's the Grampus's crew.  I seed her reported in\r\n",
      "the offing this morning; a three years' voyage, and a full ship.\r\n",
      "Hurrah, boys; now we'll have the latest news from the Feegees.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung\r\n",
      "open, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough.  Enveloped in\r\n",
      "their shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen\r\n",
      "comforters, all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with\r\n",
      "icicles, they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador.  They had\r\n",
      "just landed from their boat, and this was the first house they\r\n",
      "entered.  No wonder, then, that they made a straight wake for the\r\n",
      "whale's mouth--the bar--when the wrinkled little old Jonah, there\r\n",
      "officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all round.  One complained\r\n",
      "of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like\r\n",
      "potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a sovereign cure for\r\n",
      "all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how long standing,\r\n",
      "or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the weather side\r\n",
      "of an ice-island.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even\r\n",
      "with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began\r\n",
      "capering about most obstreperously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though\r\n",
      "he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his\r\n",
      "own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much\r\n",
      "noise as the rest.  This man interested me at once; and since the\r\n",
      "sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though\r\n",
      "but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned),\r\n",
      "I will here venture upon a little description of him.  He stood full\r\n",
      "six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a\r\n",
      "coffer-dam.  I have seldom seen such brawn in a man.  His face was\r\n",
      "deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the\r\n",
      "contrast; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some\r\n",
      "reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.  His voice at\r\n",
      "once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature, I\r\n",
      "thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the\r\n",
      "Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia.  When the revelry of his companions\r\n",
      "had mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I\r\n",
      "saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea.  In a few\r\n",
      "minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and being, it\r\n",
      "seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised a cry\r\n",
      "of \"Bulkington!  Bulkington! where's Bulkington?\" and darted out of\r\n",
      "the house in pursuit of him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was now about nine o'clock, and the room seeming almost\r\n",
      "supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate\r\n",
      "myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to\r\n",
      "the entrance of the seamen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No man prefers to sleep two in a bed.  In fact, you would a good deal\r\n",
      "rather not sleep with your own brother.  I don't know how it is, but\r\n",
      "people like to be private when they are sleeping.  And when it comes\r\n",
      "to sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange\r\n",
      "town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections\r\n",
      "indefinitely multiply.  Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a\r\n",
      "sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors\r\n",
      "no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore.  To\r\n",
      "be sure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your\r\n",
      "own hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in\r\n",
      "your own skin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the\r\n",
      "thought of sleeping with him.  It was fair to presume that being a\r\n",
      "harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be\r\n",
      "of the tidiest, certainly none of the finest.  I began to twitch all\r\n",
      "over.  Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought\r\n",
      "to be home and going bedwards.  Suppose now, he should tumble in upon\r\n",
      "me at midnight--how could I tell from what vile hole he had been\r\n",
      "coming?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Landlord!  I've changed my mind about that harpooneer.--I shan't\r\n",
      "sleep with him.  I'll try the bench here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Just as you please; I'm sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a\r\n",
      "mattress, and it's a plaguy rough board here\"--feeling of the knots\r\n",
      "and notches.  \"But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I've got a carpenter's\r\n",
      "plane there in the bar--wait, I say, and I'll make ye snug enough.\"\r\n",
      "So saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief\r\n",
      "first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed,\r\n",
      "the while grinning like an ape.  The shavings flew right and left;\r\n",
      "till at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot.\r\n",
      "The landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for\r\n",
      "heaven's sake to quit--the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did\r\n",
      "not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a\r\n",
      "pine plank.  So gathering up the shavings with another grin, and\r\n",
      "throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went\r\n",
      "about his business, and left me in a brown study.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too\r\n",
      "short; but that could be mended with a chair.  But it was a foot too\r\n",
      "narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher\r\n",
      "than the planed one--so there was no yoking them.  I then placed the\r\n",
      "first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,\r\n",
      "leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in.\r\n",
      "But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me\r\n",
      "from under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at\r\n",
      "all, especially as another current from the rickety door met the one\r\n",
      "from the window, and both together formed a series of small\r\n",
      "whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought\r\n",
      "to spend the night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn't I\r\n",
      "steal a march on him--bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed,\r\n",
      "not to be wakened by the most violent knockings?  It seemed no bad\r\n",

      "but what the next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the\r\n",
      "harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to knock me\r\n",
      "down!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of\r\n",
      "spending a sufferable night unless in some other person's bed, I\r\n",
      "began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable\r\n",
      "prejudices against this unknown harpooneer.  Thinks I, I'll wait\r\n",
      "awhile; he must be dropping in before long.  I'll have a good look at\r\n",
      "him then, and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after\r\n",
      "all--there's no telling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and\r\n",
      "threes, and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Landlord! said I, \"what sort of a chap is he--does he always keep\r\n",
      "such late hours?\"  It was now hard upon twelve o'clock.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be\r\n",
      "mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension.  \"No,\" he\r\n",
      "answered, \"generally he's an early bird--airley to bed and airley to\r\n",
      "rise--yes, he's the bird what catches the worm.  But to-night he\r\n",
      "went out a peddling, you see, and I don't see what on airth keeps him\r\n",
      "so late, unless, may be, he can't sell his head.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "this town?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's precisely it,\" said the landlord, \"and I told him he couldn't\r\n",

      "\"With heads to be sure; ain't there too many heads in the world?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I tell you what it is, landlord,\" said I quite calmly, \"you'd better\r\n",

      "\"It's broke a'ready,\" said he.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Broke,\" said I--\"BROKE, do you mean?\"\r\n",

      "snow-storm--\"landlord, stop whittling.  You and I must understand one\r\n",
      "another, and that too without delay.  I come to your house and want a\r\n",
      "bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half\r\n",
      "belongs to a certain harpooneer.  And about this harpooneer, whom I\r\n",
      "have not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and\r\n",
      "exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling\r\n",
      "towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow--a sort of\r\n",
      "connexion, landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the\r\n",
      "highest degree.  I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and\r\n",
      "what this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe\r\n",
      "to spend the night with him.  And in the first place, you will be so\r\n",
      "good as to unsay that story about selling his head, which if true I\r\n",
      "take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I've\r\n",
      "no idea of sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, YOU I mean,\r\n",
      "landlord, YOU, sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would\r\n",
      "thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Wall,\" said the landlord, fetching a long breath, \"that's a purty\r\n",
      "long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then.  But be easy,\r\n",
      "be easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin' you of has just\r\n",
      "arrived from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of 'balmed New\r\n",
      "Zealand heads (great curios, you know), and he's sold all on 'em but\r\n",
      "one, and that one he's trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow's\r\n",
      "Sunday, and it would not do to be sellin' human heads about the\r\n",
      "streets when folks is goin' to churches.  He wanted to, last Sunday,\r\n",
      "but I stopped him just as he was goin' out of the door with four\r\n",
      "heads strung on a string, for all the airth like a string of inions.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and\r\n",
      "showed that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling\r\n",
      "me--but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who\r\n",
      "stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged\r\n",
      "in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He pays reg'lar,\" was the rejoinder.  \"But come, it's getting\r\n",
      "dreadful late, you had better be turning flukes--it's a nice bed;\r\n",
      "Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced.  There's\r\n",
      "plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed; it's an almighty\r\n",
      "big bed that.  Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and\r\n",
      "little Johnny in the foot of it.  But I got a dreaming and sprawling\r\n",
      "about one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came\r\n",
      "near breaking his arm.  Arter that, Sal said it wouldn't do.  Come\r\n",
      "along here, I'll give ye a glim in a jiffy;\" and so saying he lighted\r\n",
      "a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way.  But I\r\n",
      "stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed\r\n",
      "\"I vum it's Sunday--you won't see that harpooneer to-night; he's come\r\n",
      "to anchor somewhere--come along then; DO come; WON'T ye come?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I\r\n",
      "was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure\r\n",
      "enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four\r\n",
      "harpooneers to sleep abreast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There,\" said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea\r\n",
      "chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; \"there,\r\n",
      "make yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.\"  I turned\r\n",
      "round from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed.  Though none of\r\n",
      "the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well.  I then\r\n",
      "glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,\r\n",
      "could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude\r\n",
      "shelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man\r\n",
      "striking a whale.  Of things not properly belonging to the room,\r\n",
      "there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one\r\n",
      "corner; also a large seaman's bag, containing the harpooneer's\r\n",
      "wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk.  Likewise, there was a\r\n",
      "parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the\r\n",
      "fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But what is this on the chest?  I took it up, and held it close to\r\n",
      "the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to\r\n",
      "arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it.  I can compare\r\n",
      "it to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with\r\n",
      "little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills\r\n",
      "round an Indian moccasin.  There was a hole or slit in the middle of\r\n",
      "this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos.  But could\r\n",
      "it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat,\r\n",
      "and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise?\r\n",
      "I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being\r\n",
      "uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though\r\n",
      "this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day.  I\r\n",
      "went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never\r\n",
      "saw such a sight in my life.  I tore myself out of it in such a hurry\r\n",
      "that I gave myself a kink in the neck.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\r\n",
      "head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat.  After thinking some time\r\n",
      "on the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then\r\n",
      "stood in the middle of the room thinking.  I then took off my coat,\r\n",
      "and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves.  But beginning to feel\r\n",
      "very cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering what the\r\n",
      "landlord said about the harpooneer's not coming home at all that\r\n",
      "night, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of\r\n",
      "my pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into\r\n",
      "bed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,\r\n",
      "there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not\r\n",
      "sleep for a long time.  At last I slid off into a light doze, and had\r\n",
      "pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I\r\n",
      "heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light\r\n",
      "come into the room from under the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal\r\n",
      "head-peddler.  But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a\r\n",
      "word till spoken to.  Holding a light in one hand, and that identical\r\n",
      "New Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and\r\n",
      "without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off\r\n",
      "from me on the floor in one corner, and then began working away at\r\n",
      "the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the\r\n",
      "room.  I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted\r\n",
      "for some time while employed in unlacing the bag's mouth.  This\r\n",
      "accomplished, however, he turned round--when, good heavens! what a\r\n",
      "sight!  Such a face!  It was of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here\r\n",
      "and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares.  Yes, it's\r\n",
      "just as I thought, he's a terrible bedfellow; he's been in a fight,\r\n",
      "got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon.  But at\r\n",
      "that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I\r\n",
      "plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black\r\n",
      "squares on his cheeks.  They were stains of some sort or other.  At\r\n",
      "first I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the\r\n",
      "truth occurred to me.  I remembered a story of a white man--a\r\n",
      "whaleman too--who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by\r\n",
      "them.  I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant\r\n",
      "voyages, must have met with a similar adventure.  And what is it,\r\n",
      "thought I, after all!  It's only his outside; a man can be honest in\r\n",
      "any sort of skin.  But then, what to make of his unearthly\r\n",
      "complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and\r\n",
      "completely independent of the squares of tattooing.  To be sure, it\r\n",
      "might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never\r\n",
      "heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one.\r\n",
      "However, I had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun\r\n",
      "there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin.  Now, while\r\n",
      "all these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this\r\n",
      "harpooneer never noticed me at all.  But, after some difficulty\r\n",
      "having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently\r\n",
      "pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair\r\n",
      "on.  Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he\r\n",
      "then took the New Zealand head--a ghastly thing enough--and crammed\r\n",
      "it down into the bag.  He now took off his hat--a new beaver\r\n",
      "hat--when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.  There was no\r\n",
      "hair on his head--none to speak of at least--nothing but a small\r\n",
      "scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead.  His bald purplish head now\r\n",
      "looked for all the world like a mildewed skull.  Had not the stranger\r\n",
      "stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker\r\n",
      "than ever I bolted a dinner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window,\r\n",
      "but it was the second floor back.  I am no coward, but what to make\r\n",
      "of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my\r\n",
      "comprehension.  Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely\r\n",
      "nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as\r\n",
      "much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken\r\n",
      "into my room at the dead of night.  In fact, I was so afraid of him\r\n",
      "that I was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a\r\n",
      "satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last\r\n",
      "showed his chest and arms.  As I live, these covered parts of him\r\n",
      "were checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was\r\n",
      "all over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty\r\n",
      "Years' War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt.\r\n",
      "Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green\r\n",
      "frogs were running up the trunks of young palms.  It was now quite\r\n",
      "plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard\r\n",
      "of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian\r\n",
      "country.  I quaked to think of it.  A peddler of heads too--perhaps\r\n",
      "the heads of his own brothers.  He might take a fancy to\r\n",
      "mine--heavens! look at that tomahawk!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about\r\n",
      "something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me\r\n",
      "that he must indeed be a heathen.  Going to his heavy grego, or\r\n",
      "wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he\r\n",
      "fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a curious little\r\n",
      "deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a\r\n",
      "three days' old Congo baby.  Remembering the embalmed head, at first\r\n",
      "I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved\r\n",
      "in some similar manner.  But seeing that it was not at all limber,\r\n",
      "and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded\r\n",
      "that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to\r\n",
      "be.  For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing\r\n",
      "the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like\r\n",
      "a tenpin, between the andirons.  The chimney jambs and all the bricks\r\n",
      "inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very\r\n",
      "appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but\r\n",
      "ill at ease meantime--to see what was next to follow.  First he takes\r\n",
      "about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and\r\n",
      "places them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship\r\n",
      "biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the\r\n",
      "shavings into a sacrificial blaze.  Presently, after many hasty\r\n",
      "snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers\r\n",
      "(whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded\r\n",
      "in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a\r\n",
      "little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro.  But the\r\n",
      "little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he\r\n",
      "never moved his lips.  All these strange antics were accompanied by\r\n",
      "still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be\r\n",
      "praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other,\r\n",
      "during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.\r\n",
      "At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very\r\n",
      "unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as\r\n",
      "carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and\r\n",
      "seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business\r\n",
      "operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,\r\n",
      "now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in\r\n",
      "which I had so long been bound.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal\r\n",
      "one.  Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of\r\n",
      "it for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth\r\n",
      "at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke.  The next\r\n",
      "moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk\r\n",
      "between his teeth, sprang into bed with me.  I sang out, I could not\r\n",
      "help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began\r\n",
      "feeling me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him\r\n",
      "against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might\r\n",
      "be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again.  But\r\n",
      "his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill\r\n",
      "comprehended my meaning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Who-e debel you?\"--he at last said--\"you no speak-e, dam-me, I\r\n",
      "kill-e.\"  And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about\r\n",
      "me in the dark.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Landlord, for God's sake, Peter Coffin!\" shouted I.  \"Landlord!\r\n",
      "Watch!  Coffin!  Angels! save me!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!\" again growled\r\n",
      "the cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered\r\n",
      "the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on\r\n",
      "fire.  But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the\r\n",
      "room light in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't be afraid now,\" said he, grinning again, \"Queequeg here\r\n",
      "wouldn't harm a hair of your head.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stop your grinning,\" shouted I, \"and why didn't you tell me that\r\n",
      "that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I thought ye know'd it;--didn't I tell ye, he was a peddlin' heads\r\n",
      "around town?--but turn flukes again and go to sleep.  Queequeg, look\r\n",
      "here--you sabbee me, I sabbee--you this man sleepe you--you sabbee?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Me sabbee plenty\"--grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "My sensations were strange.  Let me try to explain them.  When I was\r\n",
      "a child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell\r\n",
      "me; whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely\r\n",
      "settle.  The circumstance was this.  I had been cutting up some caper\r\n",
      "or other--I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had\r\n",
      "seen a little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who,\r\n",
      "somehow or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed\r\n",
      "supperless,--my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and\r\n",
      "packed me off to bed, though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon\r\n",
      "of the 21st June, the longest day in the year in our hemisphere.  I\r\n",
      "felt dreadfully.  But there was no help for it, so up stairs I went\r\n",
      "to my little room in the third floor, undressed myself as slowly as\r\n",
      "possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the\r\n",
      "sheets.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must\r\n",
      "elapse before I could hope for a resurrection.  Sixteen hours in bed!\r\n",

      "the streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house.  I felt\r\n",
      "worse and worse--at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in\r\n",
      "my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw\r\n",
      "myself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a\r\n",
      "good slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning\r\n",
      "me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time.  But she was the\r\n",
      "best and most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to\r\n",
      "my room.  For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great\r\n",
      "deal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest\r\n",
      "subsequent misfortunes.  At last I must have fallen into a troubled\r\n",
      "nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it--half steeped in\r\n",
      "dreams--I opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit room was now wrapped\r\n",
      "in outer darkness.  Instantly I felt a shock running through all my\r\n",
      "frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a\r\n",
      "supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.  My arm hung over the\r\n",
      "counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom,\r\n",
      "to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side.\r\n",
      "For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most\r\n",
      "awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that\r\n",
      "if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be\r\n",
      "broken.  I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from\r\n",
      "me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and\r\n",
      "for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding\r\n",
      "attempts to explain the mystery.  Nay, to this very hour, I often\r\n",
      "puzzle myself with it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\r\n",

      "to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg's pagan\r\n",

      "soberly recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only\r\n",
      "alive to the comical predicament.  For though I tried to move his\r\n",
      "arm--unlock his bridegroom clasp--yet, sleeping as he was, he still\r\n",
      "hugged me tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain.\r\n",
      "I now strove to rouse him--\"Queequeg!\"--but his only answer was a\r\n",
      "snore.  I then rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a\r\n",
      "horse-collar; and suddenly felt a slight scratch.  Throwing aside the\r\n",
      "counterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage's side, as\r\n",
      "if it were a hatchet-faced baby.  A pretty pickle, truly, thought I;\r\n",
      "abed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a\r\n",

      "length, by dint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant\r\n",
      "expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male\r\n",
      "in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in extracting a grunt;\r\n",
      "and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all over like a\r\n",
      "Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a\r\n",
      "pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not\r\n",
      "altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim\r\n",
      "consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning\r\n",
      "over him.  Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious\r\n",
      "misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a\r\n",
      "creature.  When, at last, his mind seemed made up touching the\r\n",
      "character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it were, reconciled to\r\n",
      "the fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain signs and\r\n",
      "sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would dress\r\n",
      "first and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole\r\n",
      "apartment to myself.  Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances,\r\n",
      "this is a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages\r\n",
      "have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous\r\n",
      "how essentially polite they are.  I pay this particular compliment to\r\n",
      "Queequeg, because he treated me with so much civility and\r\n",
      "consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness; staring at him\r\n",
      "from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for the time my\r\n",
      "curiosity getting the better of my breeding.  Nevertheless, a man\r\n",
      "like Queequeg you don't see every day, he and his ways were well\r\n",
      "worth unusual regarding.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall\r\n",
      "one, by the by, and then--still minus his trowsers--he hunted up his\r\n",
      "boots.  What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his\r\n",
      "next movement was to crush himself--boots in hand, and hat on--under\r\n",
      "the bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I\r\n",
      "inferred he was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of\r\n",
      "propriety that I ever heard of, is any man required to be private\r\n",
      "when putting on his boots.  But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature\r\n",
      "in the transition stage--neither caterpillar nor butterfly.  He was\r\n",
      "just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest\r\n",
      "possible manners.  His education was not yet completed.  He was an\r\n",
      "undergraduate.  If he had not been a small degree civilized, he very\r\n",
      "probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all; but then,\r\n",
      "if he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt of\r\n",
      "getting under the bed to put them on.  At last, he emerged with his\r\n",
      "hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began\r\n",
      "creaking and limping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed\r\n",
      "to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones--probably not made\r\n",
      "to order either--rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off\r\n",
      "of a bitter cold morning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the\r\n",
      "street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view\r\n",
      "into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that\r\n",
      "Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots\r\n",
      "on; I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet\r\n",
      "somewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as\r\n",
      "possible.  He complied, and then proceeded to wash himself.  At that\r\n",
      "time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face; but\r\n",
      "Queequeg, to my amazement, contented himself with restricting his\r\n",
      "ablutions to his chest, arms, and hands.  He then donned his\r\n",
      "waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash-stand\r\n",
      "centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face.\r\n",

      "takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden\r\n",
      "stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and\r\n",
      "striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous\r\n",
      "scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.  Thinks I, Queequeg,\r\n",
      "this is using Rogers's best cutlery with a vengeance.  Afterwards I\r\n",
      "wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine\r\n",
      "steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the\r\n",
      "long straight edges are always kept.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out\r\n",

      "gleams of a newly developing bloom--the spring verdure peeping forth\r\n",
      "even beneath February's snow.  No one having previously heard his\r\n",
      "history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the\r\n",
      "utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical\r\n",
      "peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life\r\n",
      "he had led.  When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella,\r\n",
      "and certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran\r\n",
      "down with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed\r\n",
      "almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had\r\n",
      "absorbed.  However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one\r\n",
      "removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner; when,\r\n",
      "arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a\r\n",
      "regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the\r\n",
      "floor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the\r\n",
      "architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and\r\n",
      "finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular\r\n",
      "side ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea.\r\n",
      "The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome\r\n",
      "pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself\r\n",
      "nicely headed, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole\r\n",
      "contrivance, considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no\r\n",
      "means in bad taste.  Halting for an instant at the foot of the\r\n",
      "ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the\r\n",
      "man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly\r\n",
      "sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted\r\n",
      "the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case\r\n",
      "with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were\r\n",
      "of wood, so that at every step there was a joint.  At my first\r\n",
      "glimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient\r\n",
      "for a ship, these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary.\r\n",
      "For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height,\r\n",
      "slowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up\r\n",
      "the ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving\r\n",
      "him impregnable in his little Quebec.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.\r\n",
      "Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and\r\n",
      "sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any\r\n",
      "mere tricks of the stage.  No, thought I, there must be some sober\r\n",
      "reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something\r\n",
      "unseen.  Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he\r\n",
      "signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward\r\n",
      "worldly ties and connexions?  Yes, for replenished with the meat and\r\n",
      "wine of the word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is\r\n",
      "a self-containing stronghold--a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a\r\n",
      "perennial well of water within the walls.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,\r\n",
      "borrowed from the chaplain's former sea-farings.  Between the marble\r\n",
      "cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its\r\n",
      "back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship\r\n",
      "beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and\r\n",
      "snowy breakers.  But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling\r\n",
      "clouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed\r\n",
      "forth an angel's face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of\r\n",
      "radiance upon the ship's tossed deck, something like that silver\r\n",
      "plate now inserted into the Victory's plank where Nelson fell.  \"Ah,\r\n",

      "Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that\r\n",
      "had achieved the ladder and the picture.  Its panelled front was in\r\n",
      "the likeness of a ship's bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a\r\n",
      "projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship's\r\n",

      "been no other city than the modern Cadiz.  That's the opinion of\r\n",
      "learned men.  And where is Cadiz, shipmates?  Cadiz is in Spain; as\r\n",
      "far by water, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in\r\n",
      "those ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea.\r\n",

      "and worthy of all scorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking\r\n",
      "from his God; prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar\r\n",
      "hastening to cross the seas.  So disordered, self-condemning is his\r\n",
      "look, that had there been policemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere\r\n",
      "suspicion of something wrong, had been arrested ere he touched a\r\n",
      "deck.  How plainly he's a fugitive! no baggage, not a hat-box,\r\n",
      "valise, or carpet-bag,--no friends accompany him to the wharf with\r\n",
      "their adieux.  At last, after much dodging search, he finds the\r\n",

      "confidence; in vain essays his wretched smile.  Strong intuitions of\r\n",
      "the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent.  In their gamesome\r\n",
      "but still serious way, one whispers to the other--\"Jack, he's robbed\r\n",
      "a widow;\" or, \"Joe, do you mark him; he's a bigamist;\" or, \"Harry\r\n",
      "lad, I guess he's the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or\r\n",

      "sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their\r\n",
      "hands upon him.  Frighted Jonah trembles, and summoning all his\r\n",
      "boldness to his face, only looks so much the more a coward.  He will\r\n",
      "not confess himself suspected; but that itself is strong suspicion.\r\n",
      "So he makes the best of it; and when the sailors find him not to be\r\n",

      "again.  But he rallies.  'I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish;\r\n",
      "how soon sail ye, sir?'  Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up\r\n",
      "to Jonah, though the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he\r\n",
      "hear that hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance.  'We\r\n",

      "man that goes a passenger.'  Ha!  Jonah, that's another stab.  But he\r\n",
      "swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent.  'I'll sail with\r\n",
      "ye,'--he says,--'the passage money how much is that?--I'll pay now.'\r\n",
      "For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it were a thing not\r\n",
      "to be overlooked in this history, 'that he paid the fare thereof' ere\r\n",
      "the craft did sail.  And taken with the context, this is full of\r\n",
      "meaning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now Jonah's Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects\r\n",
      "crime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless.\r\n",
      "In this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely,\r\n",
      "and without a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at\r\n",
      "all frontiers.  So Jonah's Captain prepares to test the length of\r\n",
      "Jonah's purse, ere he judge him openly.  He charges him thrice the\r\n",
      "usual sum; and it's assented to.  Then the Captain knows that Jonah\r\n",
      "is a fugitive; but at the same time resolves to help a flight that\r\n",
      "paves its rear with gold.  Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse,\r\n",
      "prudent suspicions still molest the Captain.  He rings every coin to\r\n",
      "find a counterfeit.  Not a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is\r\n",
      "put down for his passage.  'Point out my state-room, Sir,' says Jonah\r\n",
      "now, 'I'm travel-weary; I need sleep.'  'Thou lookest like it,' says\r\n",
      "the Captain, 'there's thy room.'  Jonah enters, and would lock the\r\n",
      "door, but the lock contains no key.  Hearing him foolishly fumbling\r\n",
      "there, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something\r\n",
      "about the doors of convicts' cells being never allowed to be locked\r\n",
      "within.  All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into\r\n",
      "his berth, and finds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on\r\n",
      "his forehead.  The air is close, and Jonah gasps.  Then, in that\r\n",
      "contracted hole, sunk, too, beneath the ship's water-line, Jonah\r\n",
      "feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour, when the\r\n",

      "with reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight\r\n",
      "itself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it\r\n",

      "fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance.  But that\r\n",

      "is still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth\r\n",
      "water behind.  He goes down in the whirling heart of such a\r\n",
      "masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops\r\n",
      "seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to\r\n",
      "all his ivory teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison.  Then\r\n",

      "faithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for\r\n",

      "shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale.\r\n",
      "Shipmates, I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin\r\n",

      "escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa.  But God is\r\n",
      "everywhere; Tarshish he never reached.  As we have seen, God came\r\n",
      "upon him in the whale, and swallowed him down to living gulfs of\r\n",
      "doom, and with swift slantings tore him along 'into the midst of the\r\n",

      "shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale came breeching up\r\n",
      "towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the delights of air and\r\n",

      "like two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring of the\r\n",
      "ocean--Jonah did the Almighty's bidding.  And what was that,\r\n",

      "them stay.  He then went about his evening prayers, took out his\r\n",
      "idol, and removed the paper fireboard.  By certain signs and\r\n",
      "symptoms, I thought he seemed anxious for me to join him; but well\r\n",
      "knowing what was to follow, I deliberated a moment whether, in case\r\n",

      "miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the\r\n",

      "landed with bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain\r\n",
      "to mind his own eye.  The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had\r\n",
      "parted the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from\r\n",
      "side to side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck.\r\n",
      "The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept\r\n",
      "overboard; all hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the\r\n",
      "boom to stay it, seemed madness.  It flew from right to left, and\r\n",
      "back again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant\r\n",
      "seemed on the point of snapping into splinters.  Nothing was done,\r\n",
      "and nothing seemed capable of being done; those on deck rushed\r\n",
      "towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower\r\n",
      "jaw of an exasperated whale.  In the midst of this consternation,\r\n",
      "Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under the path of\r\n",
      "the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks,\r\n",
      "and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the boom as\r\n",
      "it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that way\r\n",
      "trapped, and all was safe.  The schooner was run into the wind, and\r\n",
      "while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped\r\n",
      "to the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap.\r\n",
      "For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing\r\n",
      "his long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his\r\n",
      "brawny shoulders through the freezing foam.  I looked at the grand\r\n",
      "and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.  The greenhorn had\r\n",
      "gone down.  Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water,\r\n",
      "Queequeg, now took an instant's glance around him, and seeming to see\r\n",
      "just how matters were, dived down and disappeared.  A few minutes\r\n",
      "more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the\r\n",
      "other dragging a lifeless form.  The boat soon picked them up.  The\r\n",
      "poor bumpkin was restored.  All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump;\r\n",
      "the captain begged his pardon.  From that hour I clove to Queequeg\r\n",

      "Was there ever such unconsciousness?  He did not seem to think that\r\n",
      "he at all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies.\r\n",
      "He only asked for water--fresh water--something to wipe the brine\r\n",
      "off; that done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning\r\n",
      "against the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to\r\n",

      "no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had\r\n",
      "been diligently consulting Yojo--the name of his black little\r\n",
      "god--and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly\r\n",
      "insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among\r\n",
      "the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft;\r\n",
      "instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of\r\n",
      "the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed\r\n",
      "befriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a\r\n",
      "vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light\r\n",
      "upon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in\r\n",
      "that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present\r\n",
      "irrespective of Queequeg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed\r\n",
      "great confidence in the excellence of Yojo's judgment and surprising\r\n",
      "forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a\r\n",
      "rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the\r\n",
      "whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, this plan of Queequeg's, or rather Yojo's, touching the\r\n",
      "selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all.  I had not a\r\n",
      "little relied upon Queequeg's sagacity to point out the whaler best\r\n",
      "fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely.  But as all my\r\n",
      "remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to\r\n",
      "acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a\r\n",
      "determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly\r\n",
      "settle that trifling little affair.  Next morning early, leaving\r\n",
      "Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom--for it seemed that\r\n",
      "it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation,\r\n",
      "and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; HOW it was I never could\r\n",

      "then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his\r\n",
      "sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping.\r\n",
      "After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt\r\n",
      "that there were three ships up for three-years' voyages--The\r\n",
      "Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod.  DEVIL-DAM, I do not know\r\n",
      "the origin of; TIT-BIT is obvious; PEQUOD, you will no doubt\r\n",
      "remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts\r\n",
      "Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes.  I peered and pryed about\r\n",
      "the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally,\r\n",
      "going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then\r\n",
      "decided that this was the very ship for us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I\r\n",
      "know;--square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box\r\n",
      "galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a\r\n",
      "rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod.  She was a ship of the\r\n",
      "old school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned\r\n",
      "claw-footed look about her.  Long seasoned and weather-stained in the\r\n",
      "typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull's complexion was\r\n",
      "darkened like a French grenadier's, who has alike fought in Egypt and\r\n",
      "Siberia.  Her venerable bows looked bearded.  Her masts--cut\r\n",
      "somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost\r\n",
      "overboard in a gale--her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of\r\n",
      "the three old kings of Cologne.  Her ancient decks were worn and\r\n",
      "wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury\r\n",
      "Cathedral where Becket bled.  But to all these her old antiquities,\r\n",
      "were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild\r\n",
      "business that for more than half a century she had followed.  Old\r\n",
      "Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded another\r\n",
      "vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal\r\n",
      "owners of the Pequod,--this old Peleg, during the term of his\r\n",
      "chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid\r\n",
      "it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device,\r\n",
      "unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake's carved buckler or\r\n",
      "bedstead.  She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor,\r\n",
      "his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory.  She was a thing of\r\n",
      "trophies.  A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the\r\n",
      "chased bones of her enemies.  All round, her unpanelled, open\r\n",
      "bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp\r\n",
      "teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old\r\n",
      "hempen thews and tendons to.  Those thews ran not through base blocks\r\n",
      "of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory.\r\n",
      "Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a\r\n",
      "tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the\r\n",
      "long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe.  The helmsman who\r\n",
      "steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he\r\n",
      "holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw.  A noble craft, but\r\n",
      "somehow a most melancholy!  All noble things are touched with that.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having\r\n",
      "authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage,\r\n",
      "at first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort\r\n",
      "of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast.  It\r\n",
      "seemed only a temporary erection used in port.  It was of a conical\r\n",
      "shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of\r\n",
      "limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws\r\n",
      "of the right-whale.  Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a\r\n",
      "circle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each\r\n",
      "other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose\r\n",
      "hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old\r\n",
      "Pottowottamie Sachem's head.  A triangular opening faced towards the\r\n",
      "bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view\r\n",
      "forward.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who\r\n",
      "by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and\r\n",
      "the ship's work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden\r\n",
      "of command.  He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling\r\n",
      "all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of\r\n",
      "a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was\r\n",
      "constructed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance\r\n",
      "of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old\r\n",
      "seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker\r\n",
      "style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the\r\n",
      "minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen\r\n",
      "from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to\r\n",
      "windward;--for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become\r\n",
      "pursed together.  Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is this the Captain of the Pequod?\" said I, advancing to the door of\r\n",

      "\"Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn.  I've been\r\n",
      "several voyages in the merchant service, and I think that--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Merchant service be damned.  Talk not that lingo to me.  Dost see\r\n",

      "fitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including\r\n",

      "thou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can\r\n",
      "put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Lost by a whale!  Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I do, sir.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very good.  Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to\r\n",
      "be got rid of, that is; which I don't take to be the fact.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good again.  Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to\r\n",
      "find out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in\r\n",
      "order to see the world?  Was not that what ye said?  I thought so.\r\n",
      "Well then, just step forward there, and take a peep over the\r\n",
      "weather-bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see there.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not\r\n",
      "knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest.\r\n",
      "But concentrating all his crow's feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg\r\n",
      "started me on the errand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the\r\n",
      "ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely\r\n",
      "pointing towards the open ocean.  The prospect was unlimited, but\r\n",
      "exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that\r\n",
      "I could see.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, what's the report?\" said Peleg when I came back; \"what did ye\r\n",
      "see?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not much,\" I replied--\"nothing but water; considerable horizon\r\n",
      "though, and there's a squall coming up, I think.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world?  Do ye wish to\r\n",
      "go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh?  Can't ye see the world\r\n",
      "where you stand?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and\r\n",
      "the Pequod was as good a ship as any--I thought the best--and all\r\n",
      "this I now repeated to Peleg.  Seeing me so determined, he expressed\r\n",
      "his willingness to ship me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,\" he added--\"come\r\n",
      "along with ye.\"  And so saying, he led the way below deck into the\r\n",
      "cabin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and\r\n",
      "surprising figure.  It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along\r\n",
      "with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the\r\n",
      "other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by\r\n",
      "a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery\r\n",
      "wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of\r\n",
      "plank, or a nail or two in the ship.  People in Nantucket invest\r\n",
      "their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in\r\n",
      "approved state stocks bringing in good interest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a\r\n",
      "Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and\r\n",
      "to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure\r\n",
      "the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously\r\n",
      "modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous.  For some of\r\n",
      "these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and\r\n",
      "whale-hunters.  They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a\r\n",
      "vengeance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with\r\n",
      "Scripture names--a singularly common fashion on the island--and in\r\n",
      "childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of\r\n",
      "the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless\r\n",
      "adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these\r\n",
      "unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not\r\n",
      "unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman.  And\r\n",
      "when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force,\r\n",
      "with a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the\r\n",
      "stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest\r\n",
      "waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been\r\n",
      "led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all\r\n",
      "nature's sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin\r\n",
      "voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some\r\n",
      "help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty\r\n",
      "language--that man makes one in a whole nation's census--a mighty\r\n",
      "pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies.  Nor will it at all\r\n",
      "detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other\r\n",
      "circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness\r\n",
      "at the bottom of his nature.  For all men tragically great are made\r\n",
      "so through a certain morbidness.  Be sure of this, O young ambition,\r\n",
      "all mortal greatness is but disease.  But, as yet we have not to do\r\n",
      "with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if\r\n",
      "indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the\r\n",
      "Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired\r\n",
      "whaleman.  But unlike Captain Peleg--who cared not a rush for what\r\n",
      "are called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious\r\n",
      "things the veriest of all trifles--Captain Bildad had not only been\r\n",
      "originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket\r\n",
      "Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many\r\n",
      "unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn--all that had not\r\n",
      "moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as\r\n",
      "altered one angle of his vest.  Still, for all this immutableness,\r\n",
      "was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain\r\n",
      "Peleg.  Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms\r\n",
      "against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the\r\n",
      "Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet\r\n",
      "had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of\r\n",
      "leviathan gore.  How now in the contemplative evening of his days,\r\n",
      "the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do\r\n",
      "not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably\r\n",
      "he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a\r\n",
      "man's religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another.\r\n",
      "This world pays dividends.  Rising from a little cabin-boy in short\r\n",
      "clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied\r\n",
      "waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain,\r\n",
      "and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded\r\n",
      "his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the\r\n",
      "goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet\r\n",
      "receiving of his well-earned income.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an\r\n",
      "incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard\r\n",
      "task-master.  They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a\r\n",
      "curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his\r\n",
      "crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the\r\n",
      "hospital, sore exhausted and worn out.  For a pious man, especially\r\n",
      "for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the\r\n",
      "least.  He never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but\r\n",
      "somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work\r\n",
      "out of them.  When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured\r\n",
      "eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till\r\n",
      "you could clutch something--a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to\r\n",
      "work like mad, at something or other, never mind what.  Indolence and\r\n",
      "idleness perished before him.  His own person was the exact\r\n",
      "embodiment of his utilitarian character.  On his long, gaunt body, he\r\n",
      "carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft,\r\n",
      "economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I\r\n",
      "followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin.  The space between the\r\n",
      "decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always\r\n",
      "sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails.  His\r\n",
      "broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his\r\n",
      "drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he\r\n",
      "seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Bildad,\" cried Captain Peleg, \"at it again, Bildad, eh?  Ye have\r\n",
      "been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my\r\n",
      "certain knowledge.  How far ye got, Bildad?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,\r\n",
      "Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,\r\n",
      "and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He says he's our man, Bildad,\" said Peleg, \"he wants to ship.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dost thee?\" said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I dost,\" said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do ye think of him, Bildad?\" said Peleg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He'll do,\" said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at\r\n",
      "his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as\r\n",
      "Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer.  But I\r\n",
      "said nothing, only looking round me sharply.  Peleg now threw open a\r\n",
      "chest, and drawing forth the ship's articles, placed pen and ink\r\n",
      "before him, and seated himself at a little table.  I began to think\r\n",
      "it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be\r\n",
      "willing to engage for the voyage.  I was already aware that in the\r\n",
      "whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the\r\n",
      "captain, received certain shares of the profits called lays, and that\r\n",
      "these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining\r\n",
      "to the respective duties of the ship's company.  I was also aware\r\n",
      "that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very\r\n",
      "large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a\r\n",
      "ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I\r\n",
      "had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay--that is, the\r\n",
      "275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that\r\n",
      "might eventually amount to.  And though the 275th lay was what they\r\n",
      "call a rather LONG LAY, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had\r\n",
      "a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear\r\n",
      "out on it, not to speak of my three years' beef and board, for which\r\n",
      "I would not have to pay one stiver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely\r\n",
      "fortune--and so it was, a very poor way indeed.  But I am one of\r\n",
      "those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite\r\n",
      "content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am\r\n",
      "putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud.  Upon the whole, I\r\n",
      "thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not\r\n",
      "have been surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was\r\n",
      "of a broad-shouldered make.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about\r\n",
      "receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had\r\n",
      "heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony\r\n",
      "Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod,\r\n",
      "therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners,\r\n",
      "left nearly the whole management of the ship's affairs to these two.\r\n",
      "And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty\r\n",
      "deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on\r\n",
      "board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his\r\n",
      "Bible as if at his own fireside.  Now while Peleg was vainly trying\r\n",
      "to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small\r\n",
      "surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these\r\n",
      "proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself\r\n",
      "out of his book, \"LAY not up for yourselves treasures upon earth,\r\n",
      "where moth--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, Captain Bildad,\" interrupted Peleg, \"what d'ye say, what lay\r\n",
      "shall we give this young man?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thou knowest best,\" was the sepulchral reply, \"the seven hundred and\r\n",
      "seventy-seventh wouldn't be too much, would it?--'where moth and rust\r\n",
      "do corrupt, but LAY--'\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "LAY, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and\r\n",
      "seventy-seventh!  Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for\r\n",
      "one, shall not LAY up many LAYS here below, where moth and rust do\r\n",
      "corrupt.  It was an exceedingly LONG LAY that, indeed; and though\r\n",
      "from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a\r\n",
      "landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven\r\n",
      "hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you\r\n",
      "come to make a TEENTH of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven\r\n",
      "hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less\r\n",
      "than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought\r\n",
      "at the time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,\" cried Peleg, \"thou dost not want to\r\n",
      "swindle this young man! he must have more than that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,\" again said Bildad, without\r\n",
      "lifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling--\"for where your treasure\r\n",
      "is, there will your heart be also.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,\" said Peleg, \"do\r\n",
      "ye hear that, Bildad!  The three hundredth lay, I say.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,\r\n",
      "\"Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider\r\n",
      "the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship--widows and\r\n",
      "orphans, many of them--and that if we too abundantly reward the\r\n",
      "labors of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those\r\n",
      "widows and those orphans.  The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay,\r\n",
      "Captain Peleg.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thou Bildad!\" roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the\r\n",
      "cabin.  \"Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in\r\n",
      "these matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that\r\n",
      "would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed\r\n",
      "round Cape Horn.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Captain Peleg,\" said Bildad steadily, \"thy conscience may be drawing\r\n",
      "ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can't tell; but as thou art\r\n",
      "still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy\r\n",
      "conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee\r\n",
      "foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing,\r\n",
      "ye insult me.  It's an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature\r\n",
      "that he's bound to hell.  Flukes and flames!  Bildad, say that again\r\n",
      "to me, and start my soul-bolts, but I'll--I'll--yes, I'll swallow a\r\n",
      "live goat with all his hair and horns on.  Out of the cabin, ye\r\n",
      "canting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun--a straight wake with ye!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a\r\n",
      "marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and\r\n",
      "responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up\r\n",
      "all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily\r\n",
      "commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad,\r\n",
      "who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the\r\n",
      "awakened wrath of Peleg.  But to my astonishment, he sat down again\r\n",
      "on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest\r\n",
      "intention of withdrawing.  He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg\r\n",
      "and his ways.  As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had,\r\n",
      "there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb,\r\n",
      "though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated.  \"Whew!\"\r\n",
      "he whistled at last--\"the squall's gone off to leeward, I think.\r\n",
      "Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen,\r\n",
      "will ye.  My jack-knife here needs the grindstone.  That's he; thank\r\n",
      "ye, Bildad.  Now then, my young man, Ishmael's thy name, didn't ye\r\n",
      "say?  Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth\r\n",
      "lay.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Captain Peleg,\" said I, \"I have a friend with me who wants to ship\r\n",
      "too--shall I bring him down to-morrow?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To be sure,\" said Peleg.  \"Fetch him along, and we'll look at him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What lay does he want?\" groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book\r\n",
      "in which he had again been burying himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,\" said Peleg.  \"Has he ever\r\n",
      "whaled it any?\" turning to me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, bring him along then.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that\r\n",
      "I had done a good morning's work, and that the Pequod was the\r\n",
      "identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round\r\n",
      "the Cape.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the\r\n",
      "Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though,\r\n",
      "indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out,\r\n",
      "and receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself\r\n",
      "visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are\r\n",
      "so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief,\r\n",
      "that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of\r\n",
      "that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port,\r\n",
      "but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea.  However, it\r\n",
      "is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing\r\n",
      "yourself into his hands.  Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg,\r\n",
      "inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab?  It's all right enough;\r\n",
      "thou art shipped.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, but I should like to see him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But I don't think thou wilt be able to at present.  I don't know\r\n",
      "exactly what's the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the\r\n",
      "house; a sort of sick, and yet he don't look so.  In fact, he ain't\r\n",
      "sick; but no, he isn't well either.  Any how, young man, he won't\r\n",
      "always see me, so I don't suppose he will thee.  He's a queer man,\r\n",
      "Captain Ahab--so some think--but a good one.  Oh, thou'lt like him\r\n",
      "well enough; no fear, no fear.  He's a grand, ungodly, god-like man,\r\n",
      "Captain Ahab; doesn't speak much; but, when he does speak, then you\r\n",
      "may well listen.  Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab's above the common;\r\n",
      "Ahab's been in colleges, as well as 'mong the cannibals; been used to\r\n",
      "deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier,\r\n",
      "stranger foes than whales.  His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest\r\n",
      "that out of all our isle!  Oh! he ain't Captain Bildad; no, and he\r\n",
      "ain't Captain Peleg; HE'S AHAB, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest,\r\n",
      "was a crowned king!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Come hither to me--hither, hither,\" said Peleg, with a significance\r\n",
      "in his eye that almost startled me.  \"Look ye, lad; never say that on\r\n",
      "board the Pequod.  Never say it anywhere.  Captain Ahab did not name\r\n",
      "himself.  'Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed\r\n",
      "mother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old.  And yet the old\r\n",
      "squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove\r\n",
      "prophetic.  And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the\r\n",
      "same.  I wish to warn thee.  It's a lie.  I know Captain Ahab well;\r\n",
      "I've sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is--a good\r\n",
      "man--not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good\r\n",
      "man--something like me--only there's a good deal more of him.  Aye,\r\n",
      "aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the\r\n",
      "passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was\r\n",
      "the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that\r\n",
      "about, as any one might see.  I know, too, that ever since he lost\r\n",
      "his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he's been a kind of\r\n",
      "moody--desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass\r\n",
      "off.  And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man,\r\n",
      "it's better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad\r\n",
      "one.  So good-bye to thee--and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he\r\n",
      "happens to have a wicked name.  Besides, my boy, he has a wife--not\r\n",
      "three voyages wedded--a sweet, resigned girl.  Think of that; by that\r\n",
      "sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been\r\n",
      "incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain\r\n",

      "time, I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don't know\r\n",

      "still as before.  I began to grow alarmed.  I had allowed him such\r\n",
      "abundant time; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit.  I\r\n",
      "looked through the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner\r\n",
      "of the room, the key-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister\r\n",
      "one.  I could only see part of the foot-board of the bed and a line\r\n",
      "of the wall, but nothing more.  I was surprised to behold resting\r\n",
      "against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg's harpoon, which the\r\n",
      "landlady the evening previous had taken from him, before our mounting\r\n",
      "to the chamber.  That's strange, thought I; but at any rate, since\r\n",
      "the harpoon stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad without\r\n",
      "it, therefore he must be inside here, and no possible mistake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Queequeg!--Queequeg!\"--all still.  Something must have happened.\r\n",
      "Apoplexy!  I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly\r\n",
      "resisted.  Running down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the\r\n",
      "first person I met--the chamber-maid.  \"La! la!\" she cried, \"I\r\n",
      "thought something must be the matter.  I went to make the bed after\r\n",
      "breakfast, and the door was locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and\r\n",
      "it's been just so silent ever since.  But I thought, may be, you had\r\n",
      "both gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping.  La! la,\r\n",
      "ma'am!--Mistress! murder!  Mrs. Hussey! apoplexy!\"--and with these\r\n",
      "cries, she ran towards the kitchen, I following.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a\r\n",
      "vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the\r\n",
      "occupation of attending to the castors, and scolding her little black\r\n",
      "boy meantime.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Wood-house!\" cried I, \"which way to it?  Run for God's sake, and\r\n",
      "fetch something to pry open the door--the axe!--the axe! he's had a\r\n",
      "stroke; depend upon it!\"--and so saying I was unmethodically rushing\r\n",
      "up stairs again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the\r\n",
      "mustard-pot and vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her\r\n",
      "countenance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What's the matter with you, young man?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Get the axe!  For God's sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I\r\n",
      "pry it open!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Look here,\" said the landlady, quickly putting down the\r\n",
      "vinegar-cruet, so as to have one hand free; \"look here; are you\r\n",
      "talking about prying open any of my doors?\"--and with that she seized\r\n",
      "my arm.  \"What's the matter with you?  What's the matter with you,\r\n",
      "shipmate?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand\r\n",
      "the whole case.  Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side\r\n",
      "of her nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed--\"No!  I\r\n",
      "haven't seen it since I put it there.\"  Running to a little closet\r\n",
      "under the landing of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told\r\n",
      "me that Queequeg's harpoon was missing.  \"He's killed himself,\" she\r\n",
      "cried.  \"It's unfort'nate Stiggs done over again there goes another\r\n",
      "counterpane--God pity his poor mother!--it will be the ruin of my\r\n",
      "house.  Has the poor lad a sister?  Where's that girl?--there, Betty,\r\n",
      "go to Snarles the Painter, and tell him to paint me a sign, with--\"no\r\n",
      "suicides permitted here, and no smoking in the parlor;\"--might as\r\n",
      "well kill both birds at once.  Kill?  The Lord be merciful to his\r\n",
      "ghost!  What's that noise there?  You, young man, avast there!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force\r\n",
      "open the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't allow it; I won't have my premises spoiled.  Go for the\r\n",
      "locksmith, there's one about a mile from here.  But avast!\" putting\r\n",
      "her hand in her side-pocket, \"here's a key that'll fit, I guess;\r\n",
      "let's see.\"  And with that, she turned it in the lock; but, alas!\r\n",
      "Queequeg's supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Have to burst it open,\" said I, and was running down the entry a\r\n",
      "little, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again\r\n",
      "vowing I should not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and\r\n",
      "with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming\r\n",
      "against the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good\r\n",
      "heavens! there sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected;\r\n",
      "right in the middle of the room; squatting on his hams, and holding\r\n",
      "Yojo on top of his head.  He looked neither one way nor the other\r\n",
      "way, but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Queequeg,\" said I, going up to him, \"Queequeg, what's the matter\r\n",
      "with you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He hain't been a sittin' so all day, has he?\" said the landlady.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt\r\n",
      "like pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was\r\n",
      "almost intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally\r\n",
      "constrained; especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so\r\n",
      "for upwards of eight or ten hours, going too without his regular\r\n",
      "meals.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mrs. Hussey,\" said I, \"he's ALIVE at all events; so leave us, if you\r\n",
      "please, and I will see to this strange affair myself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon\r\n",
      "Queequeg to take a chair; but in vain.  There he sat; and all he\r\n",
      "could do--for all my polite arts and blandishments--he would not move\r\n",
      "a peg, nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan;\r\n",
      "do they fast on their hams that way in his native island.  It must be\r\n",
      "so; yes, it's part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him\r\n",
      "rest; he'll get up sooner or later, no doubt.  It can't last for\r\n",
      "ever, thank God, and his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don't\r\n",
      "believe it's very punctual then.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I went down to supper.  After sitting a long time listening to the\r\n",
      "long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding\r\n",
      "voyage, as they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a\r\n",
      "schooner or brig, confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic\r\n",
      "Ocean only); after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly\r\n",
      "eleven o'clock, I went up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by\r\n",
      "this time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a\r\n",
      "termination.  But no; there he was just where I had left him; he had\r\n",
      "not stirred an inch.  I began to grow vexed with him; it seemed so\r\n",
      "downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half\r\n",
      "the night on his hams in a cold room, holding a piece of wood on his\r\n",
      "head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For heaven's sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and\r\n",
      "have some supper.  You'll starve; you'll kill yourself, Queequeg.\"\r\n",
      "But not a word did he reply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep;\r\n",
      "and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me.  But previous\r\n",
      "to turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over\r\n",
      "him, as it promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but\r\n",
      "his ordinary round jacket on.  For some time, do all I would, I could\r\n",
      "not get into the faintest doze.  I had blown out the candle; and the\r\n",
      "mere thought of Queequeg--not four feet off--sitting there in that\r\n",
      "uneasy position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me\r\n",
      "really wretched.  Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room\r\n",
      "with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable\r\n",
      "Ramadan!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break\r\n",
      "of day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as\r\n",
      "if he had been screwed down to the floor.  But as soon as the first\r\n",
      "glimpse of sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating\r\n",
      "joints, but with a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay;\r\n",
      "pressed his forehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was\r\n",
      "over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person's\r\n",
      "religion, be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or\r\n",
      "insult any other person, because that other person don't believe it\r\n",
      "also.  But when a man's religion becomes really frantic; when it is a\r\n",
      "positive torment to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an\r\n",
      "uncomfortable inn to lodge in; then I think it high time to take that\r\n",
      "individual aside and argue the point with him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And just so I now did with Queequeg.  \"Queequeg,\" said I, \"get into\r\n",
      "bed now, and lie and listen to me.\"  I then went on, beginning with\r\n",
      "the rise and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to\r\n",
      "the various religions of the present time, during which time I\r\n",
      "labored to show Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and\r\n",
      "prolonged ham-squattings in cold, cheerless rooms were stark\r\n",
      "nonsense; bad for the health; useless for the soul; opposed, in\r\n",
      "short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common sense.  I told him,\r\n",
      "too, that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and\r\n",
      "sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained me, to see him now\r\n",
      "so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his.  Besides,\r\n",
      "argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit caves in;\r\n",
      "and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved.\r\n",
      "This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such\r\n",
      "melancholy notions about their hereafters.  In one word, Queequeg,\r\n",
      "said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first born on an\r\n",
      "undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated through the\r\n",
      "hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with\r\n",
      "dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it\r\n",
      "in.  He said no; only upon one memorable occasion.  It was after a\r\n",
      "great feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great\r\n",
      "battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two\r\n",
      "o'clock in the afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No more, Queequeg,\" said I, shuddering; \"that will do;\" for I knew\r\n",
      "the inferences without his further hinting them.  I had seen a sailor\r\n",
      "who had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the\r\n",
      "custom, when a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all\r\n",
      "the slain in the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one,\r\n",
      "they were placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like\r\n",
      "a pilau, with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in\r\n",
      "their mouths, were sent round with the victor's compliments to all\r\n",
      "his friends, just as though these presents were so many Christmas\r\n",
      "turkeys.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much\r\n",
      "impression upon Queequeg.  Because, in the first place, he somehow\r\n",
      "seemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered\r\n",
      "from his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more\r\n",
      "than one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,\r\n",
      "finally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true\r\n",
      "religion than I did.  He looked at me with a sort of condescending\r\n",
      "concern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that\r\n",
      "such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical\r\n",
      "pagan piety.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously\r\n",
      "hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady\r\n",
      "should not make much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out\r\n",

      "\"No,\" said Peleg, \"and he hasn't been baptized right either, or it\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Holloa!\" cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a\r\n",
      "few paces.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Never mind him,\" said I, \"Queequeg, come on.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my\r\n",
      "shoulder, said--\"Did ye see anything looking like men going towards\r\n",
      "that ship a while ago?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying,\r\n",

      "sure.\"\r\n",

      "\"Very dim, very dim,\" said Elijah.  \"Morning to ye.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and\r\n",
      "touching my shoulder again, said, \"See if you can find 'em now, will\r\n",
      "ye?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Find who?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Morning to ye! morning to ye!\" he rejoined, again moving off.  \"Oh!\r\n",
      "I was going to warn ye against--but never mind, never mind--it's all\r\n",
      "one, all in the family too;--sharp frost this morning, ain't it?\r\n",
      "Good-bye to ye.  Shan't see ye again very soon, I guess; unless it's\r\n",
      "before the Grand Jury.\"  And with these cracked words he finally\r\n",
      "departed, leaving me, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his\r\n",
      "frantic impudence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in\r\n",
      "profound quiet, not a soul moving.  The cabin entrance was locked\r\n",
      "within; the hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging.\r\n",
      "Going forward to the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle\r\n",
      "open.  Seeing a light, we went down, and found only an old rigger\r\n",
      "there, wrapped in a tattered pea-jacket.  He was thrown at whole\r\n",
      "length upon two chests, his face downwards and inclosed in his folded\r\n",
      "arms.  The profoundest slumber slept upon him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?\" said\r\n",
      "I, looking dubiously at the sleeper.  But it seemed that, when on the\r\n",
      "wharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I\r\n",
      "would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that\r\n",
      "matter, were it not for Elijah's otherwise inexplicable question.\r\n",
      "But I beat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly\r\n",
      "hinted to Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body;\r\n",
      "telling him to establish himself accordingly.  He put his hand upon\r\n",
      "the sleeper's rear, as though feeling if it was soft enough; and\r\n",
      "then, without more ado, sat quietly down there.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Gracious!  Queequeg, don't sit there,\" said I.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh! perry dood seat,\" said Queequeg, \"my country way; won't hurt\r\n",
      "him face.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Face!\" said I, \"call that his face? very benevolent countenance\r\n",
      "then; but how hard he breathes, he's heaving himself; get off,\r\n",
      "Queequeg, you are heavy, it's grinding the face of the poor.  Get\r\n",
      "off, Queequeg!  Look, he'll twitch you off soon.  I wonder he don't\r\n",
      "wake.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and\r\n",
      "lighted his tomahawk pipe.  I sat at the feet.  We kept the pipe\r\n",
      "passing over the sleeper, from one to the other.  Meanwhile, upon\r\n",
      "questioning him in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand\r\n",
      "that, in his land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all\r\n",
      "sorts, the king, chiefs, and great people generally, were in the\r\n",
      "custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans; and to\r\n",
      "furnish a house comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up\r\n",
      "eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay them round in the piers and\r\n",
      "alcoves.  Besides, it was very convenient on an excursion; much\r\n",
      "better than those garden-chairs which are convertible into\r\n",
      "walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and\r\n",
      "desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree,\r\n",
      "perhaps in some damp marshy place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the\r\n",
      "tomahawk from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the\r\n",
      "sleeper's head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What's that for, Queequeg?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,\r\n",
      "which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and\r\n",
      "soothed his soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping\r\n",
      "rigger.  The strong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole,\r\n",
      "it began to tell upon him.  He breathed with a sort of muffledness;\r\n",
      "then seemed troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice;\r\n",
      "then sat up and rubbed his eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Holloa!\" he breathed at last, \"who be ye smokers?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Shipped men,\" answered I, \"when does she sail?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye?  She sails to-day.  The\r\n",

      "we heard a noise on deck.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Holloa!  Starbuck's astir,\" said the rigger.  \"He's a lively chief\r\n",
      "mate, that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn\r\n",
      "to.\"  And so saying he went on deck, and we followed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was now clear sunrise.  Soon the crew came on board in twos and\r\n",
      "threes; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively\r\n",
      "engaged; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing\r\n",

      "How now!  Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage,\r\n",
      "Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on\r\n",
      "the quarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea,\r\n",
      "as well as to all appearances in port.  And, as for Captain Ahab, no\r\n",
      "sign of him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin.\r\n",
      "But then, the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary\r\n",
      "in getting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea.\r\n",
      "Indeed, as that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot's;\r\n",
      "and as he was not yet completely recovered--so they said--therefore,\r\n",
      "Captain Ahab stayed below.  And all this seemed natural enough;\r\n",
      "especially as in the merchant service many captains never show\r\n",
      "themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the\r\n",
      "anchor, but remain over the cabin table, having a farewell\r\n",
      "merry-making with their shore friends, before they quit the ship for\r\n",
      "good with the pilot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain\r\n",
      "Peleg was now all alive.  He seemed to do most of the talking and\r\n",
      "commanding, and not Bildad.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,\" he cried, as the sailors lingered\r\n",
      "at the main-mast.  \"Mr. Starbuck, drive'em aft.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Strike the tent there!\"--was the next order.  As I hinted before,\r\n",
      "this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board\r\n",
      "the Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well\r\n",
      "known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Man the capstan!  Blood and thunder!--jump!\"--was the next command,\r\n",
      "and the crew sprang for the handspikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the\r\n",
      "pilot is the forward part of the ship.  And here Bildad, who, with\r\n",
      "Peleg, be it known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the\r\n",
      "licensed pilots of the port--he being suspected to have got himself\r\n",
      "made a pilot in order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the\r\n",
      "ships he was concerned in, for he never piloted any other\r\n",
      "craft--Bildad, I say, might now be seen actively engaged in looking\r\n",
      "over the bows for the approaching anchor, and at intervals singing\r\n",
      "what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody, to cheer the hands at the\r\n",
      "windlass, who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in\r\n",
      "Booble Alley, with hearty good will.  Nevertheless, not three days\r\n",
      "previous, Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed\r\n",
      "on board the Pequod, particularly in getting under weigh; and\r\n",
      "Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped\r\n",

      "would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily\r\n",
      "I paused on my handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking\r\n",
      "of the perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a\r\n",
      "devil for a pilot.  I was comforting myself, however, with the\r\n",
      "thought that in pious Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of\r\n",
      "his seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp\r\n",
      "poke in my rear, and turning round, was horrified at the apparition\r\n",
      "of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate\r\n",
      "vicinity.  That was my first kick.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?\" he roared.\r\n",
      "\"Spring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone!  Why don't\r\n",
      "ye spring, I say, all of ye--spring!  Quohog! spring, thou chap with\r\n",
      "the red whiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green\r\n",
      "pants.  Spring, I say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!\"  And so\r\n",
      "saying, he moved along the windlass, here and there using his leg\r\n",
      "very freely, while imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his\r\n",
      "psalmody.  Thinks I, Captain Peleg must have been drinking something\r\n",
      "to-day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided.  It\r\n",

      "into night, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean,\r\n",
      "whose freezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor.  The long\r\n",
      "rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like\r\n",
      "the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles\r\n",
      "depended from the bows.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "the boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket,\r\n",
      "there was yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store;\r\n",

      "the spring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed no\r\n",
      "longer.  The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging\r\n",
      "alongside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected\r\n",
      "at this juncture, especially Captain Bildad.  For loath to depart,\r\n",
      "yet; very loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and\r\n",
      "perilous a voyage--beyond both stormy Capes; a ship in which some\r\n",
      "thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested; a ship, in which\r\n",
      "an old shipmate sailed as captain; a man almost as old as he, once\r\n",
      "more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw; loath\r\n",
      "to say good-bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to\r\n",
      "him,--poor old Bildad lingered long; paced the deck with anxious\r\n",
      "strides; ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word\r\n",
      "there; again came on deck, and looked to windward; looked towards the\r\n",
      "wide and endless waters, only bounded by the far-off unseen Eastern\r\n",
      "Continents; looked towards the land; looked aloft; looked right and\r\n",
      "left; looked everywhere and nowhere; and at last, mechanically\r\n",
      "coiling a rope upon its pin, convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the\r\n",
      "hand, and holding up a lantern, for a moment stood gazing heroically\r\n",
      "in his face, as much as to say, \"Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can\r\n",
      "stand it; yes, I can.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all\r\n",
      "his philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the\r\n",
      "lantern came too near.  And he, too, did not a little run from cabin\r\n",
      "to deck--now a word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief\r\n",
      "mate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look\r\n",

      "calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and induce confidence\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the\r\n",

      "when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without\r\n",
      "consuming them, or taking away one particle from their compacted aged\r\n",
      "robustness.  His whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze,\r\n",

      "Threading its way out from among his grey hairs, and continuing right\r\n",
      "down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck, till it\r\n",
      "disappeared in his clothing, you saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly\r\n",
      "whitish.  It resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the\r\n",
      "straight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when the upper lightning\r\n",
      "tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single twig, peels\r\n",
      "and grooves out the bark from top to bottom, ere running off into the\r\n",
      "soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded.  Whether\r\n",
      "that mark was born with him, or whether it was the scar left by some\r\n",
      "desperate wound, no one could certainly say.  By some tacit consent,\r\n",
      "throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it,\r\n",
      "especially by the mates.  But once Tashtego's senior, an old Gay-Head\r\n",
      "Indian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not till he was\r\n",
      "full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded, and then it\r\n",
      "came upon him, not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in an\r\n",
      "elemental strife at sea.  Yet, this wild hint seemed inferentially\r\n",
      "negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral man,\r\n",
      "who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere this\r\n",

      "immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old Manxman with\r\n",
      "preternatural powers of discernment.  So that no white sailor\r\n",
      "seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab\r\n",
      "should be tranquilly laid out--which might hardly come to pass, so he\r\n",

      "would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the\r\n",
      "livid brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I\r\n",
      "hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing\r\n",
      "to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood.  It had\r\n",
      "previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned\r\n",
      "from the polished bone of the sperm whale's jaw.  \"Aye, he was\r\n",
      "dismasted off Japan,\" said the old Gay-Head Indian once; \"but like\r\n",
      "his dismasted craft, he shipped another mast without coming home for\r\n",
      "it.  He has a quiver of 'em.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was struck with the singular posture he maintained.  Upon each side\r\n",
      "of the Pequod's quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds,\r\n",
      "there was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the\r\n",
      "plank.  His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and\r\n",
      "holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out\r\n",
      "beyond the ship's ever-pitching prow.  There was an infinity of\r\n",
      "firmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the\r\n",
      "fixed and fearless, forward dedication of that glance.  Not a word he\r\n",
      "spoke; nor did his officers say aught to him; though by all their\r\n",
      "minutest gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if\r\n",
      "not painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye.  And\r\n",
      "not only that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a\r\n",
      "crucifixion in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing\r\n",
      "dignity of some mighty woe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his\r\n",
      "cabin.  But after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew;\r\n",
      "either standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he\r\n",
      "had; or heavily walking the deck.  As the sky grew less gloomy;\r\n",
      "indeed, began to grow a little genial, he became still less and less\r\n",
      "a recluse; as if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the\r\n",
      "dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded.  And,\r\n",
      "by and by, it came to pass, that he was almost continually in the\r\n",
      "air; but, as yet, for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at\r\n",
      "last sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast.  But\r\n",
      "the Pequod was only making a passage now; not regularly cruising;\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology\r\n",
      "is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters\r\n",
      "it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish.  In his\r\n",
      "System of Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, \"I hereby separate\r\n",
      "the whales from the fish.\"  But of my own knowledge, I know that down\r\n",
      "to the year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against\r\n",
      "Linnaeus's express edict, were still found dividing the possession of\r\n",
      "the same seas with the Leviathan.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales\r\n",
      "from the waters, he states as follows: \"On account of their warm\r\n",
      "bilocular heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow\r\n",
      "ears, penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,\" and finally, \"ex\r\n",
      "lege naturae jure meritoque.\"  I submitted all this to my friends\r\n",
      "Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine\r\n",
      "in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the reasons\r\n",
      "set forth were altogether insufficient.  Charley profanely hinted\r\n",
      "they were humbug.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned\r\n",
      "ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.\r\n",
      "This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal\r\n",
      "respect does the whale differ from other fish.  Above, Linnaeus has\r\n",
      "given you those items.  But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm\r\n",
      "blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as\r\n",
      "conspicuously to label him for all time to come?  To be short, then,\r\n",
      "a whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL.  There you have\r\n",
      "him.  However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded\r\n",
      "meditation.  A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not\r\n",
      "a fish, because he is amphibious.  But the last term of the\r\n",
      "definition is still more cogent, as coupled with the first.  Almost\r\n",
      "any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have\r\n",
      "not a flat, but a vertical, or up-and-down tail.  Whereas, among\r\n",
      "spouting fish the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably\r\n",
      "assumes a horizontal position.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude\r\n",
      "from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified\r\n",
      "with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other\r\n",
      "hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as\r\n",
      "alien.*  Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish\r\n",

      "seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of\r\n",
      "Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions, which the\r\n",

      "indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any\r\n",
      "regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and\r\n",
      "more essential particulars.  Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a\r\n",
      "place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board,\r\n",
      "arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The large importance attached to the harpooneer's vocation is evinced\r\n",
      "by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries\r\n",
      "and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in\r\n",
      "the person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an\r\n",
      "officer called the Specksynder.  Literally this word means\r\n",

      "Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme.  In the British Greenland Fishery,\r\n",
      "under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is\r\n",
      "still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged.  At present\r\n",
      "he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the\r\n",
      "captain's more inferior subalterns.  Nevertheless, as upon the good\r\n",
      "conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely\r\n",
      "depends, and since in the American Fishery he is not only an\r\n",
      "important officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night\r\n",
      "watches on a whaling ground) the command of the ship's deck is also\r\n",
      "his; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he\r\n",
      "should nominally live apart from the men before the mast, and be in\r\n",
      "some way distinguished as their professional superior; though always,\r\n",
      "by them, familiarly regarded as their social equal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is\r\n",
      "this--the first lives aft, the last forward.  Hence, in whale-ships\r\n",
      "and merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the\r\n",
      "captain; and so, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers\r\n",

      "Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned\r\n",

      "still deferential cubs.  In his own proper turn, each officer waited\r\n",
      "to be served.  They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in\r\n",
      "Ahab, there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance.  With\r\n",
      "one mind, their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man's knife, as\r\n",
      "he carved the chief dish before him.  I do not suppose that for the\r\n",

      "when reaching out his knife and fork, between which the slice of beef\r\n",
      "was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck's plate towards him, the\r\n",
      "mate received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly;\r\n",
      "and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the\r\n",
      "plate; and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without\r\n",

      "the German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial\r\n",
      "Electors, so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in\r\n",
      "awful silence; and yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversation;\r\n",

      "party.  His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his would have\r\n",
      "been the drumsticks.  For Flask to have presumed to help himself,\r\n",
      "this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first\r\n",
      "degree.  Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more\r\n",
      "would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world;\r\n",
      "nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him.  And had Flask\r\n",
      "helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed\r\n",
      "it.  Least of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter.\r\n",
      "Whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on\r\n",
      "account of its clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he\r\n",
      "deemed that, on so long a voyage in such marketless waters, butter\r\n",
      "was at a premium, and therefore was not for him, a subaltern; however\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Another thing.  Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and\r\n",
      "Flask is the first man up.  Consider!  For hereby Flask's dinner was\r\n",
      "badly jammed in point of time.  Starbuck and Stubb both had the start\r\n",
      "of him; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear.\r\n",
      "If Stubb even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have\r\n",
      "but a small appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his\r\n",
      "repast, then Flask must bestir himself, he will not get more than\r\n",
      "three mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to\r\n",
      "precede Flask to the deck.  Therefore it was that Flask once admitted\r\n",
      "in private, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an\r\n",
      "officer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be\r\n",

      "inverted order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or\r\n",

      "And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with a nimble\r\n",
      "hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of\r\n",
      "accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise.  And\r\n",
      "once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy's memory\r\n",
      "by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty\r\n",
      "wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the\r\n",
      "circle preliminary to scalping him.  He was naturally a very nervous,\r\n",
      "shuddering sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the\r\n",
      "progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse.  And what with the\r\n",
      "standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the periodical\r\n",
      "tumultuous visitations of these three savages, Dough-Boy's whole life\r\n",
      "was one continual lip-quiver.  Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers\r\n",
      "furnished with all things they demanded, he would escape from their\r\n",
      "clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and fearfully peep out at\r\n",
      "them through the blinds of its door, till all was over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing\r\n",
      "his filed teeth to the Indian's: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on\r\n",
      "the floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to\r\n",
      "the low carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the\r\n",
      "low cabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes\r\n",
      "passenger in a ship.  But for all this, the great negro was\r\n",
      "wonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty.  It seemed hardly possible\r\n",
      "that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the\r\n",
      "vitality diffused through so broad, baronial, and superb a person.\r\n",
      "But, doubtless, this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the\r\n",
      "abounding element of air; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in\r\n",
      "the sublime life of the worlds.  Not by beef or by bread, are giants\r\n",
      "made or nourished.  But Queequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric smack of\r\n",
      "the lip in eating--an ugly sound enough--so much so, that the\r\n",
      "trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth\r\n",
      "lurked in his own lean arms.  And when he would hear Tashtego singing\r\n",
      "out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be picked, the\r\n",
      "simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round\r\n",
      "him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy.  Nor did the\r\n",
      "whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their\r\n",
      "lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they\r\n",
      "would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not\r\n",
      "at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy.  How could he forget that\r\n",
      "in his Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been\r\n",
      "guilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions.  Alas!  Dough-Boy!\r\n",
      "hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals.  Not a napkin\r\n",
      "should he carry on his arm, but a buckler.  In good time, though, to\r\n",
      "his great delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart;\r\n",
      "to his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones\r\n",
      "jingling in them at every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.\r\n",

      "But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived\r\n",
      "there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were\r\n",
      "scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before\r\n",

      "inwards for a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a\r\n",
      "permanent thing, residing in the open air.  Nor did they lose much\r\n",
      "hereby; in the cabin was no companionship; socially, Ahab was\r\n",
      "inaccessible.  Though nominally included in the census of\r\n",
      "Christendom, he was still an alien to it.  He lived in the world, as\r\n",
      "the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri.  And as when\r\n",
      "Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of the woods, burying\r\n",
      "himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there, sucking\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with\r\n",
      "the other seamen my first mast-head came round.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost\r\n",
      "simultaneously with the vessel's leaving her port; even though she\r\n",
      "may have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her\r\n",
      "proper cruising ground.  And if, after a three, four, or five years'\r\n",
      "voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her--say, an\r\n",
      "empty vial even--then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last;\r\n",
      "and not till her skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port,\r\n",
      "does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a\r\n",
      "very ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate\r\n",
      "here.  I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the\r\n",
      "old Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to\r\n",
      "them.  For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must\r\n",
      "doubtless, by their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest\r\n",
      "mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was\r\n",
      "put to it) as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have\r\n",
      "gone by the board, in the dread gale of God's wrath; therefore, we\r\n",
      "cannot give these Babel builders priority over the Egyptians.  And\r\n",
      "that the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers, is an\r\n",
      "assertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists, that\r\n",
      "the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes: a theory\r\n",
      "singularly supported by the peculiar stair-like formation of all four\r\n",
      "sides of those edifices; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of\r\n",
      "their legs, those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and\r\n",
      "sing out for new stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing\r\n",
      "out for a sail, or a whale just bearing in sight.  In Saint Stylites,\r\n",
      "the famous Christian hermit of old times, who built him a lofty stone\r\n",
      "pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life\r\n",
      "on its summit, hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle; in\r\n",
      "him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless\r\n",
      "stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place by\r\n",
      "fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything\r\n",
      "out to the last, literally died at his post.  Of modern\r\n",
      "standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron,\r\n",
      "and bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale,\r\n",
      "are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon\r\n",
      "discovering any strange sight.  There is Napoleon; who, upon the top\r\n",
      "of the column of Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred\r\n",
      "and fifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below;\r\n",
      "whether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil.  Great\r\n",
      "Washington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in\r\n",
      "Baltimore, and like one of Hercules' pillars, his column marks that\r\n",
      "point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go.  Admiral\r\n",
      "Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in\r\n",
      "Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke,\r\n",
      "token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is\r\n",
      "smoke, must be fire.  But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor\r\n",
      "Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked\r\n",
      "to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they\r\n",
      "gaze; however it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate\r\n",
      "through the thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what\r\n",
      "rocks must be shunned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head\r\n",
      "standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is\r\n",
      "not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole\r\n",
      "historian of Nantucket, stands accountable.  The worthy Obed tells\r\n",
      "us, that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were\r\n",
      "regularly launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island\r\n",
      "erected lofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs\r\n",
      "ascended by means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in\r\n",
      "a hen-house.  A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay\r\n",
      "whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to\r\n",
      "the ready-manned boats nigh the beach.  But this custom has now\r\n",
      "become obsolete; turn we then to the one proper mast-head, that of a\r\n",
      "whale-ship at sea.  The three mast-heads are kept manned from\r\n",
      "sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at the\r\n",
      "helm), and relieving each other every two hours.  In the serene\r\n",
      "weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head; nay,\r\n",
      "to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful.  There you stand, a\r\n",
      "hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the deep, as if\r\n",
      "the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and between your\r\n",
      "legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships\r\n",
      "once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes.\r\n",
      "There you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with nothing\r\n",
      "ruffled but the waves.  The tranced ship indolently rolls; the drowsy\r\n",
      "trade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor.  For the most\r\n",
      "part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests\r\n",
      "you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras with startling\r\n",
      "accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary\r\n",
      "excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt\r\n",
      "securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of\r\n",
      "what you shall have for dinner--for all your meals for three years\r\n",
      "and more are snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is\r\n",
      "immutable.\r\n",

      "In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years'\r\n",
      "voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at\r\n",
      "the mast-head would amount to several entire months.  And it is much\r\n",
      "to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a\r\n",
      "portion of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly\r\n",
      "destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or\r\n",
      "adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains\r\n",
      "to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or\r\n",
      "any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men\r\n",
      "temporarily isolate themselves.  Your most usual point of perch is\r\n",
      "the head of the t' gallant-mast, where you stand upon two thin\r\n",
      "parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called the t' gallant\r\n",
      "cross-trees.  Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner feels about\r\n",
      "as cosy as he would standing on a bull's horns.  To be sure, in cold\r\n",
      "weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of a\r\n",
      "watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more\r\n",
      "of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of\r\n",
      "its fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about in it, nor even\r\n",
      "move out of it, without running great risk of perishing (like an\r\n",
      "ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a watch-coat\r\n",
      "is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or additional\r\n",
      "skin encasing you.  You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in\r\n",
      "your body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of your\r\n",
      "watch-coat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of\r\n",
      "a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents\r\n",
      "or pulpits, called CROW'S-NESTS, in which the look-outs of a\r\n",
      "Greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It drew near the close of day.  Suddenly he came to a halt by the\r\n",
      "bulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and\r\n",
      "with one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send\r\n",

      "that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing\r\n",

      "More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the\r\n",
      "countenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began\r\n",
      "to gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that\r\n",

      "questions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in\r\n",
      "his pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly,\r\n",
      "almost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was\r\n",
      "slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if\r\n",
      "to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile\r\n",
      "lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and\r\n",
      "inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of\r\n",
      "his vitality in him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the\r\n",
      "main-mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold\r\n",
      "with the other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: \"Whosoever\r\n",

      "terror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to\r\n",

      "incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel\r\n",
      "eating in them, till they are left living on with half a heart and\r\n",
      "half a lung.  That intangible malignity which has been from the\r\n",
      "beginning; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe\r\n",
      "one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east\r\n",
      "reverenced in their statue devil;--Ahab did not fall down and worship\r\n",

      "in Moby Dick.  He piled upon the whale's white hump the sum of all\r\n",
      "the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and\r\n",

      "passionate, corporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that\r\n",

      "nothing more.  Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards\r\n",

      "stretched together in one hammock, rounding in mid winter that\r\n",
      "dreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his torn body and\r\n",
      "gashed soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made him mad.\r\n",

      "and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in\r\n",
      "his Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his delirium,\r\n",
      "that his mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he\r\n",
      "sailed, raving in his hammock.  In a strait-jacket, he swung to the\r\n",
      "mad rockings of the gales.  And, when running into more sufferable\r\n",
      "latitudes, the ship, with mild stun'sails spread, floated across the\r\n",
      "tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man's delirium\r\n",
      "seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn swells, and he came forth\r\n",
      "from his dark den into the blessed light and air; even then, when he\r\n",
      "bore that firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his calm\r\n",
      "orders once again; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was\r\n",
      "now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on.  Human\r\n",
      "madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.  When you\r\n",
      "think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still\r\n",
      "subtler form.  Ahab's full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly\r\n",
      "contracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows\r\n",
      "narrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge.  But, as in\r\n",
      "his narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab's broad madness had\r\n",
      "been left behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great\r\n",
      "natural intellect had perished.  That before living agent, now became\r\n",
      "the living instrument.  If such a furious trope may stand, his\r\n",
      "special lunacy stormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned\r\n",
      "all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from\r\n",
      "having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a\r\n",

      "man's upper earth, his root of grandeur, his whole awful essence sits\r\n",
      "in bearded state; an antique buried beneath antiquities, and throned\r\n",
      "on torsoes!  So with a broken throne, the great gods mock that\r\n",
      "captive king; so like a Caryatid, he patient sits, upholding on his\r\n",

      "kill, or change, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind\r\n",

      "portions of it are presented in the circular.  \"This chart divides\r\n",
      "the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees\r\n",
      "of longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are\r\n",
      "twelve columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each\r\n",

      "Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another,\r\n",

      "called; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such\r\n",
      "undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any\r\n",
      "chart, with one tithe of such marvellous precision.  Though, in these\r\n",
      "cases, the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a\r\n",
      "surveyor's parallel, and though the line of advance be strictly\r\n",
      "confined to its own unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary\r\n",
      "VEIN in which at these times he is said to swim, generally embraces\r\n",
      "some few miles in width (more or less, as the vein is presumed to\r\n",
      "expand or contract); but never exceeds the visual sweep from the\r\n",
      "whale-ship's mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along this magic\r\n",
      "zone.  The sum is, that at particular seasons within that breadth and\r\n",
      "along that path, migrating whales may with great confidence be looked\r\n",
      "for.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate\r\n",
      "feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in\r\n",
      "crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could,\r\n",

      "There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his\r\n",

      "that were found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar\r\n",
      "and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved\r\n",
      "true.  In general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit,\r\n",
      "applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm\r\n",
      "whales.  So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for\r\n",
      "example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean,\r\n",
      "or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that\r\n",
      "were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent\r\n",
      "corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there.  So,\r\n",
      "too, with some other feeding grounds, where he had at times revealed\r\n",
      "himself.  But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and\r\n",
      "ocean-inns, so to speak, not his places of prolonged abode.  And\r\n",
      "where Ahab's chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been\r\n",
      "spoken of, allusion has only been made to whatever way-side,\r\n",
      "antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a particular set time or\r\n",
      "place were attained, when all possibilities would become\r\n",
      "probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the\r\n",
      "next thing to a certainty.  That particular set time and place were\r\n",
      "conjoined in the one technical phrase--the Season-on-the-Line.  For\r\n",
      "there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been\r\n",
      "periodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the\r\n",
      "sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any one\r\n",
      "sign of the Zodiac.  There it was, too, that most of the deadly\r\n",
      "encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the waves were\r\n",
      "storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot where the\r\n",
      "monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance.  But\r\n",
      "in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with\r\n",
      "which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt, he\r\n",
      "would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning\r\n",
      "fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those hopes;\r\n",
      "nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his\r\n",
      "unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of\r\n",
      "the Season-on-the-Line.  No possible endeavor then could enable her\r\n",
      "commander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and\r\n",
      "then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial\r\n",
      "Pacific in time to cruise there.  Therefore, he must wait for the\r\n",
      "next ensuing season.  Yet the premature hour of the Pequod's sailing\r\n",
      "had, perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this\r\n",
      "very complexion of things.  Because, an interval of three hundred and\r\n",
      "sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead\r\n",
      "of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous\r\n",
      "hunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far\r\n",
      "remote from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his\r\n",
      "wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China\r\n",
      "Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race.  So that Monsoons,\r\n",
      "Pampas, Nor'-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter\r\n",
      "and Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it\r\n",
      "not but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one\r\n",
      "solitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of\r\n",
      "individual recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti\r\n",
      "in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople?  Yes.  For the\r\n",
      "peculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could\r\n",
      "not but be unmistakable.  And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab\r\n",
      "would mutter to himself, as after poring over his charts till long\r\n",
      "after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries--tallied him,\r\n",
      "and shall he escape?  His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out\r\n",
      "like a lost sheep's ear!  And here, his mad mind would run on in a\r\n",
      "breathless race; till a weariness and faintness of pondering came\r\n",
      "over him; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover\r\n",
      "his strength.  Ah, God! what trances of torments does that man endure\r\n",
      "who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire.  He sleeps\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably\r\n",
      "vivid dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts\r\n",
      "through the day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and\r\n",
      "whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain, till\r\n",
      "the very throbbing of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and\r\n",
      "when, as was sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved\r\n",
      "his being up from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from\r\n",
      "which forked flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends\r\n",
      "beckoned him to leap down among them; when this hell in himself\r\n",
      "yawned beneath him, a wild cry would be heard through the ship; and\r\n",
      "with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room, as though\r\n",
      "escaping from a bed that was on fire.  Yet these, perhaps, instead of\r\n",
      "being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright\r\n",
      "at his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity.\r\n",
      "For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast\r\n",
      "hunter of the white whale; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock,\r\n",
      "was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror\r\n",
      "again.  The latter was the eternal, living principle or soul in him;\r\n",
      "and in sleep, being for the time dissociated from the characterizing\r\n",
      "mind, which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or\r\n",
      "agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity\r\n",
      "of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no longer an\r\n",
      "integral.  But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the\r\n",
      "soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab's case, yielding up\r\n",
      "all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that\r\n",
      "purpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against\r\n",
      "gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent being of its\r\n",
      "own.  Nay, could grimly live and burn, while the common vitality to\r\n",
      "which it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and\r\n",
      "unfathered birth.  Therefore, the tormented spirit that glared out of\r\n",
      "bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room, was for the\r\n",
      "time but a vacated thing, a formless somnambulistic being, a ray of\r\n",

      "poisonous miasmas, with all the other common perils incident to\r\n",
      "wandering in the heart of unknown regions.  Meanwhile, the whale he\r\n",

      "circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the coasts of\r\n",
      "Africa; but to no purpose.  This man and this whale again came\r\n",

      "his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for\r\n",
      "however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be, they soon\r\n",

      "judiciously malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in,\r\n",
      "utterly destroy, and sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of\r\n",
      "Nantucket, was cruising in the Pacific Ocean.  One day she saw\r\n",
      "spouts, lowered her boats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales.\r\n",
      "Ere long, several of the whales were wounded; when, suddenly, a very\r\n",
      "large whale escaping from the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore\r\n",
      "directly down upon the ship.  Dashing his forehead against her hull,\r\n",
      "he so stove her in, that in less than \"ten minutes\" she settled down\r\n",
      "and fell over.  Not a surviving plank of her has been seen since.\r\n",
      "After the severest exposure, part of the crew reached the land in\r\n",
      "their boats.  Being returned home at last, Captain Pollard once more\r\n",
      "sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship, but the gods\r\n",
      "shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers; for the second\r\n",
      "time his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he\r\n",
      "has never tempted it since.  At this day Captain Pollard is a\r\n",
      "resident of Nantucket.  I have seen Owen Chace, who was chief mate of\r\n",
      "the Essex at the time of the tragedy; I have read his plain and\r\n",

      "ship, at a short interval between them, both of which, according to\r\n",
      "their direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being\r\n",
      "made ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for\r\n",
      "the shock; to effect which, the exact manoeuvres which he made were\r\n",
      "necessary.  His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated\r\n",
      "resentment and fury.  He came directly from the shoal which we had\r\n",

      "\"By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next\r\n",
      "day we were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh.  The weather\r\n",
      "was very clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged\r\n",
      "to keep on our fur clothing.  For some days we had very little wind;\r\n",
      "it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest\r\n",
      "sprang up.  An uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger\r\n",
      "than the ship itself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was\r\n",
      "not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship,\r\n",
      "which was in full sail, was almost upon him, so that it was\r\n",
      "impossible to prevent its striking against him.  We were thus placed\r\n",
      "in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature, setting up\r\n",
      "its back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the water.  The\r\n",
      "masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who were below\r\n",
      "all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck\r\n",
      "upon some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with\r\n",
      "the utmost gravity and solemnity.  Captain D'Wolf applied immediately\r\n",
      "to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any\r\n",
      "damage from the shock, but we found that very happily it had escaped\r\n",
      "entirely uninjured.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, the Captain D'Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in\r\n",
      "question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual\r\n",
      "adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of\r\n",
      "Dorchester near Boston.  I have the honour of being a nephew of his.\r\n",
      "I have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in\r\n",
      "Langsdorff.  He substantiates every word.  The ship, however, was by\r\n",
      "no means a large one: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast,\r\n",
      "and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he\r\n",
      "sailed from home.\r\n",

      "Dampier's old chums--I found a little matter set down so like that\r\n",
      "just quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here\r\n",
      "for a corroborative example, if such be needed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lionel, it seems, was on his way to \"John Ferdinando,\" as he calls\r\n",
      "the modern Juan Fernandes.  \"In our way thither,\" he says, \"about\r\n",
      "four o'clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty\r\n",
      "leagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock,\r\n",
      "which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell\r\n",
      "where they were or what to think; but every one began to prepare for\r\n",
      "death.  And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we\r\n",
      "took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the\r\n",
      "amazement was a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found\r\n",
      "no ground.  ....  The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in\r\n",
      "their carriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their\r\n",
      "hammocks.  Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was thrown\r\n",
      "out of his cabin!\"  Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an\r\n",
      "earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that\r\n",
      "a great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great\r\n",
      "mischief along the Spanish land.  But I should not much wonder if, in\r\n",
      "the darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after\r\n",
      "all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from\r\n",
      "beneath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known\r\n",
      "to me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale.  In\r\n",
      "more than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the\r\n",
      "assailing boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself,\r\n",
      "and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks.  The\r\n",
      "English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for\r\n",
      "his strength, let me say, that there have been examples where the\r\n",
      "lines attached to a running sperm whale have, in a calm, been\r\n",
      "transferred to the ship, and secured there; the whale towing her\r\n",
      "great hull through the water, as a horse walks off with a cart.\r\n",
      "Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm whale, once\r\n",
      "struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often with\r\n",
      "blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his\r\n",
      "pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his\r\n",
      "character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his\r\n",
      "mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive\r\n",
      "minutes.  But I must be content with only one more and a concluding\r\n",
      "illustration; a remarkable and most significant one, by which you\r\n",
      "will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous event in\r\n",
      "this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but that\r\n",
      "these marvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages; so\r\n",
      "that for the millionth time we say amen with Solomon--Verily there is\r\n",
      "nothing new under the sun.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian\r\n",
      "magistrate of Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor\r\n",
      "and Belisarius general.  As many know, he wrote the history of his\r\n",
      "own times, a work every way of uncommon value.  By the best\r\n",
      "authorities, he has always been considered a most trustworthy and\r\n",
      "unexaggerating historian, except in some one or two particulars, not\r\n",
      "at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term\r\n",
      "of his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured\r\n",
      "in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having\r\n",
      "destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more\r\n",
      "than fifty years.  A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot\r\n",
      "easily be gainsaid.  Nor is there any reason it should be.  Of what\r\n",
      "precise species this sea-monster was, is not mentioned.  But as he\r\n",
      "destroyed ships, as well as for other reasons, he must have been a\r\n",
      "whale; and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale.  And I will\r\n",
      "tell you why.  For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had\r\n",
      "been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters\r\n",
      "connecting with it.  Even now I am certain that those seas are not,\r\n",
      "and perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of things, a\r\n",
      "place for his habitual gregarious resort.  But further investigations\r\n",
      "have recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been\r\n",
      "isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the\r\n",
      "Mediterranean.  I am told, on good authority, that on the Barbary\r\n",
      "coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a\r\n",
      "sperm whale.  Now, as a vessel of war readily passes through the\r\n",
      "Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route, pass out\r\n",
      "of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar\r\n",
      "substance called BRIT is to be found, the aliment of the right whale.\r\n",
      "But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm\r\n",
      "whale--squid or cuttle-fish--lurks at the bottom of that sea, because\r\n",
      "large creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been\r\n",
      "found at its surface.  If, then, you properly put these statements\r\n",
      "together, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that,\r\n",
      "according to all human reasoning, Procopius's sea-monster, that for\r\n",
      "half a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all\r\n",
      "probability have been a sperm whale.\r\n",

      "altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage.  Or\r\n",
      "at least if this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives\r\n",

      "vindictiveness towards the White Whale might have possibly extended\r\n",
      "itself in some degree to all sperm whales, and that the more monsters\r\n",
      "he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "It might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was\r\n",
      "seen.  During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall\r\n",
      "into open relapses of rebellion against his captain's leadership,\r\n",
      "unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences were\r\n",

      "than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that, for\r\n",
      "the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange\r\n",
      "imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the full\r\n",
      "terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure\r\n",
      "background (for few men's courage is proof against protracted\r\n",
      "meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long\r\n",
      "night watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to\r\n",
      "think of than Moby Dick.  For however eagerly and impetuously the\r\n",
      "savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors\r\n",
      "of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable--they live in\r\n",
      "the varying outer weather, and they inhale its fickleness--and when\r\n",
      "retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit, however\r\n",
      "promissory of life and passion in the end, it is above all things\r\n",
      "requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene\r\n",
      "and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash.\r\n",

      "Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing.  In times of strong emotion\r\n",
      "mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are\r\n",
      "evanescent.  The permanent constitutional condition of the\r\n",
      "manufactured man, thought Ahab, is sordidness.  Granting that the\r\n",
      "White Whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew, and\r\n",
      "playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous\r\n",

      "chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food for their more common,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat.  As I\r\n",

      "dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the\r\n",
      "sea, only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it\r\n",
      "seemed as if this were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle\r\n",
      "mechanically weaving and weaving away at the Fates.  There lay the\r\n",
      "fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single, ever returning,\r\n",
      "unchanging vibration, and that vibration merely enough to admit of\r\n",

      "incompatible--all interweavingly working together.  The straight warp\r\n",
      "of necessity, not to be swerved from its ultimate course--its every\r\n",

      "hitherto muffled by the storm.  The sound came nearer and nearer; the\r\n",
      "thick mists were dimly parted by a huge, vague form.  Affrighted, we\r\n",

      "no more till it came up weltering astern.  Again we swam for it, were\r\n",
      "dashed against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely\r\n",
      "landed on board.  Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had\r\n",
      "cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time.  The\r\n",

      "I tell ye what, men, old Rad's investment must go for it! he had\r\n",
      "best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home.  The fact is,\r\n",
      "boys, that sword-fish only began the job; he's come back again with a\r\n",

      "the whole posse of 'em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at\r\n",
      "the bottom; making improvements, I suppose.  If old Rad were here\r\n",
      "now, I'd tell him to jump overboard and scatter 'em.  They're playing\r\n",
      "the devil with his estate, I can tell him.  But he's a simple old\r\n",
      "soul,--Rad, and a beauty too.  Boys, they say the rest of his\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "lively, now!'  And with that the pump clanged like fifty\r\n",
      "fire-engines; the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that\r\n",
      "peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest\r\n",
      "tension of life's utmost energies.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "his brow.  Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed\r\n",
      "Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated\r\n",
      "state, I know not; but so it happened.  Intolerably striding along\r\n",
      "the deck, the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the\r\n",
      "planks, and also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters\r\n",
      "consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.\r\n",

      "of ships actually foundering at the time.  Such, gentlemen, is the\r\n",
      "inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in\r\n",
      "seamen; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing\r\n",
      "their faces.  But in all vessels this broom business is the\r\n",
      "prescriptive province of the boys, if boys there be aboard.  Besides,\r\n",
      "it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that had been divided into\r\n",
      "gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most athletic seaman\r\n",
      "of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of\r\n",
      "the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial\r\n",
      "business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the\r\n",
      "case with his comrades.  I mention all these particulars so that you\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost\r\n",
      "as plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had\r\n",
      "spat in his face.  Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will\r\n",
      "understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman\r\n",
      "fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command.  But as he sat\r\n",
      "still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's\r\n",
      "malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in\r\n",
      "him and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he\r\n",
      "instinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and\r\n",
      "unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already\r\n",
      "ireful being--a repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really\r\n",
      "valiant men even when aggrieved--this nameless phantom feeling,\r\n",

      "then, without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three\r\n",
      "lads as the customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the\r\n",
      "pumps, had done little or nothing all day.  To this, Radney replied\r\n",
      "with an oath, in a most domineering and outrageous manner\r\n",

      "not the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with\r\n",
      "his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it\r\n",
      "was to no purpose.  And in this way the two went once slowly round\r\n",

      "something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to\r\n",
      "the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is\r\n",
      "moored alongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon\r\n",

      "those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the\r\n",
      "present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman.  It is\r\n",
      "time to set the world right in this matter, by proving such pictures\r\n",
      "of the whale all wrong.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions\r\n",
      "will be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian\r\n",
      "sculptures.  For ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times\r\n",
      "when on the marble panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues,\r\n",
      "and on shields, medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in\r\n",
      "scales of chain-armor like Saladin's, and a helmeted head like St.\r\n",
      "George's; ever since then has something of the same sort of license\r\n",
      "prevailed, not only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in\r\n",
      "many scientific presentations of him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting\r\n",
      "to be the whale's, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of\r\n",
      "Elephanta, in India.  The Brahmins maintain that in the almost\r\n",
      "endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and\r\n",
      "pursuits, every conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages\r\n",
      "before any of them actually came into being.  No wonder then, that in\r\n",
      "some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there\r\n",
      "shadowed forth.  The Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate\r\n",

      "whit better.  The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster\r\n",
      "undulates on the surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water.  It has\r\n",
      "a sort of howdah on its back, and its distended tusked mouth into\r\n",
      "which the billows are rolling, might be taken for the Traitors' Gate\r\n",
      "leading from the Thames by water into the Tower.  Then, there are the\r\n",

      "and gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both old and\r\n",
      "new--that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature,\r\n",

      "book-binder's fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so intended\r\n",
      "when the device was first introduced.  It was introduced by an old\r\n",
      "Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the\r\n",
      "Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a\r\n",
      "comparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a\r\n",

      "represented lying among ice-isles, with white bears running over\r\n",

      "Cape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the\r\n",

      "from one killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on\r\n",

      "me say that it has an eye which applied, according to the\r\n",
      "accompanying scale, to a full grown sperm whale, would make the eye\r\n",

      "Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacepede, a great\r\n",
      "naturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are\r\n",

      "Greenland whale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a\r\n",
      "long experienced man as touching that species, declares not to have\r\n",
      "its counterpart in nature.\r\n",

      "But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was\r\n",
      "reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous\r\n",
      "Baron.  In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which\r\n",
      "he gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale.  Before showing\r\n",

      "the benefit of a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he\r\n",
      "derived that picture, who can tell?  Perhaps he got it as his\r\n",
      "scientific predecessor in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his\r\n",
      "authentic abortions; that is, from a Chinese drawing.  And what sort\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "As for the sign-painters' whales seen in the streets hanging over the\r\n",

      "Richard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage;\r\n",
      "breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full\r\n",
      "of mariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue\r\n",
      "paint.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very\r\n",
      "surprising after all.  Consider!  Most of the scientific drawings\r\n",
      "have been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as\r\n",
      "correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would\r\n",
      "correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride\r\n",
      "of hull and spars.  Though elephants have stood for their\r\n",
      "full-lengths, the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated\r\n",
      "himself for his portrait.  The living whale, in his full majesty and\r\n",
      "significance, is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters; and\r\n",
      "afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight, like a launched\r\n",
      "line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a thing eternally\r\n",
      "impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so as to\r\n",
      "preserve all his mighty swells and undulations.  And, not to speak of\r\n",
      "the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking\r\n",
      "whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of\r\n",
      "one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship's deck, such is\r\n",
      "then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that\r\n",
      "his precise expression the devil himself could not catch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded\r\n",
      "whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form.  Not at\r\n",
      "all.  For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan,\r\n",
      "that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape.\r\n",
      "Though Jeremy Bentham's skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the\r\n",
      "library of one of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a\r\n",
      "burly-browed utilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy's other\r\n",
      "leading personal characteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be\r\n",
      "inferred from any leviathan's articulated bones.  In fact, as the\r\n",
      "great Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same\r\n",
      "relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does\r\n",
      "to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it.  This peculiarity\r\n",
      "is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this book will\r\n",
      "be incidentally shown.  It is also very curiously displayed in the\r\n",
      "side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the\r\n",
      "human hand, minus only the thumb.  This fin has four regular\r\n",
      "bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger.  But all\r\n",
      "these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human\r\n",
      "fingers in an artificial covering.  \"However recklessly the whale may\r\n",
      "sometimes serve us,\" said humorous Stubb one day, \"he can never be\r\n",
      "truly said to handle us without mittens.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must\r\n",
      "needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the\r\n",
      "world which must remain unpainted to the last.  True, one portrait\r\n",
      "may hit the mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with\r\n",
      "any very considerable degree of exactness.  So there is no earthly\r\n",
      "way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like.  And\r\n",
      "the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his\r\n",
      "living contour, is by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you\r\n",

      "and taken from paintings by one Garnery.  Respectively, they\r\n",

      "just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and\r\n",
      "bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the\r\n",
      "stoven planks.  The prow of the boat is partially unbroken, and is\r\n",
      "drawn just balancing upon the monster's spine; and standing in that\r\n",
      "prow, for that one single incomputable flash of time, you behold an\r\n",
      "oarsman, half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale,\r\n",
      "and in the act of leaping, as if from a precipice.  The action of the\r\n",
      "whole thing is wonderfully good and true.  The half-emptied line-tub\r\n",
      "floats on the whitened sea; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons\r\n",
      "obliquely bob in it; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered\r\n",
      "about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright; while in the\r\n",
      "black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene.\r\n",
      "Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this\r\n",
      "whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I could not draw\r\n",
      "so good a one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside\r\n",
      "the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his\r\n",
      "black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the\r\n",
      "Patagonian cliffs.  His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so\r\n",
      "that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there\r\n",
      "must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below.  Sea fowls\r\n",
      "are pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and\r\n",
      "maccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent\r\n",
      "back.  And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing\r\n",
      "through the deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake,\r\n",
      "and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught\r\n",
      "nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer.  Thus, the foreground is\r\n",

      "The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all\r\n",
      "hands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but\r\n",
      "when you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet\r\n",
      "long, it takes away your appetite.  Only the most unprejudiced of men\r\n",
      "like Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are\r\n",
      "not so fastidious.  We all know how they live upon whales, and have\r\n",
      "rare old vintages of prime old train oil.  Zogranda, one of their\r\n",
      "most famous doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as\r\n",
      "being exceedingly juicy and nourishing.  And this reminds me that\r\n",
      "certain Englishmen, who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland\r\n",
      "by a whaling vessel--that these men actually lived for several months\r\n",
      "on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after\r\n",
      "trying out the blubber.  Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps are\r\n",
      "called \"fritters\"; which, indeed, they greatly resemble, being brown\r\n",
      "and crisp, and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives'\r\n",

      "exceeding richness.  He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to\r\n",
      "be delicately good.  Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating\r\n",
      "as the buffalo's (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a\r\n",
      "solid pyramid of fat.  But the spermaceti itself, how bland and\r\n",

      "cocoanut in the third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply\r\n",

      "of absorbing it into some other substance, and then partaking of it.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon\r\n",
      "speaking a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the\r\n",
      "existence of Moby Dick, and the havoc he had made.  Greedily sucking\r\n",
      "in this intelligence, Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against\r\n",
      "attacking the White Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his\r\n",
      "gibbering insanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being\r\n",
      "than the Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible.  But\r\n",
      "when, some year or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from\r\n",
      "the mast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardour to encounter\r\n",
      "him; and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the\r\n",
      "opportunity, despite all the archangel's denunciations and\r\n",

      "With them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many\r\n",
      "perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one\r\n",
      "iron fast.  Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head,\r\n",
      "was tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies\r\n",
      "of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity.  Now,\r\n",
      "while Macey, the mate, was standing up in his boat's bow, and with\r\n",
      "all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild\r\n",
      "exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to get a fair chance for\r\n",
      "his poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its\r\n",
      "quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the\r\n",
      "bodies of the oarsmen.  Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of\r\n",
      "furious life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a long arc\r\n",
      "in his descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty\r\n",
      "yards.  Not a chip of the boat was harmed, nor a hair of any\r\n",

      "hunting of the whale.  This terrible event clothed the archangel with\r\n",
      "added influence; because his credulous disciples believed that he had\r\n",
      "specifically fore-announced it, instead of only making a general\r\n",
      "prophecy, which any one might have done, and so have chanced to hit\r\n",

      "but a dim scrawl;--what's this?\"  As he was studying it out, Starbuck\r\n",
      "took a long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the\r\n",
      "end, to insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right\r\n",
      "Whale are by far the most noteworthy.  They are the only whales\r\n",
      "regularly hunted by man.  To the Nantucketer, they present the two\r\n",
      "extremes of all the known varieties of the whale.  As the external\r\n",
      "difference between them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a\r\n",
      "head of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod's side; and as we\r\n",

      "deck:--where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance\r\n",
      "to study practical cetology than here?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between\r\n",
      "these heads.  Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there\r\n",
      "is a certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale's which the\r\n",
      "Right Whale's sadly lacks.  There is more character in the Sperm\r\n",
      "Whale's head.  As you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense\r\n",
      "superiority to him, in point of pervading dignity.  In the present\r\n",
      "instance, too, this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt\r\n",
      "colour of his head at the summit, giving token of advanced age and\r\n",
      "large experience.  In short, he is what the fishermen technically\r\n",
      "call a \"grey-headed whale.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads--namely, the\r\n",
      "two most important organs, the eye and the ear.  Far back on the side\r\n",
      "of the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale's jaw, if\r\n",
      "you narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you\r\n",
      "would fancy to be a young colt's eye; so out of all proportion is it\r\n",
      "to the magnitude of the head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale's eyes, it is\r\n",
      "plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more\r\n",
      "than he can one exactly astern.  In a word, the position of the\r\n",
      "whale's eyes corresponds to that of a man's ears; and you may fancy,\r\n",
      "for yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey\r\n",
      "objects through your ears.  You would find that you could only\r\n",
      "command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight\r\n",
      "side-line of sight; and about thirty more behind it.  If your\r\n",
      "bitterest foe were walking straight towards you, with dagger uplifted\r\n",
      "in broad day, you would not be able to see him, any more than if he\r\n",
      "were stealing upon you from behind.  In a word, you would have two\r\n",
      "backs, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side\r\n",
      "fronts): for what is it that makes the front of a man--what, indeed,\r\n",
      "but his eyes?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the\r\n",
      "eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so\r\n",
      "as to produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar\r\n",
      "position of the whale's eyes, effectually divided as they are by many\r\n",
      "cubic feet of solid head, which towers between them like a great\r\n",
      "mountain separating two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must\r\n",
      "wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts.\r\n",
      "The whale, therefore, must see one distinct picture on this side,\r\n",

      "profound darkness and nothingness to him.  Man may, in effect, be\r\n",
      "said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with two joined\r\n",
      "sashes for his window.  But with the whale, these two sashes are\r\n",
      "separately inserted, making two distinct windows, but sadly impairing\r\n",
      "the view.  This peculiarity of the whale's eyes is a thing always to\r\n",
      "be borne in mind in the fishery; and to be remembered by the reader\r\n",
      "in some subsequent scenes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this\r\n",
      "visual matter as touching the Leviathan.  But I must be content with\r\n",
      "a hint.  So long as a man's eyes are open in the light, the act of\r\n",
      "seeing is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically\r\n",
      "seeing whatever objects are before him.  Nevertheless, any one's\r\n",
      "experience will teach him, that though he can take in an\r\n",
      "undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance, it is quite\r\n",
      "impossible for him, attentively, and completely, to examine any two\r\n",
      "things--however large or however small--at one and the same instant\r\n",
      "of time; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other.\r\n",
      "But if you now come to separate these two objects, and surround each\r\n",
      "by a circle of profound darkness; then, in order to see one of them,\r\n",
      "in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other will\r\n",
      "be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness.  How is it,\r\n",
      "then, with the whale?  True, both his eyes, in themselves, must\r\n",
      "simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more comprehensive,\r\n",
      "combining, and subtle than man's, that he can at the same moment of\r\n",
      "time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one side of\r\n",
      "him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction?  If he can, then\r\n",
      "is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able\r\n",
      "simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct\r\n",
      "problems in Euclid.  Nor, strictly investigated, is there any\r\n",

      "beset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer\r\n",
      "frights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly\r\n",
      "proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their\r\n",
      "divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve\r\n",
      "them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye.  If you are\r\n",

      "for hours, and never discover that organ.  The ear has no external\r\n",
      "leaf whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a\r\n",
      "quill, so wondrously minute is it.  It is lodged a little behind the\r\n",
      "eye.  With respect to their ears, this important difference is to be\r\n",
      "observed between the sperm whale and the right.  While the ear of\r\n",
      "the former has an external opening, that of the latter is entirely\r\n",

      "all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you\r\n",
      "not think you were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing\r\n",
      "upon its thousand pipes?  For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of\r\n",
      "the softest Turkey--the tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the\r\n",
      "floor of the mouth.  It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in\r\n",

      "his shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe\r\n",

      "when reaching out his knife and fork, between which the slice of beef\r\n",
      "was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck's plate towards him, the\r\n",
      "mate received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly;\r\n",
      "and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the\r\n",
      "plate; and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without\r\n",

      "the German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial\r\n",
      "Electors, so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in\r\n",

      "been the drumsticks.  For Flask to have presumed to help himself,\r\n",
      "this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first\r\n",
      "degree.  Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more\r\n",
      "would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world;\r\n",

      "helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed\r\n",
      "it.  Least of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter.\r\n",
      "Whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on\r\n",
      "account of its clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he\r\n",
      "deemed that, on so long a voyage in such marketless waters, butter\r\n",
      "was at a premium, and therefore was not for him, a subaltern; however\r\n",
      "it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another thing.  Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and\r\n",
      "Flask is the first man up.  Consider!  For hereby Flask's dinner was\r\n",
      "badly jammed in point of time.  Starbuck and Stubb both had the start\r\n",
      "of him; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear.\r\n",
      "If Stubb even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have\r\n",
      "but a small appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his\r\n",
      "repast, then Flask must bestir himself, he will not get more than\r\n",
      "three mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to\r\n",
      "precede Flask to the deck.  Therefore it was that Flask once admitted\r\n",
      "in private, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an\r\n",
      "officer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be\r\n",
      "otherwise than hungry, more or less.  For what he ate did not so much\r\n",

      "There's the fruits of promotion now; there's the vanity of glory:\r\n",
      "there's the insanity of life!  Besides, if it were so that any mere\r\n",

      "capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample\r\n",
      "vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask\r\n",
      "through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before\r\n",
      "awful Ahab.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first\r\n",
      "table in the Pequod's cabin.  After their departure, taking place in\r\n",
      "inverted order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or\r\n",
      "rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward.  And\r\n",
      "then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless\r\n",
      "invisible domineerings of the captain's table, was the entire\r\n",
      "care-free license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those\r\n",
      "inferior fellows the harpooneers.  While their masters, the mates,\r\n",
      "seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the\r\n",
      "harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a\r\n",
      "report to it.  They dined like lords; they filled their bellies like\r\n",
      "Indian ships all day loading with spices.  Such portentous appetites\r\n",
      "had Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out the vacancies made by the\r\n",
      "previous repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a\r\n",
      "great baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the solid ox.\r\n",
      "And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with a nimble\r\n",
      "hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of\r\n",
      "accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise.  And\r\n",
      "once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy's memory\r\n",
      "by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty\r\n",
      "wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the\r\n",
      "circle preliminary to scalping him.  He was naturally a very nervous,\r\n",
      "shuddering sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the\r\n",
      "progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse.  And what with the\r\n",
      "standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the periodical\r\n",
      "tumultuous visitations of these three savages, Dough-Boy's whole life\r\n",
      "was one continual lip-quiver.  Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers\r\n",
      "furnished with all things they demanded, he would escape from their\r\n",
      "clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and fearfully peep out at\r\n",
      "them through the blinds of its door, till all was over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing\r\n",
      "his filed teeth to the Indian's: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on\r\n",
      "the floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to\r\n",
      "the low carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the\r\n",
      "low cabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes\r\n",
      "passenger in a ship.  But for all this, the great negro was\r\n",
      "wonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty.  It seemed hardly possible\r\n",
      "that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the\r\n",
      "vitality diffused through so broad, baronial, and superb a person.\r\n",
      "But, doubtless, this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the\r\n",
      "abounding element of air; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in\r\n",
      "the sublime life of the worlds.  Not by beef or by bread, are giants\r\n",
      "made or nourished.  But Queequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric smack of\r\n",
      "the lip in eating--an ugly sound enough--so much so, that the\r\n",
      "trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth\r\n",
      "lurked in his own lean arms.  And when he would hear Tashtego singing\r\n",
      "out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be picked, the\r\n",
      "simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round\r\n",
      "him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy.  Nor did the\r\n",
      "whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their\r\n",
      "lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they\r\n",
      "would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not\r\n",
      "at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy.  How could he forget that\r\n",
      "in his Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been\r\n",
      "guilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions.  Alas!  Dough-Boy!\r\n",
      "hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals.  Not a napkin\r\n",
      "should he carry on his arm, but a buckler.  In good time, though, to\r\n",
      "his great delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart;\r\n",
      "to his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones\r\n",
      "jingling in them at every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.\r\n",

      "But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived\r\n",
      "there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were\r\n",
      "scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before\r\n",

      "quarters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale\r\n",

      "the ship's cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone\r\n",
      "that anybody else is, at any time, permitted there.  So that, in real\r\n",

      "said to have lived out of the cabin than in it.  For when they did\r\n",
      "enter it, it was something as a street-door enters a house; turning\r\n",
      "inwards for a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a\r\n",
      "permanent thing, residing in the open air.  Nor did they lose much\r\n",
      "hereby; in the cabin was no companionship; socially, Ahab was\r\n",
      "inaccessible.  Though nominally included in the census of\r\n",
      "Christendom, he was still an alien to it.  He lived in the world, as\r\n",
      "the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri.  And as when\r\n",
      "Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of the woods, burying\r\n",
      "himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there, sucking\r\n",
      "his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age, Ahab's soul,\r\n",

      "that the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers, is an\r\n",
      "assertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists, that\r\n",
      "the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes: a theory\r\n",
      "singularly supported by the peculiar stair-like formation of all four\r\n",
      "sides of those edifices; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of\r\n",
      "their legs, those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and\r\n",
      "sing out for new stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing\r\n",

      "the famous Christian hermit of old times, who built him a lofty stone\r\n",

      "him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless\r\n",
      "stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place by\r\n",
      "fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything\r\n",
      "out to the last, literally died at his post.  Of modern\r\n",

      "not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole\r\n",

      "us, that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were\r\n",
      "regularly launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island\r\n",

      "to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful.  There you stand, a\r\n",
      "hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the deep, as if\r\n",

      "move out of it, without running great risk of perishing (like an\r\n",

      "individual cause.  In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter\r\n",
      "between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by\r\n",
      "chance caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had\r\n",
      "every one of them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him,\r\n",
      "as for any other whale of that species.  But at length, such\r\n",
      "calamities did ensue in these assaults--not restricted to sprained\r\n",
      "wrists and ankles, broken limbs, or devouring amputations--but fatal\r\n",
      "to the last degree of fatality; those repeated disastrous repulses,\r\n",
      "all accumulating and piling their terrors upon Moby Dick; those\r\n",
      "things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters, to\r\n",

      "wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate\r\n",

      "ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors; but of all\r\n",
      "sailors, they are by all odds the most directly brought into contact\r\n",
      "with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face\r\n",
      "they not only eye its greatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle\r\n",
      "to them.  Alone, in such remotest waters, that though you sailed a\r\n",
      "thousand miles, and passed a thousand shores, you would not come to\r\n",
      "any chiseled hearth-stone, or aught hospitable beneath that part of\r\n",

      "No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit\r\n",
      "over the widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale\r\n",
      "did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid\r\n",
      "hints, and half-formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies,\r\n",
      "which eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from\r\n",
      "anything that visibly appears.  So that in many cases such a panic\r\n",
      "did he finally strike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had\r\n",
      "heard of the White Whale, few of those hunters were willing to\r\n",
      "encounter the perils of his jaw.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But there were still other and more vital practical influences at\r\n",

      "Sperm Whale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the\r\n",
      "leviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body.  There\r\n",

      "enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale, would\r\n",
      "perhaps--either from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or\r\n",
      "timidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there\r\n",
      "are plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary\r\n",
      "times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book\r\n",
      "naturalists--Olassen and Povelson--declaring the Sperm Whale not only\r\n",
      "to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to\r\n",
      "be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human\r\n",
      "blood.  Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier's, were these or\r\n",
      "almost similar impressions effaced.  For in his Natural History, the\r\n",
      "Baron himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish\r\n",

      "\"often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against\r\n",
      "the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death.\"  And\r\n",
      "however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports\r\n",
      "as these; yet in their full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty\r\n",
      "item of Povelson, the superstitious belief in them is, in some\r\n",
      "vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few\r\n",

      "days of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to\r\n",
      "induce long practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this\r\n",
      "new and daring warfare; such men protesting that although other\r\n",
      "leviathans might be hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance\r\n",
      "at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man.\r\n",
      "That to attempt it, would be inevitably to be torn into a quick\r\n",
      "eternity.  On this head, there are some remarkable documents that may\r\n",
      "be consulted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things\r\n",
      "were ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number\r\n",
      "who, chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the\r\n",
      "specific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious\r\n",
      "accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle\r\n",
      "if offered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be\r\n",
      "linked with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously\r\n",
      "inclined, was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous;\r\n",
      "that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one\r\n",
      "and the same instant of time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit\r\n",
      "altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability.  For\r\n",
      "as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been\r\n",
      "divulged, even to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of\r\n",
      "the Sperm Whale when beneath the surface remain, in great part,\r\n",
      "unaccountable to his pursuers; and from time to time have originated\r\n",
      "the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them,\r\n",
      "especially concerning the mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a\r\n",
      "great depth, he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the\r\n",
      "most widely distant points.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships,\r\n",
      "and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by\r\n",
      "Scoresby, that some whales have been captured far north in the\r\n",
      "Pacific, in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted\r\n",
      "in the Greenland seas.  Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of\r\n",
      "these instances it has been declared that the interval of time\r\n",
      "between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days.\r\n",
      "Hence, by inference, it has been believed by some whalemen, that the\r\n",
      "Nor' West Passage, so long a problem to man, was never a problem to\r\n",
      "the whale.  So that here, in the real living experience of living\r\n",
      "men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello\r\n",
      "mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in\r\n",
      "which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still\r\n",
      "more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose\r\n",
      "waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by an\r\n",
      "underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost fully\r\n",
      "equalled by the realities of the whalemen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and\r\n",
      "knowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had\r\n",
      "escaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some\r\n",
      "whalemen should go still further in their superstitions; declaring\r\n",
      "Moby Dick not only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but\r\n",
      "ubiquity in time); that though groves of spears should be planted in\r\n",
      "his flanks, he would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should\r\n",
      "ever be made to spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a\r\n",
      "ghastly deception; for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of\r\n",
      "leagues away, his unsullied jet would once more be seen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough\r\n",
      "in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to\r\n",
      "strike the imagination with unwonted power.  For, it was not so much\r\n",
      "his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm\r\n",
      "whales, but, as was elsewhere thrown out--a peculiar snow-white\r\n",
      "wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump.  These were\r\n",
      "his prominent features; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless,\r\n",
      "uncharted seas, he revealed his identity, at a long distance, to\r\n",
      "those who knew him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with\r\n",
      "the same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his\r\n",
      "distinctive appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally\r\n",
      "justified by his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through\r\n",
      "a dark blue sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all\r\n",
      "spangled with golden gleamings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet\r\n",
      "his deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural\r\n",
      "terror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to\r\n",
      "specific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his\r\n",
      "assaults.  More than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of\r\n",
      "dismay than perhaps aught else.  For, when swimming before his\r\n",
      "exulting pursuers, with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had\r\n",
      "several times been known to turn round suddenly, and, bearing down\r\n",
      "upon them, either stave their boats to splinters, or drive them back\r\n",
      "in consternation to their ship.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Already several fatalities had attended his chase.  But though\r\n",
      "similar disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means\r\n",
      "unusual in the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White\r\n",
      "Whale's infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or\r\n",
      "death that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been\r\n",
      "inflicted by an unintelligent agent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds\r\n",
      "of his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of\r\n",
      "chewed boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out\r\n",
      "of the white curds of the whale's direful wrath into the serene,\r\n",
      "exasperating sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in\r\n",
      "the eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow,\r\n",
      "had dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly\r\n",
      "seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the\r\n",
      "whale.  That captain was Ahab.  And then it was, that suddenly\r\n",
      "sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had\r\n",
      "reaped away Ahab's leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field.  No\r\n",
      "turbaned Turk, no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with\r\n",
      "more seeming malice.  Small reason was there to doubt, then, that\r\n",
      "ever since that almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild\r\n",
      "vindictiveness against the whale, all the more fell for that in his\r\n",
      "frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him, not only all\r\n",
      "his bodily woes, but all his intellectual and spiritual\r\n",
      "exasperations.  The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac\r\n",
      "incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel\r\n",
      "eating in them, till they are left living on with half a heart and\r\n",
      "half a lung.  That intangible malignity which has been from the\r\n",
      "beginning; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe\r\n",
      "one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east\r\n",
      "reverenced in their statue devil;--Ahab did not fall down and worship\r\n",
      "it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred\r\n",
      "white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it.  All that\r\n",
      "most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all\r\n",
      "truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the\r\n",
      "brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to\r\n",
      "crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable\r\n",
      "in Moby Dick.  He piled upon the whale's white hump the sum of all\r\n",
      "the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and\r\n",
      "then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart's\r\n",
      "shell upon it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise\r\n",
      "at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment.  Then, in darting at\r\n",
      "the monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden,\r\n",
      "passionate, corporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that\r\n",
      "tore him, he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but\r\n",
      "nothing more.  Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards\r\n",
      "home, and for long months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay\r\n",
      "stretched together in one hammock, rounding in mid winter that\r\n",
      "dreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his torn body and\r\n",
      "gashed soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made him mad.\r\n",
      "That it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the encounter,\r\n",
      "that the final monomania seized him, seems all but certain from the\r\n",
      "fact that, at intervals during the passage, he was a raving lunatic;\r\n",
      "and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in\r\n",
      "his Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his delirium,\r\n",
      "that his mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he\r\n",
      "sailed, raving in his hammock.  In a strait-jacket, he swung to the\r\n",
      "mad rockings of the gales.  And, when running into more sufferable\r\n",
      "latitudes, the ship, with mild stun'sails spread, floated across the\r\n",
      "tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man's delirium\r\n",
      "seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn swells, and he came forth\r\n",
      "from his dark den into the blessed light and air; even then, when he\r\n",
      "bore that firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his calm\r\n",
      "orders once again; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was\r\n",
      "now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on.  Human\r\n",
      "madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.  When you\r\n",
      "think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still\r\n",
      "subtler form.  Ahab's full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly\r\n",
      "contracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows\r\n",
      "narrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge.  But, as in\r\n",
      "his narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab's broad madness had\r\n",
      "been left behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great\r\n",
      "natural intellect had perished.  That before living agent, now became\r\n",
      "the living instrument.  If such a furious trope may stand, his\r\n",
      "special lunacy stormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned\r\n",
      "all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from\r\n",
      "having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a\r\n",
      "thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear\r\n",
      "upon any one reasonable object.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This is much; yet Ahab's larger, darker, deeper part remains\r\n",
      "unhinted.  But vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is\r\n",
      "profound.  Winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked\r\n",
      "Hotel de Cluny where we here stand--however grand and wonderful, now\r\n",
      "quit it;--and take your way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast\r\n",
      "Roman halls of Thermes; where far beneath the fantastic towers of\r\n",
      "man's upper earth, his root of grandeur, his whole awful essence sits\r\n",
      "in bearded state; an antique buried beneath antiquities, and throned\r\n",
      "on torsoes!  So with a broken throne, the great gods mock that\r\n",
      "captive king; so like a Caryatid, he patient sits, upholding on his\r\n",
      "frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages.  Wind ye down there, ye\r\n",
      "prouder, sadder souls! question that proud, sad king!  A family\r\n",
      "likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled royalties; and from\r\n",
      "your grim sire only will the old State-secret come.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my\r\n",
      "means are sane, my motive and my object mad.  Yet without power to\r\n",
      "kill, or change, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind\r\n",
      "he did long dissemble; in some sort, did still.  But that thing of\r\n",
      "his dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility, not to his\r\n",
      "will determinate.  Nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that\r\n",
      "dissembling, that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no\r\n",
      "Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved, and\r\n",
      "that to the quick, with the terrible casualty which had overtaken\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly\r\n",

      "which always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on\r\n",

      "unlikely, that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling\r\n",
      "voyage, on account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of\r\n",

      "Gnawed within and scorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting\r\n",

      "most appalling of all brutes.  Or, if for any reason thought to be\r\n",
      "corporeally incapacitated for that, yet such an one would seem\r\n",
      "superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the\r\n",
      "attack.  But be all this as it may, certain it is, that with the mad\r\n",
      "secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him, Ahab had\r\n",
      "purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and\r\n",
      "all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale.  Had any one of his\r\n",

      "Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851.  By that circular, it\r\n",
      "appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and\r\n",
      "portions of it are presented in the circular.  \"This chart divides\r\n",
      "the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees\r\n",
      "of longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are\r\n",
      "twelve columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each\r\n",

      "called; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such\r\n",
      "undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any\r\n",
      "chart, with one tithe of such marvellous precision.  Though, in these\r\n",
      "cases, the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a\r\n",
      "surveyor's parallel, and though the line of advance be strictly\r\n",
      "confined to its own unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary\r\n",
      "VEIN in which at these times he is said to swim, generally embraces\r\n",
      "some few miles in width (more or less, as the vein is presumed to\r\n",
      "expand or contract); but never exceeds the visual sweep from the\r\n",
      "whale-ship's mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along this magic\r\n",
      "zone.  The sum is, that at particular seasons within that breadth and\r\n",
      "along that path, migrating whales may with great confidence be looked\r\n",
      "for.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate\r\n",
      "feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in\r\n",
      "crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could,\r\n",
      "by his art, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to\r\n",
      "be wholly without prospect of a meeting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his\r\n",
      "delirious but still methodical scheme.  But not so in the reality,\r\n",
      "perhaps.  Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular\r\n",
      "seasons for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude\r\n",
      "that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude\r\n",
      "this year, say, will turn out to be identically the same with those\r\n",
      "that were found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar\r\n",
      "and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved\r\n",
      "true.  In general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit,\r\n",
      "applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm\r\n",
      "whales.  So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for\r\n",
      "example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean,\r\n",
      "or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that\r\n",
      "were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent\r\n",
      "corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there.  So,\r\n",
      "too, with some other feeding grounds, where he had at times revealed\r\n",
      "himself.  But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and\r\n",
      "ocean-inns, so to speak, not his places of prolonged abode.  And\r\n",
      "where Ahab's chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been\r\n",
      "spoken of, allusion has only been made to whatever way-side,\r\n",
      "antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a particular set time or\r\n",
      "place were attained, when all possibilities would become\r\n",
      "probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the\r\n",
      "next thing to a certainty.  That particular set time and place were\r\n",
      "conjoined in the one technical phrase--the Season-on-the-Line.  For\r\n",
      "there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been\r\n",
      "periodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the\r\n",
      "sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any one\r\n",
      "sign of the Zodiac.  There it was, too, that most of the deadly\r\n",
      "encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the waves were\r\n",
      "storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot where the\r\n",
      "monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance.  But\r\n",
      "in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with\r\n",
      "which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt, he\r\n",
      "would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning\r\n",
      "fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those hopes;\r\n",
      "nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his\r\n",
      "unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of\r\n",
      "the Season-on-the-Line.  No possible endeavor then could enable her\r\n",
      "commander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and\r\n",
      "then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial\r\n",
      "Pacific in time to cruise there.  Therefore, he must wait for the\r\n",
      "next ensuing season.  Yet the premature hour of the Pequod's sailing\r\n",
      "had, perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this\r\n",
      "very complexion of things.  Because, an interval of three hundred and\r\n",
      "sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead\r\n",
      "of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous\r\n",
      "hunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far\r\n",
      "remote from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his\r\n",
      "wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China\r\n",
      "Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race.  So that Monsoons,\r\n",
      "Pampas, Nor'-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter\r\n",
      "and Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag\r\n",
      "world-circle of the Pequod's circumnavigating wake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it\r\n",
      "not but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one\r\n",
      "solitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of\r\n",
      "individual recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti\r\n",
      "in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople?  Yes.  For the\r\n",
      "peculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could\r\n",
      "not but be unmistakable.  And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab\r\n",
      "would mutter to himself, as after poring over his charts till long\r\n",
      "after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries--tallied him,\r\n",
      "and shall he escape?  His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out\r\n",
      "like a lost sheep's ear!  And here, his mad mind would run on in a\r\n",
      "breathless race; till a weariness and faintness of pondering came\r\n",
      "over him; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover\r\n",
      "his strength.  Ah, God! what trances of torments does that man endure\r\n",
      "who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire.  He sleeps\r\n",

      "vivid dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts\r\n",
      "through the day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and\r\n",
      "whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain, till\r\n",
      "the very throbbing of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and\r\n",
      "when, as was sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved\r\n",
      "his being up from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from\r\n",
      "which forked flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends\r\n",
      "beckoned him to leap down among them; when this hell in himself\r\n",
      "yawned beneath him, a wild cry would be heard through the ship; and\r\n",
      "with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room, as though\r\n",
      "escaping from a bed that was on fire.  Yet these, perhaps, instead of\r\n",
      "being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright\r\n",
      "at his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity.\r\n",
      "For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast\r\n",
      "hunter of the white whale; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock,\r\n",
      "was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror\r\n",
      "again.  The latter was the eternal, living principle or soul in him;\r\n",
      "and in sleep, being for the time dissociated from the characterizing\r\n",
      "mind, which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or\r\n",
      "agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity\r\n",
      "of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no longer an\r\n",
      "integral.  But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the\r\n",
      "soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab's case, yielding up\r\n",
      "all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that\r\n",

      "poisonous miasmas, with all the other common perils incident to\r\n",
      "wandering in the heart of unknown regions.  Meanwhile, the whale he\r\n",

      "circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the coasts of\r\n",
      "Africa; but to no purpose.  This man and this whale again came\r\n",
      "together, and the one vanquished the other.  I say I, myself, have\r\n",
      "known three instances similar to this; that is in two of them I saw\r\n",

      "spouts, lowered her boats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales.\r\n",
      "Ere long, several of the whales were wounded; when, suddenly, a very\r\n",
      "large whale escaping from the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore\r\n",
      "directly down upon the ship.  Dashing his forehead against her hull,\r\n",
      "he so stove her in, that in less than \"ten minutes\" she settled down\r\n",
      "and fell over.  Not a surviving plank of her has been seen since.\r\n",
      "After the severest exposure, part of the crew reached the land in\r\n",
      "their boats.  Being returned home at last, Captain Pollard once more\r\n",
      "sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship, but the gods\r\n",
      "shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers; for the second\r\n",
      "time his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he\r\n",
      "has never tempted it since.  At this day Captain Pollard is a\r\n",

      "ship, at a short interval between them, both of which, according to\r\n",
      "their direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being\r\n",
      "made ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for\r\n",
      "the shock; to effect which, the exact manoeuvres which he made were\r\n",
      "necessary.  His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated\r\n",
      "resentment and fury.  He came directly from the shoal which we had\r\n",

      "the Commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso.  But\r\n",
      "he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale, that begged a few\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next\r\n",
      "day we were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh.  The weather\r\n",
      "was very clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged\r\n",
      "to keep on our fur clothing.  For some days we had very little wind;\r\n",
      "it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest\r\n",
      "sprang up.  An uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger\r\n",
      "than the ship itself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was\r\n",
      "not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship,\r\n",
      "which was in full sail, was almost upon him, so that it was\r\n",
      "impossible to prevent its striking against him.  We were thus placed\r\n",
      "in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature, setting up\r\n",
      "its back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the water.  The\r\n",
      "masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who were below\r\n",
      "all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck\r\n",
      "upon some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with\r\n",
      "the utmost gravity and solemnity.  Captain D'Wolf applied immediately\r\n",
      "to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any\r\n",
      "damage from the shock, but we found that very happily it had escaped\r\n",
      "entirely uninjured.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, the Captain D'Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in\r\n",
      "question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual\r\n",
      "adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of\r\n",
      "Dorchester near Boston.  I have the honour of being a nephew of his.\r\n",
      "I have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in\r\n",
      "Langsdorff.  He substantiates every word.  The ship, however, was by\r\n",
      "no means a large one: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast,\r\n",
      "and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he\r\n",
      "sailed from home.\r\n",

      "too, of honest wonders--the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient\r\n",
      "Dampier's old chums--I found a little matter set down so like that\r\n",
      "just quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here\r\n",
      "for a corroborative example, if such be needed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lionel, it seems, was on his way to \"John Ferdinando,\" as he calls\r\n",
      "the modern Juan Fernandes.  \"In our way thither,\" he says, \"about\r\n",
      "four o'clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty\r\n",
      "leagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock,\r\n",
      "which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell\r\n",
      "where they were or what to think; but every one began to prepare for\r\n",
      "death.  And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we\r\n",
      "took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the\r\n",
      "amazement was a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found\r\n",
      "no ground.  ....  The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in\r\n",
      "their carriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their\r\n",
      "hammocks.  Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was thrown\r\n",
      "out of his cabin!\"  Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an\r\n",
      "earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that\r\n",
      "a great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great\r\n",
      "mischief along the Spanish land.  But I should not much wonder if, in\r\n",
      "the darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after\r\n",
      "all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from\r\n",
      "beneath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known\r\n",
      "to me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale.  In\r\n",
      "more than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the\r\n",
      "assailing boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself,\r\n",
      "and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks.  The\r\n",
      "English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for\r\n",
      "his strength, let me say, that there have been examples where the\r\n",
      "lines attached to a running sperm whale have, in a calm, been\r\n",
      "transferred to the ship, and secured there; the whale towing her\r\n",
      "great hull through the water, as a horse walks off with a cart.\r\n",
      "Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm whale, once\r\n",
      "struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often with\r\n",
      "blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his\r\n",
      "pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his\r\n",
      "character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his\r\n",
      "mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive\r\n",
      "minutes.  But I must be content with only one more and a concluding\r\n",
      "illustration; a remarkable and most significant one, by which you\r\n",
      "will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous event in\r\n",
      "this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but that\r\n",
      "these marvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages; so\r\n",
      "that for the millionth time we say amen with Solomon--Verily there is\r\n",
      "nothing new under the sun.\r\n",

      "In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian\r\n",
      "magistrate of Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor\r\n",
      "and Belisarius general.  As many know, he wrote the history of his\r\n",
      "own times, a work every way of uncommon value.  By the best\r\n",
      "authorities, he has always been considered a most trustworthy and\r\n",

      "at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term\r\n",
      "of his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured\r\n",
      "in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having\r\n",
      "destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more\r\n",
      "than fifty years.  A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot\r\n",
      "easily be gainsaid.  Nor is there any reason it should be.  Of what\r\n",
      "precise species this sea-monster was, is not mentioned.  But as he\r\n",
      "destroyed ships, as well as for other reasons, he must have been a\r\n",

      "his chief peculiarity.  He would say the most terrific things to his\r\n",
      "crew, in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury\r\n",
      "seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman\r\n",
      "could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and\r\n",
      "yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing.  Besides he all the time\r\n",
      "looked so easy and indolent himself, so loungingly managed his\r\n",

      "mere sight of such a yawning commander, by sheer force of contrast,\r\n",
      "acted like a charm upon the crew.  Then again, Stubb was one of those\r\n",
      "odd sort of humorists, whose jollity is sometimes so curiously\r\n",
      "ambiguous, as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of\r\n",
      "obeying them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"Halloa!\" returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he\r\n",

      "come what will. (Spring, my men, spring!) There's hogsheads of sperm\r\n",
      "ahead, Mr. Stubb, and that's what ye came for. (Pull, my boys!)\r\n",

      "the ship's company; but Archy's fancied discovery having some time\r\n",

      "crew sat motionless on the sea.  Instantly the three spread boats in\r\n",

      "erect posture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most\r\n",
      "riotously perverse and cross-running seas.  Still more strange to see\r\n",

      "broad back, flaxen-haired Flask seemed a snow-flake.  The bearer\r\n",
      "looked nobler than the rider.  Though truly vivacious, tumultuous,\r\n",
      "ostentatious little Flask would now and then stamp with impatience;\r\n",
      "but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro's lordly\r\n",

      "water, and thin scattered puffs of vapour hovering over it, and\r\n",
      "suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white\r\n",
      "rolling billows.  The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it\r\n",

      "this atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin\r\n",
      "layer of water, also, the whales were swimming.  Seen in advance of\r\n",

      "not say much to his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to\r\n",
      "him.  Only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly\r\n",
      "pierced by one of his peculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now\r\n",
      "soft with entreaty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How different the loud little King-Post.  \"Sing out and say\r\n",

      "Merrily, merrily, hearts-alive.  Pudding for supper, you\r\n",
      "know;--merry's the word.  Pull, babes--pull, sucklings--pull, all.\r\n",
      "But what the devil are you hurrying about?  Softly, softly, and\r\n",
      "steadily, my men.  Only pull, and keep pulling; nothing more.  Crack\r\n",
      "all your backbones, and bite your knives in two--that's all.  Take it\r\n",

      "that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful\r\n",
      "look over the shoulder.  But this was against all rule; for the\r\n",
      "oarsmen must put out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their\r\n",

      "wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing down upon her boats with\r\n",
      "outstretched sails, like a wild hen after her screaming brood;--all\r\n",

      "blended, but tilted everywhere to right and left; the whales seemed\r\n",
      "separating their wakes.  The boats were pulled more apart; Starbuck\r\n",
      "giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward.  Our sail was\r\n",
      "now set, and, with the still rising wind, we rushed along; the boat\r\n",

      "imminent instant had come; they heard, too, an enormous wallowing\r\n",
      "sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter.  Meanwhile the\r\n",
      "boat was still booming through the mist, the waves curling and\r\n",
      "hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents.\r\n",

      "\"That's his hump.  THERE, THERE, give it to him!\" whispered Starbuck.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron\r\n",
      "of Queequeg.  Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push\r\n",
      "from astern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the\r\n",
      "sail collapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapour shot up near\r\n",
      "by; something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us.  The\r\n",
      "whole crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter\r\n",
      "into the white curdling cream of the squall.  Squall, whale, and\r\n",
      "harpoon had all blended together; and the whale, merely grazed by the\r\n",
      "iron, escaped.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed.  Swimming\r\n",
      "round it we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the\r\n",
      "gunwale, tumbled back to our places.  There we sat up to our knees in\r\n",
      "the sea, the water covering every rib and plank, so that to our\r\n",
      "downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up\r\n",
      "to us from the bottom of the ocean.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers\r\n",
      "together; the whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us\r\n",
      "like a white fire upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were\r\n",
      "burning; immortal in these jaws of death!  In vain we hailed the\r\n",
      "other boats; as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a\r\n",
      "flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm.  Meanwhile the\r\n",
      "driving scud, rack, and mist, grew darker with the shadows of night;\r\n",
      "no sign of the ship could be seen.  The rising sea forbade all\r\n",
      "attempts to bale out the boat.  The oars were useless as propellers,\r\n",
      "performing now the office of life-preservers.  So, cutting the\r\n",
      "lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many failures Starbuck\r\n",
      "contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then stretching it on a\r\n",
      "waif pole, handed it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of this\r\n",
      "forlorn hope.  There, then, he sat, holding up that imbecile candle\r\n",
      "in the heart of that almighty forlornness.  There, then, he sat, the\r\n",
      "sign and symbol of a man without faith, hopelessly holding up hope in\r\n",
      "the midst of despair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Wet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or\r\n",
      "boat, we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on.  The mist still\r\n",
      "spread over the sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of\r\n",
      "the boat.  Suddenly Queequeg started to his feet, hollowing his hand\r\n",
      "to his ear.  We all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards\r\n",
      "hitherto muffled by the storm.  The sound came nearer and nearer; the\r\n",
      "thick mists were dimly parted by a huge, vague form.  Affrighted, we\r\n",
      "all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view, bearing\r\n",
      "right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its\r\n",
      "length.\r\n",

      "manifested by several of her company; especially by Radney the mate.\r\n",
      "He commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew,\r\n",
      "and every way expanded to the breeze.  Now this Radney, I suppose,\r\n",

      "significantly his superior in general pride of manhood, straightway\r\n",
      "against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and\r\n",
      "bitterness; and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize\r\n",

      "I tell ye what, men, old Rad's investment must go for it! he had\r\n",
      "best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home.  The fact is,\r\n",
      "boys, that sword-fish only began the job; he's come back again with a\r\n",
      "gang of ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and\r\n",
      "the whole posse of 'em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at\r\n",

      "now, I'd tell him to jump overboard and scatter 'em.  They're playing\r\n",

      "soul,--Rad, and a beauty too.  Boys, they say the rest of his\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "'Aye, aye, sir,' said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket.  'Lively, boys,\r\n",
      "lively, now!'  And with that the pump clanged like fifty\r\n",
      "fire-engines; the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that\r\n",
      "peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest\r\n",
      "tension of life's utmost energies.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman\r\n",

      "face fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from\r\n",
      "his brow.  Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed\r\n",
      "Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated\r\n",
      "state, I know not; but so it happened.  Intolerably striding along\r\n",
      "the deck, the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the\r\n",
      "planks, and also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters\r\n",
      "consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship's deck at sea is a piece of\r\n",
      "household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly\r\n",
      "attended to every evening; it has been known to be done in the case\r\n",
      "of ships actually foundering at the time.  Such, gentlemen, is the\r\n",
      "inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in\r\n",
      "seamen; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing\r\n",
      "their faces.  But in all vessels this broom business is the\r\n",
      "prescriptive province of the boys, if boys there be aboard.  Besides,\r\n",
      "it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that had been divided into\r\n",
      "gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most athletic seaman\r\n",
      "of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of\r\n",
      "the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial\r\n",
      "business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the\r\n",
      "case with his comrades.  I mention all these particulars so that you\r\n",
      "may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost\r\n",

      "spat in his face.  Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will\r\n",
      "understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman\r\n",
      "fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command.  But as he sat\r\n",
      "still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's\r\n",
      "malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in\r\n",
      "him and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he\r\n",
      "instinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and\r\n",
      "unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already\r\n",
      "ireful being--a repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really\r\n",
      "valiant men even when aggrieved--this nameless phantom feeling,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily\r\n",
      "exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that\r\n",
      "sweeping the deck was not his business, and he would not do it.  And\r\n",
      "then, without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three\r\n",
      "lads as the customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the\r\n",
      "pumps, had done little or nothing all day.  To this, Radney replied\r\n",
      "with an oath, in a most domineering and outrageous manner\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily\r\n",
      "followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated\r\n",
      "his intention not to obey.  Seeing, however, that his forbearance had\r\n",
      "not the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with\r\n",
      "his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it\r\n",
      "was to no purpose.  And in this way the two went once slowly round\r\n",
      "the windlass; when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking\r\n",
      "him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"'Mr. Radney, I will not obey you.  Take that hammer away, or look to\r\n",
      "yourself.'  But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him,\r\n",
      "where the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an\r\n",
      "inch of his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable\r\n",
      "maledictions.  Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch;\r\n",
      "stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance,\r\n",

      "I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,\r\n",
      "something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to\r\n",
      "the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is\r\n",
      "moored alongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon\r\n",
      "there.  It may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to\r\n",
      "those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the\r\n",
      "present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman.  It is\r\n",
      "time to set the world right in this matter, by proving such pictures\r\n",
      "of the whale all wrong.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions\r\n",
      "will be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian\r\n",
      "sculptures.  For ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times\r\n",
      "when on the marble panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues,\r\n",
      "and on shields, medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in\r\n",
      "scales of chain-armor like Saladin's, and a helmeted head like St.\r\n",
      "George's; ever since then has something of the same sort of license\r\n",
      "prevailed, not only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in\r\n",
      "many scientific presentations of him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting\r\n",
      "to be the whale's, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of\r\n",
      "Elephanta, in India.  The Brahmins maintain that in the almost\r\n",
      "endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and\r\n",
      "pursuits, every conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages\r\n",
      "before any of them actually came into being.  No wonder then, that in\r\n",
      "some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there\r\n",
      "shadowed forth.  The Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate\r\n",
      "department of the wall, depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the\r\n",
      "form of leviathan, learnedly known as the Matse Avatar.  But though\r\n",
      "this sculpture is half man and half whale, so as only to give the\r\n",
      "tail of the latter, yet that small section of him is all wrong.  It\r\n",
      "looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda, than the broad palms\r\n",
      "of the true whale's majestic flukes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian\r\n",
      "painter's portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the\r\n",
      "antediluvian Hindoo.  It is Guido's picture of Perseus rescuing\r\n",
      "Andromeda from the sea-monster or whale.  Where did Guido get the\r\n",
      "model of such a strange creature as that?  Nor does Hogarth, in\r\n",
      "painting the same scene in his own \"Perseus Descending,\" make out one\r\n",
      "whit better.  The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster\r\n",
      "undulates on the surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water.  It has\r\n",
      "a sort of howdah on its back, and its distended tusked mouth into\r\n",
      "which the billows are rolling, might be taken for the Traitors' Gate\r\n",
      "leading from the Thames by water into the Tower.  Then, there are the\r\n",
      "Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah's whale, as\r\n",
      "depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers.\r\n",
      "What shall be said of these?  As for the book-binder's whale winding\r\n",
      "like a vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor--as stamped\r\n",
      "and gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both old and\r\n",
      "new--that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature,\r\n",
      "imitated, I take it, from the like figures on antique vases.  Though\r\n",
      "universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless call this\r\n",
      "book-binder's fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so intended\r\n",
      "when the device was first introduced.  It was introduced by an old\r\n",
      "Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the\r\n",
      "Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a\r\n",
      "comparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a\r\n",
      "species of the Leviathan.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you\r\n",
      "will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all\r\n",
      "manner of spouts, jets d'eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and\r\n",
      "Baden-Baden, come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain.  In the\r\n",
      "title-page of the original edition of the \"Advancement of Learning\"\r\n",
      "you will find some curious whales.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at\r\n",
      "those pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific\r\n",
      "delineations, by those who know.  In old Harris's collection of\r\n",
      "voyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book\r\n",
      "of voyages, A.D. 1671, entitled \"A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in\r\n",
      "the ship Jonas in the Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.\"\r\n",
      "In one of those plates the whales, like great rafts of logs, are\r\n",
      "represented lying among ice-isles, with white bears running over\r\n",
      "their living backs.  In another plate, the prodigious blunder is made\r\n",
      "of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain\r\n",
      "Colnett, a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled \"A Voyage round\r\n",
      "Cape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the\r\n",
      "Spermaceti Whale Fisheries.\"  In this book is an outline purporting\r\n",
      "to be a \"Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale\r\n",
      "from one killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on\r\n",
      "deck.\"  I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for\r\n",
      "the benefit of his marines.  To mention but one thing about it, let\r\n",
      "me say that it has an eye which applied, according to the\r\n",
      "accompanying scale, to a full grown sperm whale, would make the eye\r\n",
      "of that whale a bow-window some five feet long.  Ah, my gallant\r\n",
      "captain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that eye!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for\r\n",
      "the benefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness\r\n",
      "of mistake.  Look at that popular work \"Goldsmith's Animated Nature.\"\r\n",
      "In the abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an\r\n",
      "alleged \"whale\" and a \"narwhale.\"  I do not wish to seem inelegant,\r\n",
      "but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as\r\n",
      "for the narwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in\r\n",
      "this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine\r\n",
      "upon any intelligent public of schoolboys.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacepede, a great\r\n",
      "naturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are\r\n",
      "several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan.  All\r\n",
      "these are not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or\r\n",
      "Greenland whale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a\r\n",
      "long experienced man as touching that species, declares not to have\r\n",
      "its counterpart in nature.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was\r\n",
      "reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous\r\n",
      "Baron.  In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which\r\n",
      "he gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale.  Before showing\r\n",
      "that picture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your\r\n",
      "summary retreat from Nantucket.  In a word, Frederick Cuvier's Sperm\r\n",
      "Whale is not a Sperm Whale, but a squash.  Of course, he never had\r\n",
      "the benefit of a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he\r\n",
      "derived that picture, who can tell?  Perhaps he got it as his\r\n",
      "scientific predecessor in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his\r\n",
      "authentic abortions; that is, from a Chinese drawing.  And what sort\r\n",
      "of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are, many queer cups and\r\n",
      "saucers inform us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for the sign-painters' whales seen in the streets hanging over the\r\n",
      "shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them?  They are generally\r\n",
      "Richard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage;\r\n",
      "breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full\r\n",
      "of mariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue\r\n",
      "paint.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very\r\n",
      "surprising after all.  Consider!  Most of the scientific drawings\r\n",
      "have been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as\r\n",
      "correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would\r\n",
      "correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride\r\n",
      "of hull and spars.  Though elephants have stood for their\r\n",
      "full-lengths, the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated\r\n",
      "himself for his portrait.  The living whale, in his full majesty and\r\n",
      "significance, is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters; and\r\n",
      "afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight, like a launched\r\n",
      "line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a thing eternally\r\n",
      "impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so as to\r\n",
      "preserve all his mighty swells and undulations.  And, not to speak of\r\n",
      "the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking\r\n",
      "whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of\r\n",
      "one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship's deck, such is\r\n",
      "then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that\r\n",
      "his precise expression the devil himself could not catch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded\r\n",
      "whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form.  Not at\r\n",
      "all.  For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan,\r\n",
      "that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape.\r\n",

      "calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set.  Presently, as\r\n",
      "we thus glided in chase, the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail\r\n",
      "forty feet into the air, and then sank out of sight like a tower\r\n",

      "be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea.  So Ahab's\r\n",
      "proceedings in this matter were not unusual; the only strange thing\r\n",

      "wooing vacancies to leeward.  It was only an instant; for again his\r\n",
      "eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle.\r\n",

      "could discover no sign in the sea.  But suddenly as he peered down\r\n",
      "and down into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no\r\n",
      "bigger than a white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and\r\n",
      "magnifying as it rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly\r\n",
      "revealed two long crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating\r\n",
      "up from the undiscoverable bottom.  It was Moby Dick's open mouth and\r\n",
      "scrolled jaw; his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the\r\n",
      "blue of the sea.  The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like\r\n",
      "an open-doored marble tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his\r\n",
      "steering oar, Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous\r\n",
      "apparition.  Then, calling upon Fedallah to change places with him,\r\n",
      "went forward to the bows, and seizing Perth's harpoon, commanded his\r\n",
      "crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,\r\n",
      "its bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale's head while yet\r\n",
      "under water.  But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with\r\n",
      "that malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted\r\n",
      "himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head\r\n",
      "lengthwise beneath the boat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled\r\n",
      "for an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner\r\n",
      "of a biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within\r\n",
      "his mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high\r\n",
      "up into the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock.  The\r\n",
      "bluish pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of\r\n",
      "Ahab's head, and reached higher than that.  In this attitude the\r\n",
      "White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her\r\n",
      "mouse.  With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms;\r\n",
      "but the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other's heads to\r\n",
      "gain the uttermost stern.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as\r\n",
      "the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and\r\n",
      "from his body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be\r\n",
      "darted at from the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as\r\n",
      "it were; and while the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a\r\n",
      "quick crisis impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac\r\n",
      "Ahab, furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed\r\n",
      "him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with\r\n",
      "all this, he seized the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly\r\n",
      "strove to wrench it from its gripe.  As now he thus vainly strove,\r\n",
      "the jaw slipped from him; the frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and\r\n",
      "snapped, as both jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding further aft,\r\n",
      "bit the craft completely in twain, and locked themselves fast again\r\n",
      "in the sea, midway between the two floating wrecks.  These floated\r\n",
      "aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the stern-wreck clinging\r\n",
      "to the gunwales, and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them\r\n",
      "across.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the\r\n",
      "first to perceive the whale's intent, by the crafty upraising of his\r\n",
      "head, a movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment\r\n",
      "his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite.\r\n",
      "But only slipping further into the whale's mouth, and tilting over\r\n",
      "sideways as it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw;\r\n",
      "spilled him out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell\r\n",
      "flat-faced upon the sea.\r\n",

      "Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little\r\n",
      "distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in\r\n",
      "the billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled\r\n",
      "body; so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose--some twenty or\r\n",
      "more feet out of the water--the now rising swells, with all their\r\n",
      "confluent waves, dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing\r\n",
      "their shivered spray still higher into the air.*  So, in a gale, the\r\n",

      "deadly assault.  The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden\r\n",
      "him, as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus's\r\n",
      "elephants in the book of Maccabees.  Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in\r\n",
      "the foam of the whale's insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to\r\n",
      "swim,--though he could still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a\r\n",
      "whirlpool as that; helpless Ahab's head was seen, like a tossed\r\n",
      "bubble which the least chance shock might burst.  From the boat's\r\n",
      "fragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him; the\r\n",
      "clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not succor him; more\r\n",
      "than enough was it for them to look to themselves.  For so\r\n",
      "revolvingly appalling was the White Whale's aspect, and so\r\n",
      "planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made, that he\r\n",
      "seemed horizontally swooping upon them.  And though the other boats,\r\n",
      "unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into the\r\n",

      "and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways outstretching it with\r\n",
      "stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an albatross; the Pequod\r\n",
      "bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick.  At the well known,\r\n",

      "on all sides routed, as timid prairie hares that scatter before the\r\n",

      "their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark; by all these\r\n",
      "things, their hearts were bowled along.  The wind that made great\r\n",

      "maple, and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp--yet all these ran\r\n",

      "balanced and directed by the long central keel; even so, all the\r\n",
      "individualities of the crew, this man's valor, that man's fear; guilt\r\n",
      "and guiltiness, all varieties were welded into oneness, and were all\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The rigging lived.  The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were\r\n",

      "infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?\" cried Ahab, when, after\r\n",
      "the lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been\r\n",
      "heard.  \"Sway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken\r\n",
      "some other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon\r\n",
      "proved; for hardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope\r\n",
      "belayed to its pin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an\r\n",
      "orchestra, that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharges\r\n",
      "of rifles.  The triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard,\r\n",
      "as--much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet, less\r\n",
      "than a mile ahead--Moby Dick bodily burst into view!  For not by any\r\n",
      "calm and indolent spoutings; not by the peaceable gush of that mystic\r\n",
      "fountain in his head, did the White Whale now reveal his vicinity;\r\n",
      "but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching.  Rising with\r\n",
      "his utmost velocity from the furthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus\r\n",
      "booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air, and piling up a\r\n",
      "mountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to the distance of seven\r\n",
      "miles and more.  In those moments, the torn, enraged waves he shakes\r\n",
      "off, seem his mane; in some cases, this breaching is his act of\r\n",
      "defiance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There she breaches! there she breaches!\" was the cry, as in his\r\n",
      "immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to\r\n",
      "Heaven.  So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved\r\n",
      "against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised,\r\n",
      "for the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and\r\n",
      "stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling\r\n",
      "intensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!\" cried Ahab, \"thy hour\r\n",
      "and thy harpoon are at hand!--Down! down all of ye, but one man at\r\n",
      "the fore.  The boats!--stand by!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like\r\n",
      "shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and\r\n",
      "halyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped\r\n",
      "from his perch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Lower away,\" he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat--a spare\r\n",
      "one, rigged the afternoon previous.  \"Mr. Starbuck, the ship is\r\n",
      "thine--keep away from the boats, but keep near them.  Lower, all!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the\r\n",
      "first assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for\r\n",
      "the three crews.  Ahab's boat was central; and cheering his men, he\r\n",
      "told them he would take the whale head-and-head,--that is, pull\r\n",
      "straight up to his forehead,--a not uncommon thing; for when within a\r\n",
      "certain limit, such a course excludes the coming onset from the\r\n",
      "whale's sidelong vision.  But ere that close limit was gained, and\r\n",
      "while yet all three boats were plain as the ship's three masts to his\r\n",
      "eye; the White Whale churning himself into furious speed, almost in\r\n",
      "an instant as it were, rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a\r\n",
      "lashing tail, offered appalling battle on every side; and heedless of\r\n",
      "the irons darted at him from every boat, seemed only intent on\r\n",
      "annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made.  But\r\n",
      "skilfully manoeuvred, incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in\r\n",
      "the field; the boats for a while eluded him; though, at times, but by\r\n",
      "a plank's breadth; while all the time, Ahab's unearthly slogan tore\r\n",
      "every other cry but his to shreds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed\r\n",
      "and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the\r\n",
      "three lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of\r\n",
      "themselves, warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in\r\n",
      "him; though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to\r\n",
      "rally for a more tremendous charge.  Seizing that opportunity, Ahab\r\n",
      "first paid out more line: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking\r\n",
      "in upon it again--hoping that way to disencumber it of some\r\n",
      "snarls--when lo!--a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of\r\n",
      "sharks!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Caught and twisted--corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose\r\n",
      "harpoons and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came\r\n",
      "flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab's boat.\r\n",
      "Only one thing could be done.  Seizing the boat-knife, he critically\r\n",
      "reached within--through--and then, without--the rays of steel;\r\n",
      "dragged in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and\r\n",
      "then, twice sundering the rope near the chocks--dropped the\r\n",
      "intercepted fagot of steel into the sea; and was all fast again.\r\n",
      "That instant, the White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining\r\n",
      "tangles of the other lines; by so doing, irresistibly dragged the\r\n",
      "more involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes; dashed\r\n",
      "them together like two rolling husks on a surf-beaten beach, and\r\n",
      "then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a boiling maelstrom,\r\n",
      "in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced\r\n",
      "round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of\r\n",
      "punch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out\r\n",
      "after the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture,\r\n",
      "while aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial,\r\n",
      "twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and\r\n",
      "Stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while\r\n",
      "the old man's line--now parting--admitted of his pulling into the\r\n",
      "creamy pool to rescue whom he could;--in that wild simultaneousness\r\n",
      "of a thousand concreted perils,--Ahab's yet unstricken boat seemed\r\n",
      "drawn up towards Heaven by invisible wires,--as, arrow-like, shooting\r\n",
      "perpendicularly from the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad\r\n",
      "forehead against its bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into\r\n",
      "the air; till it fell again--gunwale downwards--and Ahab and his men\r\n",
      "struggled out from under it, like seals from a sea-side cave.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first uprising momentum of the whale--modifying its direction as\r\n",
      "he struck the surface--involuntarily launched him along it, to a\r\n",
      "little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and\r\n",
      "with his back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his\r\n",
      "flukes from side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the\r\n",
      "least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly\r\n",
      "drew back, and came sideways smiting the sea.  But soon, as if\r\n",
      "satisfied that his work for that time was done, he pushed his pleated\r\n",
      "forehead through the ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled\r\n",
      "lines, continued his leeward way at a traveller's methodic pace.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again\r\n",
      "came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the\r\n",
      "floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at,\r\n",
      "and safely landed them on her decks.  Some sprained shoulders,\r\n",
      "wrists, and ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances;\r\n",
      "inextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all\r\n",
      "these were there; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have\r\n",
      "befallen any one.  As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now\r\n",
      "found grimly clinging to his boat's broken half, which afforded a\r\n",
      "comparatively easy float; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous\r\n",
      "day's mishap.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him;\r\n",
      "as instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the\r\n",

      "him.  His ivory leg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "with trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot\r\n",
      "lengthwise, but obliquely from the sea.  Shrouded in a thin drooping\r\n",
      "veil of mist, it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then\r\n",
      "fell swamping back into the deep.  Crushed thirty feet upwards, the\r\n",

      "together; as head on, he came churning his tail among the boats; and\r\n",
      "once more flailed them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with\r\n",
      "the corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last\r\n",
      "encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was\r\n",
      "now again steadily swimming forward; and had almost passed the\r\n",
      "ship,--which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to\r\n",
      "him, though for the present her headway had been stopped.  He seemed\r\n",
      "swimming with his utmost velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing\r\n",
      "his own straight path in the sea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!  Ahab,\" cried Starbuck, \"not too late is it, even now, the third\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Setting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled\r\n",

      "sliding by the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck's\r\n",
      "face as he leaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel\r\n",
      "about, and follow him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval.\r\n",
      "Glancing upwards, he saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly\r\n",
      "mounting to the three mast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in\r\n",
      "the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side, and\r\n",
      "were busily at work in repairing them.  One after the other, through\r\n",
      "the port-holes, as he sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb\r\n",
      "and Flask, busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and\r\n",
      "lances.  As he saw all this; as he heard the hammers in the broken\r\n",
      "boats; far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart.  But\r\n",
      "he rallied.  And now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the\r\n",
      "main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had just gained that\r\n",
      "perch, to descend again for another flag, and a hammer and nails, and\r\n",
      "so nail it to the mast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whether fagged by the three days' running chase, and the resistance\r\n",
      "to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some\r\n",
      "latent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White\r\n",
      "Whale's way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so\r\n",
      "rapidly nearing him once more; though indeed the whale's last start\r\n",
      "had not been so long a one as before.  And still as Ahab glided over\r\n",
      "the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously\r\n",
      "stuck to the boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that\r\n",
      "the blades became jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in\r\n",
      "the sea, at almost every dip.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars.  Pull\r\n",
      "on! 'tis the better rest, the shark's jaw than the yielding water.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "At length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along\r\n",

      "with body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the\r\n",
      "poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the\r\n",
      "hated whale.  As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if\r\n",
      "sucked into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically\r\n",
      "rolled his nigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in\r\n",
      "it, so suddenly canted the boat over, that had it not been for the\r\n",
      "elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung, Ahab would once\r\n",
      "more have been tossed into the sea.  As it was, three of the\r\n",
      "oarsmen--who foreknew not the precise instant of the dart, and were\r\n",
      "therefore unprepared for its effects--these were flung out; but so\r\n",
      "fell, that, in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again, and\r\n",
      "rising to its level on a combing wave, hurled themselves bodily\r\n",
      "inboard again; the third man helplessly dropping astern, but still\r\n",
      "afloat and swimming.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,\r\n",
      "instantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering\r\n",

      "the line, and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on\r\n",
      "their seats, and tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the\r\n",

      "seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking\r\n",
      "it--it may be--a larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down\r\n",
