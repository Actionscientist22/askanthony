# Bank Account Class

In this activity, you'll practice creating class methods to modify an instance of the `BankAccount` class. You'll prompt the user to input the starting balance and their paycheck amount. Using the `deposit` method, you'll add the paycheck amount to the account balance. Then, you'll prompt the user to input an amount to withdraw and use the `withdraw` method to subtract that amount from the balance.

Finally, you'll print out the updated account balance after each transaction. This activity allows you to simulate a basic banking scenario and demonstrates how class methods can be used to interact with and modify an instance of the `BankAccount` class.

## Instructions

Open [banking.py](Unsolved/banking.py) in the Unsolved folder, and then complete the following steps:

* Import the `BankAccount` class from the [BankAccount.py](Unsolved/BankAccount.py) file.

* Create an instance of the `BankAccount` class that sets the user's starting balance.

* Pass the user's pay to the `deposit` method of the `BankAccount` using the instance of the `BankAccount` class.

* Display the balance of the savings account with the new pay and format the amount to two decimal places and thousands.

* Pass the user's desired withdrawal amount to the `withdraw` method using the instance of the `BankAccount` class.

* Display the balance of the savings account after the withdrawal and format the amount to two decimal places and thousands.
