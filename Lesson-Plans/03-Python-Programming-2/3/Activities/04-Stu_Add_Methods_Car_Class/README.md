# Adding Car Class Methods

In this activity, you'll practice creating class methods to modify an instance of the `Car` class. You'll prompt the user to input the three new parameters of the car. Next, you'll pass each parameter to the new methods you created. Finally, you'll print out the updated information about the car. This activity allows you to demonstrate how class methods can be used to interact with and modify an instance of the `Car` class.

## Instructions

Open [adding_car_class_methods.py](Unsolved/adding_car_class_methods.py) in the Unsolved folder, and then complete the following steps:

* Create three setter methods to change three parameters of the `Car` class.

* Prompt the user to change the three attributes of the car.

* Pass the updated car information from the user to the setter methods you created.

* Print the updated information of the car.

## Hints

* When prompting the user to change the parameters, create new variables for each parameter.
