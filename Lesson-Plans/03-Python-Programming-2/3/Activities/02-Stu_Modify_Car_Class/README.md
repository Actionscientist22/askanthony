# Modifying the Car Class

In this activity, you'll practice adding parameters to a class, creating class methods, and creating an instance of the class that passes parameters to the class based on the inputs of a user.

## Instructions

Open [import_car_loan_function.py](Unsolved/car_class.py) in the Unsolved folder, and then complete the following steps:

* Initialize the `Car` class with the following six parameters: "make", "model", "body", "engine", "year", and "color".

* Create instance variables for each parameter.

* Prompt the user to enter the information for the car for each parameter.

* Create an instance of the `Car` class and pass in the variables from the user.

* Print the details of the car based on the user inputs.


## Hints

* Don't forget the `self` parameter in the `__init__()` constructor.
* Make sure the year is an integer.
