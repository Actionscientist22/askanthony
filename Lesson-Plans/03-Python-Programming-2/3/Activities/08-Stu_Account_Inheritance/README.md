# Account Inheritance

In this activity, you'll practice creating class methods and attributes for a `SavingsAccount` and `CD` class. Then, you'll import and use `SavingsAccount` and `CD` classes in a new Python file.

In the Python file, you'll prompt the user to input the savings balance and interest rate for their account. Then, you'll create an instance of the `SavingsAccount` class to set the users savings account balance and interest.

Next, you'll prompt the user to input the CD balance, interest rate, and length of months for the CD. Then, you'll create an instance of the `CD` class to set the user’s CD account balance, interest, and length of the CD. Finally, you'll print out the savings account and CD data for the user.

This activity allows you to simulate a basic banking scenario and demonstrates how to use class inheritance and methods to interact with different classes.

## Instructions

### Creating Classes

Open [Accounts.py](Unsolved/Accounts.py) in the Unsolved folder, and then complete the following steps:

1. Create a `SavingsAccount` class with the balance and interest rate parameters and attributes.

2. Have the `get_balance` and `get_interest` methods return the appropriate attributes.

3. The `CD` inherits all the parameters and attributes from the `SavingsAccount` class. For the `CD` class, add the month parameter and attribute for the length of the CD.

4. Have the `get_months` method return the appropriate attribute.

### Importing and Using Classes

Next, open [account_inheritance.py](Unsolved/account_inheritance.py) in the Unsolved folder, and then complete the following steps:

1. Import the `SavingsAccount` and `CD` classes from the [BankAccount.py](Unsolved/BankAccount.py) file.

2. Prompt the user to set the savings balance and interest rate for their account.

3. Create an instance of the `SavingsAccount` class that sets the user’s savings account balance and interest.

4. Prompt the user to set the CD balance, interest rate, and months for the CD.

5. Create an instance of the `CD` class that sets the user’s CD account balance, interest, and length of months.

6. Display the savings account and CD data for the user.
