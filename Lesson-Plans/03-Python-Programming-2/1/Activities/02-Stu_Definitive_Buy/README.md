# A Definitive Buy

In this activity, you're building the back end of a new payment processing system. Each time a payment occurs through your system, a $0.75 fee is charged to the merchant who uses it. As this will be run on millions of transactions, your task is to write a single, reusable function for this process.

## Instructions

Open `a_definitive_buy.py` in the Unsolved folder, and then complete the following steps:

* Define a new function and name it `process_payment`.

* In the first line of the function, print the total transaction fee charged. For example, "The total cost of this transaction will be 75 cents."

* In the second line of the function, print a notification that the charge was processed successfully. For example, "Ka-ching! Payment has been processed."

* Call the function. Does it do what you expected it to?
