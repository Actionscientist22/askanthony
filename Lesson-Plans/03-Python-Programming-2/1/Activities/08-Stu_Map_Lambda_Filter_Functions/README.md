# Map, Lambda, and Filter Functions

In this activity, you’ll practice using the `map`, `lambda` and `filter` functions.

## Instructions

Open the [anonymous_functions.py](Unsolved/anonymous_functions.py) file and complete the following steps:

* Get the even numbers from the following list using the `filter` and `lambda` functions.

    ```text
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    ```

* Use the `map` and `lambda` functions to add the numbers from both lists.

    ```text
    numbers1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    numbers2 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
    ```

* Use the `map` and `lambda` functions to split the following sentence into words.

    ```text
    sentence = "My favorite hobby is coding in Python"
    ```
