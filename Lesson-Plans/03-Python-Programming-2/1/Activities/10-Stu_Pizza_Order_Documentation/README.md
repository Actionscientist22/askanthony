# Documenting the Pizza Order Function.

In this activity, you’ll practice adding a docstring that describes what a function does, and add one-line documentation to explain what the code does.

## Instructions

Open the [pizza_order.py](Unsolved/pizza_order.py) file and complete the following steps:

* Add a docstring to the `create_pizza_order` function. The docstring must describe what the function does, what arguments it uses, what the function returns or prints, and what errors are raised, if any.

* Next, add one-line documentation in the body of the function to provide a description of what the code is doing.
