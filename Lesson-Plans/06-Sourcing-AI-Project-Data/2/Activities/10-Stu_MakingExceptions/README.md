# Making Exceptions

## Introduction

In this activity, you will create an application that uses `try` and `except` to resolve a number of errors.

## Instructions

1. Without removing any of the lines from the provided starter code, create try-except blocks that will allow the application to run without terminating.

2. Each `except` block should handle the specific error that will occur.

3. Add a `print` statement under the `except` block to log the error.
