# API Mini Project

## Introduction

You will work in small groups to explore API documentation, then develop an application that sources data from your chosen API, before returning to the whole class to discuss and share your experience.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Explore Documentation

As a group, spend some time exploring the documentation for up to three of the APIs listed below. **Note**: A ✔️ indicates that you will need to use an API key you previously created with these APIs. A ☆ indicates an API that may require you to sign up for a new API key.

* [World Health Organization GHO API](https://www.who.int/data/gho/info/gho-odata-api)

* [New York Times APIs](https://developer.nytimes.com/apis)✔️

* [TVMaze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api)

* The Movie Database [Docs](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/finding-data) and [Reference](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started)☆

* [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)✔️

* [World Bank](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/898581-api-basic-call-structure)

* [Exchange Rate API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/docs/standard-requests)☆

* [Environmental Protection Agency Air Quality System (AQS) API](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html)☆

* [openFDA (US Food & Drug Administration) API](https://open.fda.gov/apis/)

* [Realtime Weather Readings Across Singapore](https://beta.data.gov.sg/datasets/1459/view)

* [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api)

* [The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API](https://metmuseum.github.io/)

* [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/documentation)

After exploring the documentation, decide which API you would like to use for your application.

### Part 2: Write Application

Build an interactive application that allows a user to make requests from your chosen API. Try to incorporate the following features:

* Include user input that determines the API call.

* Use the results of one API call to provide the user choices for a related API call (e.g., looking up an author provides book results, and a user could then select from those books to look up).

* Use `try` and `except` for exception handling when the API does not return a result with the required data.

* Convert results to a Pandas DataFrame.

You may begin building this application within a Jupyter Notebook file. If time permits, for an extra challenge, convert the code to a Python script that can run from the command line.

### Part 3: Discuss and Share

Return to the full class to discuss and share your experience.
