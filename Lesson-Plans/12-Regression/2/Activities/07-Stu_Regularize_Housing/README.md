# Ridge and Lasso Regression

## Introduction

In this activity, you'll implement ridge regression on housing data and compare the results to linear regression. Then, you'll implement lasso regression to examine which features may be unnecessary to the model.

## Instructions

1. Perform ridge regression on the real estate dataset. The target variable in the dataset is the house price of the unit area.

    * Be sure to split the data into training and testing sets.

    * Be sure to standardize the data.

    * Use an initial alpha value of 1.

    * Create a ridge regression model and assess its MSE.

    * Use `RidgeCV` to optimize for alpha. Use the following alpha values: 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10. Which of these is the best?

2. Next, create a linear regression model and compare its MSE with that of the ridge regression model. Which has a lower MSE?

3. Finally, create a lasso regression model. While you have not yet seen a lasso regression model, its implementation in Python is very similar to that of ridge regression.

    * Use the [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Lasso.html) to train the model on the data. Use an alpha value of 1.

4. Assess its MSE. How does it compare to that of the ridge regression?
