# Predicting Sales Linear Regression

## Introduction

You and some friends have created the ultimate child seat. It's a light and water-resistant car seat that can be folded and stored in a backpack; it's the perfect solution for families traveling with children.

You wanted to spread the word about your invention, so you decided to run a digital marketing campaign using online ads. After running the campaign for a few days, displaying a different number of ads each day, you decide to create a model to predict the expected sales on any given day, depending on the number of ads you show that day.

You realize that this is an excellent opportunity to use your linear regression skills to create a prediction model.

## Instructions

Use the Jupyter notebook in the `Unsolved` folder to complete the following steps:

1. Load and visualize the sales data.

2. Prepare the data to fit the linear regression model.

3. Build the linear regression model using the `LinearRegression` module of Scikit-learn.

4. Plot the line of best fit for the sales prediction model.

5. Use the linear regression model to manually predict the sales with 100 ads.

6. Make predictions using the `predict` function of the `LinearRegression` module.
