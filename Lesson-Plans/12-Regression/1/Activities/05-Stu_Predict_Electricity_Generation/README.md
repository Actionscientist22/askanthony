# Predict Electricity Generation

## Introduction

You have been supplied with historical data about electricity generation in Ghana. Using this data, you will train a linear regression model that can be used to make predictions of how much electricity will need to be generated in future years. Then you will evaluate the model.

## Instructions

Use the Jupyter notebook in the `Unsolved` folder to complete the following steps:

1. Load and visualize the total electricity generation data.

2. Prepare the data to fit the linear regression model.

3. Build the linear regression model using the `LinearRegression` module of scikit-learn.

4. Plot the line of best fit for the electricity generation prediction model.

5. Use the linear regression model to manually predict the electricity generation for 2023.

6. Make predictions using the `predict` function of the `LinearRegression` module for years 2000–2023.

7. Use the predictions to compute the metrics for the linear regression model. Evaluate the model using the following metrics: `score`, `r2`, `mse`, `rmse`.
