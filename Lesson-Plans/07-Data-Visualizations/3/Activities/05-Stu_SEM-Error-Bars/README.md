# SEM and Error Bars

In this activity, you will work with a partner to characterize sample data from a California housing dataset. Make sure to compare your calculated values with your partner's values as you progress through the activity.

## Instructions

Work with a partner on this activity. Be sure to compare your calculated values as you progress through the activity.

1. Open the starter notebook from the unsolved folder.

2. Execute the starter code to import the California housing dataset from Scikit-learn. Read the description, then store the data in a DataFrame.

3. Create multiple sample sets of median housing prices using Pandas. Set the sample size to 20.

4. Calculate the means and standard errors for each sample.

5. Create a plot displaying the means for each sample, with the standard error as error bars.

6. Calculate the range of SEM values across the sample set.

7. Determine which sample's mean is closest to the population mean.

8. Compare this sample's mean to the population's mean.

9. Rerun your sampling code a few times to generate new sample sets. Try changing the sample size and then rerunning the sampling code.

10. Discuss with your partner what changes you observe when sample size changes.
