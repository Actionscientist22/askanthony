# Temperature Outliers

In this activity, you will search for outliers in a dataset that contains contains National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration temperature measurements taken at the Los Angeles International (LAX) airport.

## Instructions

* Read the LAX temperature dataset into a dataframe.

* Filter the dataset to only include the `HourlyDryBulbTemperature` column.

* Create a boxplot to visualize the filtered dataset. Make sure to include a title and a y-axis label. Look at the box plot. What do you notice about the outliers in the dataset from this visualization?

* Use Pandas to calculate the quartiles, IQR, and median. Display these values.

* Use the IQR to determine an upper and lower bound for outliers, then print the results.
