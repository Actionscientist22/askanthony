# Library Usage

In this activity, you will create a pair of charts based on library usage collected from San Francisco. This dataset includes information on library patrons who became patrons of San Francisco Public Library between 2003 and 2016, and tracks their library usage during that period.

## Instructions

* Open the starter file and follow the prompts to import, split, and summarize the library dataset.

* Create a bar chart by using Pandas and Matplotlib that visualizes how many patrons checked out items by patron type.

* Create a bar chart by using Pandas and Matplotlib that can be used to visualize the total checkouts by patron type of a single home branch location (or `Home Library Definition`).

  * **Note:** Since there are quite a lot of patron types with minimal checkouts, you may like to include a filter to limit the minimum number of total checkouts by patron group.
