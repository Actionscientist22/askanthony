# Softmax and Sigmoid

## Introduction

Consider the following scenarios and determine whether the activation function should be softmax or sigmoid.

## Instructions

For each of the following scenarios, determine whether softmax or sigmoid is the best activation function choice.

1. A CNN is created to predict whether an image has one vegetable or multiple vegetables present, along with whether the vegetables are green or red. These labels are broken into four columns: one_vegetable, multiple_vegetables, red, and green. If these columns are predicted using a single layer, which activation function would be best suited?

2. A neural network is created to evaluate whether a particular item in an online store will next month sell more units, fewer units, or the same number of units. Each potential outcome has its own column.

3. A neural network is designed to predict whether a flower belongs to the following groups: Species A, Species B, Species C, or Large petal variant (any species). If these four columns are predicted using one layer, which activation function would be best?
