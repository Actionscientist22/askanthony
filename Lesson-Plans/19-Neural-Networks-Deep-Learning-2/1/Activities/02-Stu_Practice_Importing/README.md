# Practice Importing

## Introduction

You will use Pillow and the requests library to import an image, view the image, and view or modify various attributes of the image.

## Instructions

Use the Jupyter notebook in the `Unsolved` folder to complete the following steps:

1. Use the requests library to request the image.

2. Use Image.open to open the image.

3. View the image. Note that images in this dataset are of microscopic fungi samples. The images may not look recognizable but that is expected.

4. View the size of the image.

5. View the format of the image.

6. Resize the image to 128 by 128.

7. Rotate the image 45 degrees.

8. Research what other methods are available using the [Pillow documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image). Try a few other methods.
